<p>The highest peak of Jue Mountain is the <strong>Zhan Xian Tai</strong>. <br/>On Zhan Xian Tai, there is a tree. <br/>** <em>Literal name “Deity Executing Stage”</em></p>
<p>It’s not strange to have trees on high mountains. However, it’s eerie that there’s only one single half-dead ancient tree on such a large mountain, which is otherwise barren.</p>
<p>The villagers of Juefeng Village at the foot of the peak are used to it, although it was lush green here twenty years ago, as far as the eyes could see.</p>
<p>The old people in the village often say that it’s called the “Lone Mountain Nurturing Immortal Tree.” The ancient tree has become a spirit and ascended to immortality. As an immortal tree, how could it coexist with ordinary grass and trees? Naturally, it occupies a mountain peak alone.</p>
<p>There’s a solid reason to call that half-dead, nameless wilted tree a divine tree. Twenty years ago, many disciples from many unknown sects came to Jue Mountain to investigate.</p>
<p>According to the elders, they came with the intention to destroy that old tree. Unfortunately even those mighty and powerful, ended up fleeing with serious injuries. Since then, no one has dared to attempt to destroy that tree.</p>
<p>After that Jue Mountain became spookier, perpetually covered in fog. Villagers occasionally get lost in the barren mountain, wandering at the foot of the mountain for hours.</p>
<p>Such a sinister place deters people.</p>
<p>However, lately there seems to be a group of people who are undeterred and come every year. Although they can’t ascend the mountain, they would hire some villagers to bury black iron boxes they bring at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>Those boxes are extremely strange, like iron but not iron, with a surface covered in sticky black ooze that moves slowly, as if it would melt into a puddle of black water at any moment.</p>
<p>When these were being buried, the men in black prohibit villagers from touching the boxes with their hands, and they can only use specially made iron forks to push the boxes into the pit. Wu Lao San from the east of the village once accidentally touched one of those boxes with his hand, and his entire palm was eroded away, earning him the nickname “Wu One-Hand.”</p>
<p>This job is fraught with endless danger, and even though the pay is generous, villagers are unwilling to do it.</p>
<p>But there was always some people who seem like their souls had been snatched, being driven up the mountain in a daze.</p>
<p>The villagers suspect they are under some sort of spell. Whenever this happens, people hide in their homes, afraid to go to the fields to work, lest their strong men be caught by these evil forces.</p>
<p>Even so, some unsuspecting travelers from other places are still captured to carry the boxes.</p>
<p>As a result, the divine tree’s reputation couldn’t help but be tainted, and people started to call it an ominous object that caused Jue Mountain to become a land of evil spirits.</p>
<p>If children misbehaved, they can be threatened with ” If you throw any more tantrums, will leave you on Jue Mountain!” Upon hearing this, even the most stubborn children are frightened into silence, hiding under their blankets.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:18px"></div>
<p>Although the village is somewhat poor, everyone is strong and healthy, with many elderly. In contrast, the sickly girl from Carpenter Xue’s family in the east of the village seems out of place compared to children her age.</p>
<p>The Xue couple had been married for many years without any children and finally had a daughter fifteen years ago. She turned out to be a sickly child who seemed like a slightly strong wind might break her waist.</p>
<p>The couple cherished this only daughter like the apple of their eye, reluctant to let her go outside.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:19px"></div>
<p>Xue’s wife, Qiao Lian, is making pickled radishes. She looks up to see her daughter, Ran Ran, standing on tiptoe looking over the courtyard wall, seemingly watching the rowdy children. She goes over and says, “Good girl, those are just a bunch of wild boys outside and may knock into you…if you want to go out to play, how about we get your dad to take you by the river?”</p>
<p>Xue Ran Ran reluctantly withdrew her gaze, swallowed silently, and obediently replied with a pair of eyes clear as an autumn lake, “Mother, I’m not a child anymore. I don’t want to go out and play.”</p>
<p>Qiao Lian looked over the short wall and immediately understood once she saw the chubby boy from the Ding family holding a Flower Jujube Puff in his hand.</p>
<p>Her Ran Ran is well-behaved and obedient, just born with a fondness for food. She is always munching on snacks. If she sees some seasonal delicacies, her big eyes can stare at them for hours on end.</p>
<p>That chubby boy is holding the delicate pastry that only rich families have, and Ran Ran was craving for it.</p>
<p>Qiao Lian felt a little sorry and could only say, “Good girl, that pastry is only sold in the county town. When your father finishes his work for Mr. Ding and earns some money, he will buy for you to eat.”</p>
<p>By this time, Ran Ran had already sat back down on her stool. She tugged on her hair bun she just combed and sensibly said, “Mother, isn’t that very expensive? I already caught the scent just now, they added cotton sugar to jujubes, wrapped in pork lard kneaded dough, baked with a medium fire for six minutes. When autumn comes and we harvest the jujubes, Mother can buy a small packet of cotton sugar, and I can make it too.”</p>
<p>Qiao Lian smiled and pinched her face: “Do you really have a puppy’s nose? You can tell how its made just by smelling it? Who told you the recipe, are you trying to fool your mother?”</p>
<p>Seeing that her mother did not believe her, Ran ran didn’t speak anymore. She smiled and went to help her mother pack the radishes into the jar. She pinched a piece of radish and said while biting into it, “Didn’t Father cut a piece of smoked duck meat yesterday? Let’s have radish stewed with smoked duck tonight?”</p>
<p>Qiao Lian snatched the piece of radish from her hand and said, “You can’t be greedy and eat it raw. You have a weak stomach. Be careful not to upset your stomach, or you won’t be able to eat the duck meat tonight.”</p>
<p>People wonder why this couple, who are strong and healthy, gave birth to a sick child. Only Qiao Lian knows the truth, that Ran Ran was found by her under the withered tree in Jue Mountain sixteen years ago.</p>
<p>That day, she didn’t know why, but she had woken from her afternoon nap with a tightness in her chest, so she went up the mountain for a walk. In the rolling fog, she somehow reached the top of the mountain and heard a baby’s cry from afar.</p>
<p>A small white bundle was huddled under the tree, with big eyes half open, filled with tears, crying pitifully. Qiao Lian’s heart was broken by its cries.</p>
<p>She didn’t know who could be so cruel to abandon such a cute and round little baby under the divine tree. But Qiao Lian felt it was a blessing from the heavens, who took pity on the childless couple and gifted them with a daughter.</p>
<p>Xue Lian Gui also agreed with his wife and was overjoyed with the baby girl his wife brought home. Only later did they discover that the baby was born with a frail constitution, frequently falling ill or falling into deep sleep, unable to open her eyes. The couple sought help from many doctors nearby and spent a lot of money on medicine, but there was no improvement.</p>
<p>As time went by, the couple became experienced in caring for a sick child and managed to raise the frail Ran Ran to her current age. Their delicate seedling finally managed to grow this big.</p>
<p>When the baby was found, there was a red birthmark on the palm of her right hand. Xue the carpenter asked the village scholar and learned that the pattern looked like the character “Ran,” so they simply named her Xue Ran Ran.</p>
<p>However, when Ran Ran turned one year old, the birthmark on her palm slowly faded away and disappeared.</p>
<p>Many children’s birthmarks fade as they grow older. The carpenter couple didn’t pay much attention to it and focused on earning money to raise their daughter. Their modest life was still filled with lots of joy.</p>
<p>While the mother and daughter were talking, someone shouted from outside the low wall: “Auntie, I bought some pastries specially, can Ran Ran try a piece??”</p>
<p>Qiao Lian turned her head and saw that it was the elder brother of the chubby boy who was eating the pastry, the second son of Ding family.</p>
<p>The Ding family is a wealthy family in the village. Their second son is studying in the town’s academy, soon to take the imperial exam, with a promising future. He is also engaged to the daughter of a successful exam graduate in the county, but he frequently returns to the village to flirt with her Ran Ran.</p>
<p>Qiao Lian knew that her daughter, although frail, had a beautiful face with delicate eyebrows and snow-white skin, standing out among the fifteen or sixteen-year-old girls in the village.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, her frail and delicate figure was not appealing to the traditional rural families. If a farming family in the village were looking for a daughter-in-law, they probably wouldn’t choose Ran Ran, who couldn’t do heavy work.</p>
<p>However, Young Master Ding, having read a few books, had a different perspective from the farmers. Like an annoying fly that won’t leave, he had been watching Ran Ran closely for the past year.</p>
<p>He even asked the village matchmaker to convey his intentions, implying that after he got married, he would bring Ran Ran into his home as a concubine.</p>
<p>Qiao Lian immediately refused, telling the matchmaker to pass the message to Young Master Ding that her daughter Ran Ran had no desire to marry into a wealthy family and asked him to choose someone else.</p>
<p>But this Young Master Ding would always bring food back to the village to tempt Ran Ran.</p>
<p>Fortunately, although her daughter was fond of food, she was not a shallow girl and would keep her distance from him.</p>
<p>So when Young Master Ding called out from across the wall, he only received a cold stare from Auntie Xue and saw Qiao Lian taking Ran Ran back into the house, to cook their meal.</p>
<p>Young Master Ding left in disappointment, carrying his cakes.</p>
<p>That day, Xue the carpenter, who had gone out to make furniture for someone, came back very late. As soon as he entered, he anxiously closed and bolted the courtyard door, then pulled Qiao Lian, who had opened the door for him, into the house. After checking on their daughter sleeping in the small room, he pulled his wife into their own room and asked in a low voice, “Do you remember what day it was when we brought Ran Ran back?”</p>
<p>Qiao Lian blinked and hesitated, “You said you wanted to treat her as your own daughter, so to avoid the villagers gossiping and the child feeling sad about her origins in the future, you had me return to my parents’ home to pretend to be pregnant. Then, more than a year later, we brought the girl back to the village and reduced her age by a full year. So the day we found Ran Ran… should be her birthday pushed back sixteen years and ten months, which is the ninth day of the ninth month in the Qinggeng year.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Xue the carpenter slapped his thigh and lowered his voice even more, “I had a vague feeling it should be this month… Do you know? The black-robed men who came this time went from village to village nearby, asking if anyone had seen a child on Xiantai Mountain in the Qinggeng year in September.”</p>
<p>Qiao Lian’s eyes widened in alarm, and she couldn’t help but pace anxiously, “Is this… is this Ran Ran’s biological parents or relatives coming to take her away?”</p>
<p>Xue the carpenter was also worried about this, so when he heard the news while working as a carpenter at the wealthy Master Ding’s house, he rushed back home without even settling his wages.</p>
<p>When it comes to their children, mothers are usually more decisive.</p>
<p>Qiao Lian quickly calmed down and said firmly, “She’s not a cat or a dog. They think they can abandon her and then take her back whenever they want? How cold is it on the mountain in September! Such a small child, without even a swaddle, was just abandoned under the tree. I think only animals could do such a thing! Our family may not be rich or noble, but we love our daughter like a treasure. She is my life! If anyone wants her, they’ll have to kill me first!”</p>
<p>Earlier, Carpenter Xue’s mind was in turmoil, the kind-hearted man that he was, he thought that if the child’s biological parents really came to claim her, wouldn’t it be cutting off Ran Ran’s ties with her relatives if he didn’t give her up?</p>
<p>But now, hearing his wife’s words, he also felt there was reason in them. The couple had struggled for sixteen years to raise their daughter, how could they just give her up because someone else demanded it? Just thinking about his daughter getting married in a few years made Carpenter Xue’s heart ache and his eyes tear up.</p>
<p>After this, the couple returned to the small room and looked at their daughter sleeping on the bed.</p>
<p>In a few days, she would be seventeen years old. Her delicate face was sleeping sweetly, and they didn’t know what she was dreaming about, but she was smiling with the corners of her mouth curled up…</p>

<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>The couple didn’t know that this unfounded trouble had already been brewing a few days ago.</p>
<p>The people in black searching the village, are disciples of the demonic cultivator Wei Jiu. They are also the group that came to Jue Mountain every year to bury those iron boxes.</p>
<p>Just two days ago, several black-clothed disciples stood respectfully at the foot of the mountain and reported to a beautiful woman in a black gauze and gold-embroidered long skirt.<br/> “Elder Tu, the entire Jue Mountain seems to be surrounded by some spiritual force. We circled around the mountain and couldn’t enter at all.”</p>
<p>The woman in black gauze narrowed her eyes slightly, “You are not here for the first time. Just hire some villagers to go in. They don’t have spiritual roots and won’t be blocked by the spiritual barrier. Plus, with the Soul Capturing Spell making them lose their senses, they can at least reach halfway up the mountain.”</p>
<p>The lead disciple replied tensely, “This disciple did exactly as instructed, but… in the past, those people only needed to bury the boxes filled with resentment water at the foot of the mountain and didn’t need to go up. But now, after they enter the mountain, they seem to encounter a ghost wall and have been wandering in the mist for the whole day, just circling at the foot of the mountain and are unable to go up at all!”</p>
<p>This woman in black gauze, named Tu Jiu Yuan, was an Elder under Wei Jiu. Hearing this, she suddenly waved her sleeve and the chilling wind knocked more than a dozen disciples to the ground, “A bunch of fools! This is the year the Rebirth Tree will bear fruit. Twenty years ago, Mu Qingge’s was destroyed and a wisp of her scattered soul was lodged in the tree. If there is not enough resentment water to irrigate the roots, the fruit that is grown may end up a useless being. Our revered Master is currently at the stage of **Yuan Ying transforming into a divine being, urgently needing the aid of the reborn Mu Qingge. We must ensure that the Rebirth Tree will bear spiritual fruit that is up to standard!”<br/><br/><em>** Yuan Ying is from Taoist cultivation concept, Nascent Soul. </em><br/>“<em>Cultivators form a new untouched soul which must ascend to the heavens facing heavenly tribulation at each step.”</em></p>
<p>While she spoke, the disciples who were knocked away seemed to be suspended in mid-air by some invisible force, their eyes bulging as they let out painful howls.</p>
<p>Tu Jiu Yuan clenched her fist and a black mist suddenly rose. With a fierce pull, she seemed to have extracted some energy from those disciples. The men fell to the ground as if they had been skinned and deboned.</p>
<p>“I have used the Bone Sacrifice Spell to strip all your spiritual energy, so you can go in and investigate without hindrance. Even without spiritual roots, the compass made of dragon bones is enough to break through the Smokescreen Spell to reach the mountaintop. I believe you can handle it better than those villagers. Once the boxes are buried, I have the means to restore your spiritual energy.”</p>
<p>These nonchalant words were really just to fool the newcomers of the Sect.</p>
<p>The Bone Sacrifice Spell is the most vicious punishment for disciples who violate the sect rules. It has been unheard of, for anyone who has been stripped of their spiritual roots to be restored after.</p>
<p>Even the female demonic cultivator Mu Qingge, who once caused chaos in the immortal cultivation world, became powerless to fight back after being hit by the Ninefold Bone Sacrifice Curse.</p>
<p>Since Mu Qingge’s demise, the top demonic cultivator is their revered Master Wei Jiu of their Crimson Gate , whose cultivation far exceeds that of Mu Qingge back then.</p>
<p>It’s too bad that the rebirth of the once all-powerful witch Mu Qingge, will merely be as a ginseng fruit to boost their master’s cultivation.<br/><br/>**人参果<em> is a legendary mythical fruit</em></p>
<p>However, it’s obvious that not only the Crimson Gate covets this ginseng fruit. Even the righteous sects that claim to be orthodox have sent people to set up a spiritual shield on the mountain, forbidding others from encroaching the Rebirth Tree.</p>
<p>After the soul has scattered, the person reborn from the Rebirth Tree will be as reincarnated, unrelated to the past, neither righteous or evil. It will be easy to teach and nurture.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge had a naturally extreme yin spirit demonic physique, with strong spiritual power embedded in her soul.</p>
<p>Many famous orthodox sects, even as they do not openly declare it, have the intention to obtain this spiritual child of the immortal tree, to raise from a young age, and used for their own purposes.</p>
<p>After all, the heavenly lightning tribulation that occurs once every three hundred years is approaching, and many powerful cultivators who are almost able to ascend need talented disciples to help them overcome the tribulation trial.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge’s reborn body is just right for this purpose.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Tu Jiu Yuan’s heart felt much more at ease.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge and her were once fellow disciples. Seeing their Master favor Mu Qingge, allowing only her to learn the true teachings and form her golden core early on, while she was always inferior to this junior in every way. Tu Jiu Yuan had always been tormented by jealousy.</p>
<p>But now, Mu Qingge is just a fruit on a tree. When the fruit ripens and falls, it will just be the beginning of her tragic rebirth…</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Tu Jiu Yuan broke into a sinister smile.</p>
<p>She took a few strands of hair that she had just pulled from the heads of those disciples, put them into a small bronze censer in her hand, and silently recited a spell. In no time, she was able to connect with those disciples who went up the mountain, replacing her own sensory input with theirs.</p>
<p>Sacrificing a few disciples was indeed beneficial, indeed much more useful than those villagers.</p>
<p>Maybe the spiritual shield had been set up for too long. This time she was able to control the puppet-like disciples to reach the mountaintop without any resistance, and she could clearly see everything on the mountain through their eyes.</p>
<p>However she was stunned when she saw the weathered fragments under the tree – could it be that the Spirit fruit had fallen long ago?</p>
<p>She made the disciples on the mountain lift their heads and saw a large fruit hanging on the tree, which reassured her a bit.</p>
<p>Just then, a gust of wind blew by and her scalp tightened. In the blink of an eye, someone had pulled a few strands of her hair.</p>
<p>The next moment, Tu Jiu Yuan also lost her senses and came under the control of another.</p>
<p>The remaining disciples respectfully knelt down and shouted in unison, “Long live our Revered Master!”</p>
<p>A man in a black robe had arrived. Although he had a somewhat feminine appearance, his tall stature and the coldness in his narrow phoenix eyes made him unmistakably a man full of murderous intent.</p>
<p>He is Wei Jiu, the Revered Master of the Crimson Gate.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu slowly twirled the strands of Elder Tu’s hair around his long fingers, already having a clear view of the situation on the mountain. He directed the disciples on the mountain to pick up the fruit shell fragments and used a Retrospection Spell to deduce that the fruit had fallen in the Qing Geng year.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu curled his thin lips, snapped his fingers to burn the broken hair at his fingertips and coldly ordered, “Send people down the mountain to search. Find all the children born in the Qing Geng year for me!”</p>
<p>At this time, Tu Jiu Yuan’s senses returned and she hurriedly knelt down and saluted, “Revered Master, could the spiritual child from the prematurely fallen Rebirth Fruit already be gone from the vicinity of Jue Mountain?”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu narrowed his eyes coldly and sneered, “The premature falling of the Rebirth Fruit has already posed a great risk. If the spiritual child is too far from the Rebirth Tree, there’s no chance of survival. She must be nearby. Search thoroughly!”</p>
<p>With numerous disciples and vast influence of the Crimson Gate, an order from the Revered Master led to a thorough search of the nearby villages and towns.</p>
<p>However, despite finding several boys and girls of the appropriate age, none of them possessed the aura of the Rebirth Tree’s spiritual power.</p>
<p>After hearing the report from his disciples, Wei Jiu turned his gaze back to the mountaintop of Jue Mountain, where another fruit was still rapidly growing on the tree, seemingly about to ripen soon.</p>
<p>He was also present during that battle back then, and was well aware that Mu Qingge’s sister, Mu Ran wu, had also perished together with her.</p>
<p>It made sense that two souls had entered the tree and resulted in two fruits.</p>
<p>Now that one fruit had fallen too early… although Mu Ranwu with her mediocre talent was more likely to have fallen first, Wei Jiu felt that a thorough investigation was necessary to avoid any future troubles.</p>
<p>“Mu Qingge…” Wei Jiu softly uttered the name, his eyes filled with a determined and sinister gleam.</p>
<p>He practiced a demonic path that involved devouring souls and craving spirits, which amplified his innate greed. Wei Jiu was obsessed with Mu Qingge, whom he had always coveted but never obtained.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, a bloodthirsty red light flickered in Wei Jiu’s eyes, and his originally noble appearance became terrifying to behold.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Qiao Lian and her husband had made their decision. They planned to stay at home for the next few days, waiting for the unorthodox disciples and their people to leave before their next move.</p>
<p>Fortunately, they had been cautious and hadn’t immediately brought the child back to the village when they found her. So, when someone did come knocking, they stuck to the story they had told the other villagers, giving a fake birth date for their daughter. Since they had delayed her age by a year, the records clearly did not match the Qing Geng year. The villagers could all testify, leaving no loose ends.</p>
<p>When the black-clothed men burst into the courtyard and saw the frail and sickly daughter of the Xue family, they couldn’t be bothered to take a second look.</p>
<p>After all, this little girl had no aura of spiritual wisdom and seemed a mere ordinary mortal who was not even qualified to enter the path of cultivation, let alone be the spiritual child reborn from the Rebirth Tree!</p>
<p>After that one visit, no one else came knocking.</p>
<p>Although they had delayed their daughter’s birth year by one year, Ranran had always been frail and appeared smaller than children of her age, so no one ever suspected anything.</p>
<p>However, in the village, five children born in the year of Qing Geng were said to have had their fingers cut by the black-clothed disciples, and their blood was dripped into a black incense burner.</p>
<p>After carpenter Xue found out about this, he turned pale. His daughter Ranran was delicate and weak, and if she were really cut with a knife, it would take her at least ten days to half a month to recover.</p>
<p>Later, that group of black-robed disciples, stubbornly determined, took away all the children born in the year of Qing geng from the surrounding villages.</p>
<p>Although they claimed to be checking for spiritual roots, this act of kidnapping without any trace of the victims was utterly lawless.</p>
<p>Some people resisted fiercely, but in the end, they were beaten half to death by the powerful demonic cultivator disciples and could only watch helplessly as their children were taken away.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t understand why her parents had been very listless the past few days, with her mother even lying in bed for two days like she had been traumatized. But as a daughter, she felt it was her duty to show filial piety when her mother was ill.</p>
<p>Ranran asked her father to help heat up the stove, and she made sesame sweet potato cakes that she had seen before. After they were steaming hot from the oven, Ranran placed them on a small table for her parents to eat.</p>
<p>Qiao Lian was amazed at the delicate cakes her daughter made and asked where she had learned to do so. She was full of praise as she asked her.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t know either. She just nibbled on the cake contentedly and mumbled, “I knew how to make it after eating it once. Mother, do you think I starved to death in my past life? Is that why I always think about food?”</p>
<p>Qiao Lian spat once on the ground forcefully, “Tsk tsk, what’s a little girl like you saying about life and death in this way? I think you just died of gluttony in your past life!”</p>
<p>After saying that, she paused, realizing she herself had mentioned about life and death, while her clever daughter laughed out loud and took a big bite to satisfy her craving.</p>
<p>Qiao Lian laughed along with her daughter and the tension of the past few days eased—the black-robed people hadn’t been coming to the village much these days, so they are probably in the clear.</p>
<p>Qiao Lian and her husband decided that after the winter, they would put together some money and return to their old home in He Ning, far away from this troubled place.</p>

<p>After Qiao Lian made this decision, the family began to prepare for their trip.</p>
<p>Just at sunset, at the top of Jue Mountain, someone was quietly gazing at the village below, where smoke was curling up from the chimneys.</p>
<p>The person was tall, with a posture like a sturdy pine tree, wrapped in a rather worn green robe, looking somewhat desolate. His long loose hair, half-concealed his face. But his features were indistinct as if covered by a layer of pale false skin, creating an eerie appearance.</p>
<p>Although Jue Mountain was protected by a spiritual shield, for some reason, it did not stop this person and his two followers from reaching the top of the mountain, unobstructed the entire way.</p>
<p>The man standing behind him, with the eyes of a leopard and the waist of a bear, is named Yu Chen.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yu Chen had been accompanying his master in the cold wind for an hour. He tried to hold back but finally couldn’t help but cautiously remind him, “Master, should we report this matter to the other sects?”</p>
<p>The “matter” he referred to was the fact that the Rebirth Tree had already borne a spiritual fruit, but the fruit had fallen to the ground at an unknown time, leaving only fragments of the fruit shell.</p>
<p>This tree had grown for ten thousand years. In the past, his master, Su Yishui, had sacrificed his blood to consecrate it, giving up half of his cultivation that formed his Golden Core, just to allow this tree to accept the remnant soul and transform nothingness into a physical body.</p>
<p>Yu Chen didn’t quite understand his master’s self-harming behavior. Since his master had done all these just to enable the notorious female demonic cultivator, Mu Qingge, to be reborn!</p>
<p>Even though Su Yishui had once been a disciple of Mu Qingge, it was the female demon Mu Qingge who coveted Su Yishui’s outstanding appearance and forcibly persuaded him, who was originally a disciple of Mount Shu, to switch to her side. She also forced him to cultivate the demonic path.</p>
<p>He thought of his master, who before embarking on the path to cultivate immortality, had been the illegitimate son of the then-powerful Prince Ping. Although he couldn’t be included in the ancestral genealogy, he was raised in luxury since he was the son of Prince Ping’s beloved woman. How could he be ordered around by a woman?</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, after the Young Master decided to cultivate immortality and sever worldly ties at the age of sixteen, this flower youth fell into the hands of the notorious female demon.</p>
<p>Fortunately, his Master was a genius with extraordinary talent. Even though his cultivation was not as high as Mu Qingge’s, he later surpassed her and even defected from her sect to assist the righteous path in killing this evil female demon.</p>
<p>Back then, Mu Qingge was attacked simultaneously by the three major immortal cultivation sects and hit by the Ninefold Bone Sacrifice Curse, leaving her with no chance to fight back. In the end, her spiritual roots were stripped away, her spiritual power dispersed, and she met a tragic end with the scattering of her shattered soul .</p>
<p>If it weren’t for his Master’s mercy, attaching a trace of her remnant soul to the Rebirth Tree, the world might never see the demonic cultivator Mu Qingge ever again.</p>
<p>However that despicable woman, before dying, managed to cast a curse on his Master, that damn Melting Face Curse! It sealed the celestial appearance of Su Yishui, forcing him to cover his face with a veil from then on.</p>
<p>Even in her dying moments, she played a prank like a mischievous child, fully showing the wickedness of that female demon!</p>
<p>Perhaps due to the Melting Face Curse, whenever his Master occasionally showed his true face, it always led to exclamations or ridicule. In the years that followed, he spoke less and less, and unless he was building training alchemy, he spent most of his time like the present, standing silently before empty mountains and the wilderness.</p>
<p>That gentle and warm-hearted young man in his memory seemed to have changed into a different person after Mu Qingge was executed, becoming so deadly silent that it was frightening.</p>
<p>Perhaps his Master was so persistent in ensuring this female demon would be reborn in order to break this annoying curse?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>However, when Yu Chen and his sister Yu Tong accompanied the Master to Jue Mountain seventeen years ago, they found that the tree had suddenly borne fruit. Unfortunately at that time, the three major sects had sent people to destroy the Rebirth Tree once again. The Master stopped them and battled fiercely with several powerful cultivators.</p>
<p>Because he had spent much of his core to help Mu Qingge’s rebirth, Su Yishui had been greatly weakened. However, his bold stance of being ready to shatter his soul and perish with everyone, made it difficult for them to withstand his attacks.</p>
<p>After all, everyone knew that the three major sects were able to win back then thanks to Su Yishui’s significant contributions. If he were to die at the hands of the three major sects, the reputation of the righteous path would be ruined for turning on their benefactor.</p>
<p>In the end, those powerful cultivators were really annoyed by Su Yishui’s persistent fighting. Seeing his once charming appearance now indistinct, they felt pity and decided to make a concession. They generously made an agreement with Su Yishui to allow Mu Qingge to be reborn on the tree, so that Su Yishui could break his curse.</p>
<p>But the three major sects made it clear that after the curse was lifted, Mu Qingge’s life and death would no longer be up to Su Yishui to decide.</p>
<p>After that, Jue Mountain has been placed under a Barrier Spell and no one is allowed to approach. They will just wait ten years until the Rebirth Fruit ripens and falls.</p>
<p>However, because the tree was once watered with Su Yishui’s golden core and spiritual blood, even though there is a spiritual shield, it can only block people with ulterior motives and cannot prevent Su Yishui from going up the mountain.</p>
<p>But in these long years, Su Yishui had never returned. It was only today, when they passed by this place and suddenly found that the spiritual shield had been weakened, as if someone had broken in, that they came up the mountain to take a look.</p>
<p>What they found was shocking! The Yu siblings discovered that the Rebirth Tree had lost its fruit some time ago, and the whereabouts of the reincarnated female demon were unknown. If the reborn Mu Qingge remains unchanged in her demonic nature and is not restrained, wouldn’t it cause chaos in the world once again?</p>
<p>At this moment, Su Yishui, who had been standing on the mountain for a long while, finally uttered a few words: “There is still one more…”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Yu Chen looked back and was astonished to find that the tree, which was somewhat bald, indeed still had another fruit.</p>
<p>He couldn’t help but rub his eyes and found that the fruit was hidden behind a few wilted leaves. Maybe he hadn’t looked carefully before, which was why he hadn’t noticed?</p>
<p>But the branch that bore the fruit was clearly different from ten years ago! Could it be… that the tree bore two fruits?</p>
<p>The woman who had been standing silently beside him was Yu Chen’s younger sister, Yu Tong, who had also been following and serving Su Yishui.</p>
<p>Seeing this situation, Yu Tong tentatively said, “Back then, Mu Qingge was extremely evil, but her fellow disciple and younger sister Mu Ranwu was a kind and pure person, completely opposite to her sister in character. Unfortunately, such a good person couldn’t escape Mu Qingge’s clutches and perished together with her in the battle on Jue Mountain…”</p>
<p>At this point, Yu Tong paused, as if she suddenly thought of something, “At that time, Mu Ranwu assisted the three major sects, trying to use the Soul-Devouring Lock to lock Mu Qingge’s soul. Unfortunately, she was countered by Mu Qingge and pulled into the Soul-Devouring Lock. Could it be that their remnant souls became entangled and were both reborn on the Rebirth Tree, resulting in two fruits?”</p>
<p>Yu Tong was young at the time and had not yet built her foundation, so her impression of Mu Ranwu was really scant. Although Mu Ranwu was good-natured, compared to her sister, who was highly talented and exceptionally beautiful, Mu Ranwu was so ordinary that people couldn’t even recall her appearance.</p>
<p>What’s baffling is, if the tree had borne two fruits, which one of them was the first to fall to the ground and be reborn, Mu Ranwu or Mu Qingge?</p>
<p>When Yu Chen raised this question, Su Yishui, who had been standing in the wind, still did not speak.</p>
<p>But Yu Tong, with her lips tightly pressed, said indignantly, “Haven’t you seen a cuckoo bird occupy the nest of other birds? Once the cuckoo chick hatches, it will push the original owner’s eggs out of the nest. The Rebirth Tree’s spiritual power is limited. If there are two fruits, the spiritual power would be divided. Naturally, the weaker one has been forced out.”</p>
<p>Seventeen years ago, Yu Tong had accompanied her Master to Jue Mountain. At that time, the fallen fruit grew on the western branch of the tree. But now, the fruit on the western branch is gone, and the almost invisible fruit on the eastern branch has suddenly grown much larger.</p>
<p>It’s obvious that Mu Qingge edged out her younger sister’s remnant soul and monopolized the spiritual tree. After all, Mu Ranwu, in terms of talent or spiritual root, was far inferior to her sister Mu Qingge.</p>
<p>Poor Mu Ranwu, falling before her time, probably didn’t even form a physical body and just dissipated in the wind.</p>
<p>Thinking of Mu Ranwu’s simple and kind appearance, Yu Tong felt saddened.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But at this moment, Su Yishui, who had been standing silently for a long time and rarely uttered a long sentence, said “Lingxi Palace has not accepted disciples for a long time. You two, go to the nearby villages and gather some disciples.”</p>
<p>The Yu siblings were taken aback. Lingxi Palace was the sect founded by the female demon Mu Qingge. Conditions for acceptance into the sect did not consider the quality of one’s spiritual roots but only accepted orphans based on their appearance, whether male or female. Such rules clearly exposed the true nature of a lustful demon.</p>
<p>And her recruiting of a disciple with outstanding talent like Su Yishui was purely a fluke, like a blind cat stumbling upon a dead rat.</p>
<p>After the female demon was executed, the notorious Lingxi Palace also fell into decline.</p>
<p>However, the female demon did leave behind a considerable amount of gold and silver for her orphaned disciples. Since most of them had no demonic cultivation and the three major sects prided themselves on being righteous, they did not want to execute them along with their master, which would tarnish the reputation of the righteous path. Thus, they let them leave with the money and fend for themselves.</p>
<p>But now, Su Yishui intended to reopen Lingxi Palace and accept disciples under its name, which really puzzled the Yu siblings.</p>
<p>However, Su Yishui was unwilling to explain further. With a light tap of his toes, his green robe fluttered as he quickly descended the mountain from the other side, and the Yu siblings hurriedly followed their master on the wind.</p>
<p>While it was turbulent on the mountain in recent days, the village below remained peaceful, with people continuing their daily routine of working at sunrise and resting at sunset.</p>
<p>After deciding to move, Qiao Lian began to arrange for the long-term lease of their few acres of land.</p>
<p>The houses in the village were not valuable, so it was better to keep their house for now and see if they wanted to return after the things return to normal.</p>
<p>But at this time, an unexpected complication arose.</p>
<p>When Carpenter Xue went to settle his wages at Master Ding’s home, Ding’s wife had nitpicked his craftsmanship, claiming that the table he made had cracked and refused to pay him.</p>
<p>As Ding’s second son was about to get married, Xue Lian Gui had worked for more than a month on a complete set of furniture for them, but now they refused to pay him. Now, they may find it difficult to buy daily necessities, let alone afford to start their long journey.</p>
<p>Carpenter Xue is a tough man. He had told Master Ding from the beginning that the wood for the table was not of good quality, being damp and likely to crack if used for furniture.</p>
<p>But Master Ding had insisted on saving money on wood costs and refused to replace it.</p>
<p>Xue Liangui had no choice but to follow the homeowner’s orders and complete the carpentry work, only for Ding’s wife to turn around and deny responsibility, even instructing their servant to slap him twice.</p>
<p>In fact, Ding’s wife did this on purpose. Her second son had a bright and promising future and had finally attached himself to a prestigious family in the county. But he was bewitched by the frail Xue Ranran and constantly mumbled on about taking her as a concubine in future.</p>
<p>If the scholar’s daughter knew about this, wouldn’t she be furious enough to call off their marriage?</p>
<p>Ding’s wife felt that her second son had lost his senses because of the sickly Xue Ranran’s slender waist, so she decided to teach the Xue family a lesson, letting them know that it won’t be easy to enter the threshold of a wealthy family. She hoped the little vixen would give up soon and stop trying to seduce her son, so she found fault with his work and deny him his wages. She even took the opportunity to teach Carpenter Xue a lesson.</p>
<p>Qiao Lian was so angry that her cheeks turned red and she cursed, “Blast it, they are so unscrupulous! No wonder no one was willing to take on work at their house.”</p>

<p>Xue Liangui was also coming to his senses at this time, realizing that the willow wood table was not fit to be shown. The furniture used for Ding’s family wedding was all made of high-quality mahogany, except for that table, which looked like it was meant for the servants, yet they made a big fuss about it.</p>
<p>How could it be that the servants having no table to eat at, would delay their son’s wedding?</p>
<p>It was obvious that the Ding family had set a trap, intending to default on the payment from the start. The carpenter regretted deeply, even his daughter Ranran had advised him not to take up the job, but he was tempted by the high wages offered by the Ding family and ended up taking this disgusting task.</p>
<p>Ranran had been listening by their side and saw her parents’ indignation. She comforted Xue Liangui, saying, “Father, it’s not worth arguing with such wicked people like the Ding family. Just consider it as making a free set of funeral furniture for them.”</p>
<p>However, the carpenter couple are obviously not listening to their daughter’s gentle persuasion.</p>
<p>Qiao Lian is a feisty woman, how could she tolerate her man being wronged like this?</p>
<p>Seeing their nearly empty rice bin at home, she couldn’t hold back any longer. She put down the cooking spoon, hurriedly untied her apron and went to the village chief’s house. She wanted to ask the village chief to accompany her to the Ding family’s house to argue for their payment.</p>
<p>Xue Liangui, still anxious, told his daughter to eat first and hurried followed Qiao Lian.</p>
<p>Ranran, fearing her parents would get the worst of it, quickly changed into her outer garment and called out towards the yard, “Mother, if you really have to go, please don’t quarrel with them. Just mildly lament about how we have nothing to cook with, heap praise their second son’s good character, and say he will surely pass the provincial examination with flying colors!”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Qiao Lian, in her anger, did not listen to her daughter’s words—she would be crazy to praise that lecherous Ding family’s second son!</p>
<p>By the time Ranran finished changing her clothes, her parents had already left. She hurried out, intending to catch up to them.</p>
<p>But just as she stepped out and looked up, she saw a man in faded green clothing standing in front of her house.</p>
<p>The man was very tall, and the petite Ranran could only look up at him. She realized he was wearing a hat, with a thick veil covering his face completely.</p>
<p>At this moment, the man seemed to be looking down at her as well. A breeze brought a whiff of chrysanthemum fragrance by the fence, blowing the veil slightly, but his face remained unclear.</p>
<p>Ranran froze for a moment before recovering. She was certain he was not from the village and quickly stepped back a few paces, watching him warily.</p>
<p>Clearly, he was waiting for someone, but it was unclear whom he was waiting for.</p>
<p>Just then, Grandmother Huang from next door drove a stout man from her yard by splashing a bucket of swill on him: “Just a few days ago, you came to our village to kidnap people and today you’ve come up with a new scheme to deceive us! Bah! What becoming immortal and achieving eternal life? Everyone in our family is living a long life!”</p>
<p>Yu Chen was unaware that Wei Jiu’s disciples had recently caused trouble in the village. He had been accompanying his master in seclusion in the mountains for cultivation and had not visited the village in a long time. He did not expect people to have become more vicious.</p>
<p>He had just gone in to ask the old lady for some drinking water and casually inquired if there were any young men in the village who wanted to learn the Taoist arts of immortality. Before he could finish speaking, the old lady had already swung her bucket and splashed him with swill.</p>
<p>Regrettably even after years of cultivation, his intellect was rather lacking. Although he silently recited the Water Avoidance Chant, his control was not quite adequate. The sour and rancid slops splashed forcefully into his face.</p>
<p>Even though Yu Chen was well versed in martial skills, but the pride of a martial artist forbade him from beating up ignorant old women from the village. Instead, he could only roar angrily, his eyes widening as he snatched the wooden barrel and smashed it into bits with one strike.</p>
<p>This display of force frightened Grandmother Huang, who quickly closed and locked her door, afraid to curse aloud.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran was also frightened. Just as she turned to return to her yard, a tall and imposing woman with thick brows and bright eyes blocked her way.</p>
<p>She politely greeted Xue Ranran with a fist-and-palm, “Young lady, may we borrow your water bucket so that my elder brother can wash his face?”</p>
<p>Just then, the big man covered in slops also approached, staring at Xue Ranran as if she dared to say half a ‘no,’ he would smash her into pieces like that barrel.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran paused for a moment, and replied with a nod, “The water jar is in the yard, please help yourselves.”</p>
<p>As the big man walked into the yard, Xue Ranran turned and ran. Since villains had entered her home, she had to quickly go to the village head and ask him to organize the young men to drive these people away.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, she had not run a few steps when her legs, as if no longer under her control, automatically moved towards her own yard.</p>
<p>As she entered, the yard gate also closed on its own, seemingly pushed by the wind.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran looked at her legs in disbelief; they had completely disobeyed her, as if possessed…</p>
<p>At this moment, the tall man with the veil was already standing in their yard, seemingly staring at her coldly through the veil.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran felt controlled by a strange force just now, so she was too frightened to move. She then slowly moved along the wall, picking up the wooden stool her father often sat on, and politely offered it to the man, ‘Sir, please have a seat. Let me fetch some hot water for the gentleman to wash his face…’</p>
<p>She then immediately rolled up her sleeves, went into the kitchen, lifted the lid and ladled out some hot water from the large iron pot.</p>
<p>Yu Tong standing by, was quite surprised and raised an eyebrow. Earlier, her Master had cast a spell on the young lady to guide her back into the yard.</p>
<p>Normally, this rural girl should have been screaming in fear, but unexpectedly, she just blinked her big dewy eyes and quickly regained her composure, already politely and attentively buttering up her Master.</p>
<p>Other things aside, this girl may look thin and weak, but her courage was unusual.</p>
<p>While the girl was fetching water, Yu Tong asked, ‘Young lady, how old are you?’</p>
<p>Xue Ranran replied softly, ‘Almost sixteen…’</p>
<p>As the hot water arrived, Yu Chen eagerly washed the slops off his face, while the girl retreated to the side, observing them carefully.</p>
<p>Fortunately, these people were different from the black-clad ones from before; they didn’t force people to cut their hair or hands.</p>
<p>But the big man seemed to have worked up an appetite from the slops; after washing, he started clamoring about being hungry, asking if there was any food in Ranran’s house.</p>
<p>Yu Chen didn’t want to scare the girl, but he wasn’t originally born with the immortal cultivation physique. Back when he served in the army when he was younger, he was chosen by Prince Ping to protect Su Yishui, so he had stayed by the young master’s side ever since.</p>
<p>Later on, he even resolutely brought along his young sister to cultivate immortality with the young master.</p>
<p>Initially, he couldn’t really understand much, and now after twenty years, he had barely learned some superficial knowledge. He was far from the stage of fasting and must have three meals a day regularly.</p>
<p>Since the fierce-looking man is complaining of hunger, Xue Ranran had to bring out the freshly cooked food again, watching as the big man and the noble-looking woman sat down to eat.</p>
<p>But as the aroma of the rice filled the air, Xue Ranran… also got hungry.</p>
<p>She just couldn’t stand hunger; If she was already going to die, she might as well eat to her fill and not go to the underworld with an empty stomach to drink Mengpo soup.</p>
<p>Since she couldn’t go out to look for her parents, letting these two eat all the food would be even more of a loss, right?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Xue Ranran turned and grabbed a pair of chopsticks, filled a bowl of rice and sat down somewhat shyly to eat with them.</p>
<p>The young lady seemed delicate and refined. When their eyes met, she would even smile shyly. But her bamboo chopsticks moved swiftly like flowing clouds and water. There were only a few thin slices of cured meat in the bowl of stir-fried green beans, and all were deftly picked out by the young lady straight into her mouth.</p>
<p>Even Yu Chen can’t beat her; he felt the young lady was being deliberate so he glared at her. Unfortunately, Xue Ranran is always focused when she is eating, once she entered a state of bliss she paid no attention to others.</p>
<p>With Sue Yishui’s cultivation level, he already no longer needed to eat three meals a day. So he didn’t sit at the table. Instead, he stood by the side, looking at the corner of the yard where Dianthus were planted.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the season for Dianthus to bloom, but the ones in the yard were exceptionally vibrant and lush, blooming brightly.</p>
<p>Sue Yishui slowly turned his head and asked, ‘Who planted these flowers?’</p>
<p>Yu Chen looked at the young lady who was eating seriously, and prompted her, <br/>‘Hey, he’s asking you!’</p>
<p>Xue Ranran’s face was buried in the bowl as she mumbled, ‘I planted them…’</p>
<p>Her father worked as a carpenter and strained his eyes, so she specially planted  Dianthus to dry and make tea for her father.</p>
<p>After looking at the splendid flowers for a while, Su Yishui turned and walked towards Xue Ranran.</p>
<p>He slowly squatted down, meeting Xue Ranran’s eyes as she sat on the small stool.</p>
<p>Being looked at like this made it difficult to continue eating. Ranran cutely held her bowl up to the tall man, ‘Sir, would you like to eat?’</p>
<p>She noticed that the man’s hand which received the bowl was very beautiful, with long fingers that seemed emitting a jade-like glow. A man with such beautiful hands, one can only imagine how handsome his face must be, like an immortal banished to the mortal realm…</p>
<p>Just then, a strong gust of wind blew, lifting the man’s veil for a moment. Although it was only a moment, it was enough for Xue Ranran to see his face clearly.</p>
<p>This should be the kind of monster that scares children in nightmares, with indistinguishable features except for a mouth and chin.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran’s body instinctively leaned back, almost falling off the stool. If the strange-faced man hadn’t reached out to hold her, she would have fallen down.</p>
<p>As if not satisfied with scaring the young girl enough, the man actually slowly took off his hat, completely revealing his blurred and terrifying face. He went closer to Ranran, saying, “What, do I look very frightening?”</p>
<p>Ranran knew she should be tactful at this moment and pick some nice words to say, but she moved her greasy little mouth, struggling to find a compliment for a face like this.</p>
<p>However, this can’t stump Xue Ranran. After calming her mind, she picked the least offensive part of his face and said sincerely, “Sir, your chin is smooth and well-defined, and your mouth is so beautiful that one would not bear to blink. You’re far from scary!”</p>
<p>At these words, Yu Chen spat out the rice in his mouth onto his sister Yu Tong’s head. He was deadly loyal to Su Yishui, but even he couldn’t bring himself to utter such flattering and insincere words.</p>
<p>A face sealed by the Melting face curse was indeed terrifying and scary. He and his sister had always been careful to avoid mentioning any topics related to appearances, and Su Yishui rarely showed his true face to others.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, today his Master is acting out of character and used his ruined face to scare a little girl.</p>
<p>And when the girl said those dishonest words, her eyes were so sincere that they seemed to be rippling with clear autumn water, as if it was the truth!</p>
<p>Su Yishui seemed to be pleased by the flattery and releasing his hand, he slowly stood up and said, <br/>“It’s hard to find a confidante in life, and even fewer people who are not afraid of my appearance… Since we are fated, and I’m cultivating in the western mountains, why don’t you follow me and cultivate the way of immortality together…”</p>
<p>Ranran quickly waved her hands in refusal and said, “I was born weak, and I’m just an ordinary person, how can I cultivate such an extraordinary skill?”</p>
<p>The man with the strange face countered unhurriedly, “The weaker the body, the more you need to cultivate the way of immortality to prolong life and maintain youth. Look, don’t my chin and mouth appear very young?”</p>
<p>At this, even Yu Tong was left gaping.</p>
<p>Her Master had always been a man of few words since he was a youth. Even before he was cursed, he maintained a polite yet distant demeanor with others. Even when the female demon had teased him ever so often, her Master never showed the expressive emotions of ordinary youth. But now, seeing him being so talkative with a silly little girl, he didn’t seem like her Master, who is normally aloof and cold as ice!</p>

<p>Xue Ranran did not expect the man with the strange face to actually use her insincere compliments to corner her. Just when she was at a loss for how to turn his offer down, she suddenly heard the sound of knocking at the door.</p>
<p>She heard Qiao Lian urgently shouting outside, “Ranran, open the door quickly!”</p>
<p>Ranran felt relieved now that her parents were home. She hurried to open the door, only to see Qiao Lian crying and supporting the blood-covered Xue Lian gui.</p>
<p>Earlier, she had gone with the village chief to seek justice. Initially, the village chief spoke reasonably, but Ding’s wife hinted that their second son had influence in the county school, which could be helpful for the village chief’s son who was about to enter the school.</p>
<p>Hearing this, the village chief suddenly back-pedaled, saying that the furniture was indeed defective and shouldn’t be paid for. He then made an excuse about his dog giving birth and hurried off.</p>
<p>At this point, Qiao Lian became livid and started arguing with Ding’s wife.</p>
<p>The Ding family, having many relatives, eventually had several burly cousins come over and try to beat Qiao Lian. Xue Lian gui, in order to protect his wife, took a beating again.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Qiao Lian suddenly remembered her daughter’s advice before leaving the house and had an epiphany. She shouted loudly, “Come and see! The parents of Scholar Ding are trying to beat someone to death! What kind of son can such a family raise, and how can he pass the moral examination for the provincial exam?”</p>
<p>Her words finally stopped the Ding family.</p>
<p>After all, Ding’s second son was about to take the exam, and these past few days officials had been coming to the village to inspect the conduct of the candidates. If a life was really lost, wouldn’t it ruin his son’s future?</p>
<p>Master Ding, alarmed by Qiao Lian’s shouting, worried that his wife’s lapse in judgment might jeopardize their son’s prospects, reluctantly threw three strings of coins at Qiao Lian.</p>
<p>Although they got back his owed wages, Xue Lian gui had already been beaten badly.</p>
<p>Qiao Lian was filled with hatred and regret. She hated the entire Ding family for being beasts and regretted not listening to her daughter’s advice earlier. If she had used the Ding family’s weak point to negotiate, how could her husband have been injured?</p>
<p>She cried all the way home while supporting her husband, only to find several menacing figures in her yard upon opening the door, one of whom… didn’t even seem to have eyes or a nose!</p>
<p>Overwhelmed, Qiao Lian’s eyes rolled back and she fainted. Ranran, with only two hands, could hardly support her mother, let alone her father as well, who was so frightened that his legs turned into jelly.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the woman named Yu Tong, came over to help Ranran support her mother and helped them back into the house.</p>
<p>Although Xue Lian gui was terrified, seeing that the three people seemed to have no ill intentions, he calmed down enough to ask his daughter, “Ranran, who are these people?”</p>
<p>Ranran glanced at the man with the strange face who had already put his veil hat on again and let out a sigh of relief. Fearing her father might say the wrong thing, she quickly informed him, “Father, these are immortals who have come to recruit disciples and offer longevity…”</p>
<p>Hearing his daughter say this, Xue Lian gui’s face turned even paler—had those life-shortening lot returned? Could it be that they found out Ranran was also born in the Qing geng year?</p>
<p>Just then, Qiao Lian was revived with some water and was regaining consciousness with some groans. Ranran, fearing her mother might faint again, quickly explained that these immortals were just here to drink water and eat.</p>
<p>Yu Tong felt they had imposed long enough and took out a purse, rummaging through it.</p>
<p>She thought to herself: the meal they just had, the only meat went into that girl’s mouth, and with just simple fare, there was no need to give too much.</p>
<p>After considering for a moment, she finally pinched out a tiny piece of silver, placed it on the table as payment for the meal, and prepared to leave.</p>
<p>The Rebirth Fruit is about to fall soon and it seems that Wei Jiu and his disciples were also lurking around. If the reborn Mu Qingge falls into Wei Jiu’s hands, the Master’s chance to break the curse might be ruined.</p>
<p>So, in the next few days, she needed to find time to guard Jue Mountain and ensure the safety of the spiritual fruit!</p>
<p>Of course, once the Master breaks the curse, Mu Qingge’s life and death would no longer matter. Yu Tong hoped she would drop dead at once and stop harming her Master.</p>
<p>But Su Yishui did not seem to want to leave. Seeing that Xue Lian gui’s leg seemed to be broken, he reached out to set the broken bone and then covered the wound with his hand.</p>
<p>Xue Lian gui, originally in excruciating pain, unexpectedly felt a warm and soothing sensation when the strange man covered the wound with his hand, and in a short while, he felt no pain at all.</p>
<p>Such divine power was indeed something only immortals possessed!</p>
<p>Overjoyed, Xue Lian gui cautiously thanked the strange man. However, Su Yishui merely said mildly, “I have only temporarily numbed your pain. In three days, you will start to feel pain again, but the broken bone has been set. As long as you keep it immobilized and rest sufficiently, it should heal without any major issues.”</p>
<p>Hearing the plight of the Carpenter couple, Yu Chen, who was beside them, became angry and said, “Do you want me to teach those Ding tyrants a lesson?”</p>
<p>Xue Lian gui was already full of regret and quickly waved his hand, saying, “No need. We are planning to move away from here anyway, so it’s better not to make things complicated.”</p>
<p>At this moment, Qiao Lian also gradually woke up. After hearing her daughter’s quiet explanation, she finally calmed down.</p>
<p>To Yu Tong’s complete surprise, Su Yishui, who was usually detached from worldly affairs, seemed very approachable today. With just a few words, he started handing out predictions like a fortune-teller.</p>
<p>After hearing that they were planning to return to their old home in He Ning, Su Yishui bluntly said that their daughter had a ill-fated look and might only have a few days left to live. Only by cultivating some immortal techniques for longevity could she prolong her life.</p>
<p>Normally, the couple would have easily believed such convincing words about the occult.</p>
<p>But with the recent criminals searching for children born in the year of Qing geng, and now this strange-looking person seemed persistent, trying all means to recruit their daughter for a disciple, it didn’t seem like a good thing no matter how they looked at it.</p>
<p>And saying that she only had a few days left? That sounded too bizarre and more like a curse!</p>
<p>So Qiao Lian firmly refused and politely prepared to send them away.</p>
<p>Su Yishui did not say any more, leaving only one sentence: “If you regret it, you can find me at the western mountains in Yongcheng. My name is Su Yishui.”</p>
<p>After saying this, he ethereally led his two followers away and left. If one didn’t look at his face, just his figure from the back was indeed that of a tall and handsome man with broad shoulders and a narrow waist…</p>
<p>Qiao Lian found herself staring at the man’s back, lost in thought, and quickly gathered her wits.</p>
<p>What was wrong with her? Why was she unconsciously staring at that strange-faced man…</p>
<p>As Su Yishui left the Xue family’s home, Yu Tong asked, <br/>“Master, should I stay and guard the Rebirth Tree to prevent any mishaps with the spiritual fruit?”</p>
<p>But Su Yishui replied indifferently, “No need. We have been wandering for too long. It’s time to return…”</p>
<p>However, just as they were about to leave the village, they happened to encounter the carriage of the Dings, also leaving.</p>
<p>Master Ding who just had a dispute with the Xue couple, was forced to pay the carpenter his wages due to concerns about the upcoming provincial examination, and he was now very displeased.</p>
<p>Tonight there was a social gathering in the county town. He was rushing to take his son to the banquet, to curry favor with the officials who had arrived in the county to inspect the candidates’ conduct.</p>
<p>Sitting in the carriage, he scolded his son in a low voice, “A man’s future is most important. At this time, why are you getting involved with that sickly girl from the Xue family? Once you have an official rank, she’s not even worthy of being your maid! A family of shrews. Once this matter is over, I’ll set fire to the Xue family’s house in the middle of the night!”</p>
<p>His son laughed it off, “I was just teasing her casually. Why are you taking it so seriously like Mother? That kind of girl is always trying to get my attention. She’s just a frivolous girl to play with. Don’t get angry, Father. You still have to drink with the examiners later!”</p>
<p>Although Su Yishui was far from the carriage, as an immortal cultivator, his hearing was extraordinary. Despite being a village road apart, he could hear everything clearly.</p>
<p>Yu Tong saw it clearly; her Master lightly lifted his finger and quickly drew a talisman in the air, casting a spell towards the carriage.</p>
<p>It was an entry-level spell for immortal cultivators, called the “Heart and Mouth as One” curse.</p>
<p>The person affected by this curse would not be able to speak falsely for the next six hours; they would only speak the truth from their heart. Hence the name “Heart and Mouth as One.”</p>
<p>The Ding father and son pair were going to meet the examiners, and they would inevitably say some  disingenuous flattery. With this curse, who knows what kind of deadly jokes they would make…</p>
<p>Clearly, the Ding father and son had displeased the Master.</p>
<p>Yu Tong felt bewildered again. Her Master, who usually didn’t like to meddle in other people’s affairs, seemed to be possessed today!</p>
<p>Back at the Xue home, Qiao Lian had initially planned to leave after winter, but now that they had offended the Ding family, it was not advisable to delay their departure.</p>
<p>Although they only gotten back three strings of coins, if they were frugal, sell some wooden barrels and stools along the way and take on some carpentry odd jobs would be enough.</p>
<p>So Qiao Lian prepared the food and dried goods for the journey, packed a few simple bags. Xue Lian gui loaded his carpentry tools onto the donkey cart and locked the yard door with a strong lock, they hurriedly set off.</p>
<p>However, when they reached the vicinity of the county, they met villagers returning from there. They were relishing the fresh gossip they had heard in the west market of the county town that morning.</p>
<p>It was said that last night, the Ding father and son had bought their way into attending a banquet with the important people in the county town.</p>
<p>But the father and son, not knowing how much liquor they had already drunk at home, started talking nonsense as soon as they were seated at the banquet.</p>
<p>Master Ding, when he heard his future in-law praising his son’s substantial knowledge, he actually laughed and said that his second son was an ignorant scoundrel. In the past few exams, he had hired someone to take it for him, and had paved his way up with silver.</p>
<p>Speaking with such pride about his son’s cheating scandal, made everyone present look at each other in disbelief.</p>
<p>And Ding’s second son was even more “drunk”. He asked the county magistrate where he bought his concubine with such a voluptuous figure, saying it would be great if he could sleep with her a few times.</p>
<p>In short, the Ding father and son didn’t speak one reasonable word, and their future in-law was so embarrassed that he wanted to hide under the table.</p>
<p>In the end, the Ding father and son granted a stick beating by the furious County Magistrate and thrown out. Offending everyone at such an occasion, the future and marriage prospects of Young Master Ding are in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Hearing about the Ding family’s scandal, Xue Lian gui and Qiao Lian felt assuaged. However, they knew the Ding family, despite their downfall, still had some influence, so it was still best to lay low for a while.</p>
<p>Their old donkey was getting on in years and couldn’t pull a heavy cart, so for most of the journey, Xue Lian gui, with his injured leg and Ranran rode in the cart, while Qiao Lian led the donkey from the front.</p>
<p>Thanks to the miraculous powers of the immortal Su, the carpenter did not feel any pain for the first three days. It was only on the third day that his leg began to ache as if pricked by needles.</p>
<p>But Xue Lian gui had no time to worry about his leg pain, because his daughter Ranran suddenly became ill a day after they left Juefeng Village.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t have a fever, but she seemed to wither like a flower drained of water, her small face quickly turning waxen and thin.</p>

<p><br/>Since Ranran had never been like this before, Qiao lian was terrified and hurriedly sought a doctor at their temporary lodging. However, the doctor said that Ranran’s pulse was so weak that it was barely detectable. She was likely nearing the end of her life, so he advised the couple to prepare for the worst.</p>
<p>After saying this, the doctor didn’t even take the consultation fee and left in a hurry.</p>
<p>Poor Ranran who had also heard the doctor’s words, actually comforted her parents with a smile, “Father and Mother, please don’t be grieved, my illness had always……been a burden to you, and if I were to pass this way, you can be relieved. My life has been…..there has been nothing bad, with you as my parents, I am very contented.”</p>
<p>The couple, helpless, watched their daughter trying to comfort them and cried in agony. At that moment, Qiao lian suddenly remembered the faceless immortal’s prediction that their daughter did not have long to live.</p>
<p>Although she had not taken it seriously at the time, she now grasped at it like a lifeline. They had been traveling for two days and had just arrived in Yongcheng. The couple hurriedly asked the locals for directions to the western mountains. The local said, that’s fortunate,  the western mountains is not far from where they are, and there indeed lives an immortal and divine doctor named Su Yishui.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Qiao lian completely let go of any doubt and rushed with her husband to the western mountains in their donkey cart. When they reached the foot of the mountain, Qiao lian was ready to carry her daughter up the steep path. She saw the veiled immortal Su standing in a pavilion below, as if waiting for someone.</p>
<p>Qiao lian couldn’t care less about his frightening appearance, she rushed over and kowtowed to beg the divine doctor to save her daughter’s life. </p>
<p>Su Yishui came over, looked at Ranran lying in the donkey cart, took out a porcelain bottle, and had Qiao lian pour its contents into Ranran’s mouth. In a short while, Ranran’s waxen face gained a hint of color, as if a wilted flower had absorbed water and regained some vitality.</p>
<p>Master Su was indeed a divine doctor, and despite his ugly appearance, they were still grateful. </p>
<p>Ranran found the water very sweet. Once she regained her breath she asked “What medicine is this?” <br/>Su Yishui, through his veil, said mildly, “It’s water soaked with tree roots.” <br/>Ranran had wanted to sound out the prescription, but who would have thought that the divine doctor was so cunning, giving such a superficial answer.</p>
<p>Master Su stated that taking medicine only treated the symptoms and not the root cause. For Ranran to be healthy again, she had to stay behind. Given Ranran’s condition, the couple was desperate and saw this as a ray of hope. However, they couldn’t agree to leave their beloved daughter behind.</p>
<p>Ranran is also sixteen now, and they had to be cautious about gender boundaries. They are willing to stay as well, offering to work as servants without pay to thank the divine doctor and accompany their daughter during her illness.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Master Su was very business-like, saying he preferred peace and quiet and didn’t want outsiders staying on the mountain. They are free to leave with their daughter if they wished, but they had to leave a tael of gold as the fee for the treatment just now.</p>
<p>Qiao lian was dumbfounded, having never heard of such an outrageous consultation fee. Was the divine doctor trying to charge exorbitant prices? Su Yishui seemed uninterested to argue with the woman from the village. Without mentioning the fee again, he turned and went up the mountain.</p>
<p>Qiao lian, seeing him leave, immediately followed, calling out urgently. However, the divine doctor, was swift as the wind and disappeared in a moment.</p>
<p>Xue Lian gui, stopping Qiaolian, said softly, “Don’t shout anymore. You’ve already angered him. Look at his old robe, washed pale without color. He must be struggling to make ends meet, so he wanted to charge more now that there is finally a consultation.”</p>
<p>Qiao lian slapped her hand in frustration, “Don’t you think I know that. But the price was too outrageous. There should have been room for negotiation. Why did he leave without a word?”</p>
<p>Qiao lian wanted to go up the mountain, but for some reason, she couldn’t find her way in.</p>
<p>Eventually, they could only take their daughter back to the inn where they had stayed.</p>
<p>The innkeeper told them that only the nobles and wealthy could afford to seek medical treatment on **Xishan. Master Su was also very particular about who he treats. He only treats three patients a year regardless of their condition, each consultant at a fee of a hundred taels of gold.<br/><br/>**<em>western mountains will be refereed to as XiShan from this point forth</em></p>
<p>Qiao lian was dumbfounded and asked if anyone would really seek his treatment at such a sky-high price. Wasn’t that just throwing money away?</p>
<p>But the innkeeper looked at her as if she were a country bumpkin and said, “No one? There’s a mad scramble for it! Gold has a price, but a divine doctor is priceless. If you don’t believe me, tomorrow is the day he treats patients this year. You’ll see for yourselves. It’s a rare kindness that he made an exception to treat your daughter for only a tael of gold! This is an incredible act of benevolence. “</p>
<p>Qiao lian, being mocked by the innkeeper, felt uneasy. The next day, they hurried to Xishan again on their donkey cart.</p>
<p>But this time, they couldn’t even get close to the mountain. The road and bridges at the foot of the mountain were blocked by all kinds of luxurious carriages.</p>
<p>It was said that many nobles and dignitaries had come to seek medical treatment, and just comparing their backgrounds and wealth, many had already been pushed out of the queue.</p>
<p>This time, only the burly man Yu Chen, who followed the faceless man, came down the mountain. He looked at a stack of visiting cards, seemed to randomly select three, announced the names and dispersed everyone else.</p>
<p>This upset those who weren’t selected. One of the richly dressed servants huffed, “My Master is the son of the current Prime Minister Lin. Why did you choose some small officials to treat and neglected my master?”</p>
<p>Yu Chen sternly replied, “My Master treats illness based on the virtue of the patient. If the patient is a deceitful and wicked person, even the best medical skills can’t cure them.”</p>
<p>As Prime Minister Lin was notoriously corrupt and had framed many loyal officials, this statement quelled the anger of those who didn’t get selected. Regardless, it was clear that Master Su was uncompromising, not sparing any face for the powerful elites.</p>
<p>The servant of the Lin family was furious. Coming from the capital, he had quite a temper. Upon hearing these disparaging words from an uncouth nobody about an esteemed official , he reached out to grab Yu Chen. But before his hand could touch Yu Chen, his clothes shone with a golden light, and the servant howled in pain, rolling on the ground.</p>
<p>It was said that Master Su was an immortal who had cultivated on the mountain, and even his two servants had received some celestial favor and were not ordinary people.</p>
<p>After demonstrating his supernatural powers, Yu Chen turned and ascended the mountain. </p>
<p>Those he named could freely go up, but others who wanted to climb the mountain were blocked by an invisible barrier.</p>
<p>This spectacle completely intimidated first-time seekers of medical treatment. The son of the Prime Minister, who was in a sedan chair, also reprimanded his servant, implying that they should not disrespect the immortal and return next time even if they failed this time.</p>
<p>It seemed that Master Su’s medical skills were indeed extraordinary, as even the Prime Minister’s son did not dare to offend him.</p>
<p>Observing from afar and hearing the crowd’s discussions, Qiao lian was thoroughly convinced. She now realized how invaluable the opportunity to consult this divine doctor was.</p>
<p>Seeing her daughter’s spirit waning again the next morning, Qiao lian was already desperate enough to sell herself to save her daughter, wanting to kneel and beg the divine doctor once more.</p>
<p>After the crowd had dispersed, she eagerly led her daughter to the mountain, but upon reaching the foot, it was as if the mountain was covered by a dome and they couldn’t enter.</p>
<p>After several attempts and as dusk approached, Ranran couldn’t bear it any longer and stepped off the cart to try to walk a few steps forward. She easily entered the mountain.</p>
<p>Seeing her parents are unable to follow, Ranran said, “Mother, stay with Father at the foot of the mountain. I’ll be back soon.”</p>
<p>Qiao lian had never let her daughter out of her sight, let alone on such a mysterious mountain. How could she be at ease letting her go alone?</p>
<p>But Ranran smiled and said, “If those masters wanted to detain me, neither Father nor Mother could stop them. I don’t think Master Su is a bad person. We’ve already offended him, and it’s a special favor that he’s allowing me to go up the mountain. Please don’t worry, Mother. I’ll be back soon.”</p>
<p>Qiao lian knew that her daughter, although physically weak, had always been perceptive. Moreover, her words made sense.</p>
<p>Seeing Ranran’s cheeks, which had turned rosy after taking the medicine yesterday, had turned waxen again today, Qiao lian felt helpless. She could only hope for the best and let her daughter go up the mountain first.</p>
<p>So Ranran bid farewell to her mother and went up the mountain alone.</p>
<p>Strangely, after entering the mountain, Ranran’s feeble body felt much lighter. Her chest, which had been stuffy, also breathed more freely. It was as if a fish trapped in a net was released back into the water, feeling indescribably comfortable.</p>
<p>She took a few deep breaths and then, lifting her skirt, followed the winding mountain path and began going up.</p>
<p>This mountain was different from Juefeng Mountain, with lush greenery everywhere, making it a refreshing sight.</p>
<p>Although there were many forks on the mountain, Ranran walked more and more as if in a trance, as if she had walked on this same path in a dream before. She actually did not take any wrong turn and smoothly reached the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the top and seeing the dilapidated houses built against the cliffs, Ranran understood why the seemingly transcendent Master Su had to persist to earn more money – maintaining and rebuilding these old houses on the high mountain would indeed require a lot of gold and silver.</p>
<p>However, looking at the neglected and unimpressive courtyard, it was hard to tell where Master Su’s money had gone.</p>
<p>Yu Tong, the woman with thick brows, was already waiting in front of the courtyard. Seeing Ranran, she said, “The Master is treating patients right now. You can wait in the east room.”</p>
<p>After that, she led Ranran to a house adjacent to a garden.</p>
<p>Ranran, who had grown up in a village, had never been in any grand houses. From the cobweb-covered beams and corners, she could tell that this house was once exquisitely and elegantly built. Even the old curtains hanging by the windows had been made of fine silks and fabrics.</p>
<p>Even the wealthy Master Ding would have been reluctant to use such refined fabric for clothes!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these fabrics were too old, severely faded, and exuded an air of decay. Although the floor and table were regularly cleaned, it was evident that maintaining so many houses on the mountain with just three people was a bit overwhelming.</p>
<p>Compared to the dilapidated house, the cakes on the table were truly attractive, looking like delicate cherry blossoms in bloom.</p>
<p>Ranran’s stomach was already growling with hunger and she felt like eating the cakes. But she didn’t dare to touch them and could only stare longingly.</p>
<p>Yu Tong kindly reminded her, “…My master has abstained from food for a long time. My brother and I, although we haven’t reached the realm of immortals, also try to eat only one meal a day. These cakes are made of wax and can’t be eaten. They’re just placed here to fill the space on the table.”</p>
<p>Ranran nodded in admiration. Clearly, Yu Tong, the housekeeper, was frugal with money but also had some elegant pursuits. If there were any visitors to the mountain, placing a plate of wax cakes could also save face.</p>

<p>At this moment, Ranran’s stomach started growling, so she had no choice but to snack on the pumpkin seeds she had brought with her to stave off her hunger. Yu Tong realized belatedly and grabbed a handful of peanuts from the kitchen for her.</p>
<p>As Ranran focused on peeling the peanuts, Yu Tong watched her silently.</p>
<p>After leaving Juefeng Village that day, Master returned to Jue Mountain and broke off a branch from the Rebirth Tree, and also dug up a section of its roots.</p>
<p>After their return to Xishan, he planted the branch in the garden and used spiritual water to help the branch take root— if she guessed correctly, this girl was the spirit fruit that had been squeezed off the Rebirth Tree.</p>
<p>An immature spirit fruit, if it strays too far from the Rebirth Tree on Jue Mountain, is bound to start lacking spiritual energy, so Master brought a branch of the Rebirth Tree here.</p>
<p>When he first attached the soul into the tree, Master expended his own Golden Core and sacrificed blood from his wrist, so he is connected to the reborn spirit fruit. When he encountered this young girl in the village, it is very likely that he recognized her through their shared aura.</p>
<p>Moreover, her name also contains the character “Ran,” could she be Mu Ranwu reborn?</p>
<p>Thinking that she might not be the demonic woman Mu Qingge but the kind-hearted sister who once helped Master, Yu Tong felt relieved and treated her warmly.</p>
<p>Master had instructed her not to say too much. Yu Tong, always cautious, naturally kept her mouth shut and did not mention the peculiarities of this young girl to even her brother.</p>
<p>“Not enough? Want me to grab a few more handfuls?” Yu Tong, usually very careful with expenses, made an unusually generous offer.</p>
<p>Ranran shook her head and asked, “How were these peanuts roasted? They have a special roasted aroma that I can’t quite place.”</p>
<p>Yu Tong smiled and said, “They’re just ordinary peanuts, but they got a bit damp recently. I didn’t want to waste them, so I took the opportunity to roast them in the cauldron vent while Master was refining pills. The flavor turned out really good!”</p>
<p>Ranran nodded in realization. As a food-loving girl, she appreciated the down-to-earth approach of Master Su who is willing to use a pill-refining cauldron to roast peanuts. Despite his blurred features, this added a few points of likability.</p>
<p>At this moment, the tall man in a simple and elegant white robe walked quickly along the garden path towards them. Ranran noticed that he made no sound when walking, as if gliding over waves, truly embodying the true grace of an immortal.</p>
<p>Thinking how her mother was fearful yesterday, for scolding him for extorting money, Ranran tactfully apologized on her mother’s behalf first.</p>
<p>After Su Yishui gestured for Yu Tong to leave the room, he slowly sat down and carefully examined the young girl in front of him through the thin veil covering his face. Her emaciated appearance was like a hungry ghost or a consumptive, even her originally passably delicate face seemed somewhat damaged.</p>
<p>He leisurely asked, “Are you satisfied with the houses and courtyards here?”</p>
<p>What’s there to be satisfied with in such a dilapidated mountain dwelling?</p>
<p>Ranran dared not speak her mind and could only try to pick out something to compliment, “You can tell at a glance that you are a person of high taste. The carvings on the beams are very exquisite!”</p>
<p>She then heard Su Yishui say in a flat tone, “These houses were built by another. I don’t really like such extravagant and ostentatious styles.”</p>
<p>Ranran, having little interaction with outsiders since childhood, struggled to handle such conversation killers and could only force a laugh. She then took out a bag from her waist, offered a handful of her own roasted pumpkin seeds, and asked, “Immortal Su, would you like some?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui did not accept, mildly stating, “I have been fasting for three years… Although the houses on the mountain are somewhat dilapidated, I will have someone repair them in a few days. You still have no foundation and must eat the food of the mortal world. I have instructed Yu Tong to purchase more rice and meat. You can also receive three taels of silver each month to help support your parents…”</p>
<p>Such a generous offer hit all of Ranran’s soft spots. Born with a love for food, she had always only had simple meals of radishes and greens due to her family’s poverty.</p>
<p>Just now, she passed by the kitchen and indeed saw Yu Chen transporting things up the mountain. The newly hung hams and sausages in the courtyard were as festive as New Year’s firecrackers.</p>
<p>There were also baskets of fruits and vegetables, full of the atmosphere of daily life, completely different from her imagined cultivation lifestyle of absorbing the essence of the sun and moon and drinking dew.</p>
<p>This made Ranran feel a bit more at ease. At least she could eat her fill on the mountain.</p>
<p>The most important thing was that he said he would give her three taels of silver every month. If she could earn money to support her family, wouldn’t that greatly alleviate her parents’ hardships?</p>
<p>However, such generous treatment made Ranran somewhat uneasy. She probed, “Why such wonderful benefits? What do you expect me to do?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui mildly stated, “Disciples who enter Xishan have always been treated well. You are not the only one I am accepting. In a few days, you will see your fellow disciples.”</p>
<p>This made Ranran feel even more at ease. Perhaps Master Su truly desired to pass on his teachings. If she was not the only disciple, at least she would have companions in the future.</p>
<p>Ranran knew that her illness had always been a burden to her family. Even their departure from the village this time was because of her. Now that she had the opportunity to share her parents’ burden, Ranran was most willing to stay in spite of the risk.</p>
<p>Thus, the matter of Ranran becoming a disciple of the Lingxi Palace was settled.</p>
<p>That day, Ranran went down the mountain to discuss everything with her parents. Although Qizo Lian did not care about the three taels of silver as subsidy, thinking that Master Su could cure her daughter’s illness, she could only reluctantly leave her on the mountain.</p>
<p>As a result, the couple temporarily rented a house in a town not far from Xishan. Ranran said her Shifu has graciously allowed her to visit them once a month, which made the carpenter couple feel even more at ease.<br/><br/><em>** I am going to use Shifu in this case since Mister/Master is used by other characters for a different designation, and Teacher sounds too stiff</em></p>
<p>Yu Tong arranged for her to stay in a room next to the garden, which was filled with all kinds of exotic flowers and plants, including a half-dead tree.</p>
<p>According to Yu Tong, this was a branch that Master had broken off from an ancient tree. It barely rooted after being watered with water steeped in thousand-year-old ginseng.</p>
<p>Ranran’s room was very close to this small tree. Yu Tong pointed to a pitch-black large vat and said that it contained spiritual water. Ranran was instructed to water this wilting tree every day.</p>
<p>Although Su Yishui had accepted Ranran as a disciple, he seemed to have no interest in teaching her any skills. He only personally took her into the main hall of the house on Xishan.</p>
<p>The plaque in the main hall, covered in dust, faintly bore the three characters “Lingxi Palace.”</p>
<p>It is said that the founder of Lingxi Palace was named Mu Qingge. When she was alive, she widely accepted disciples and the place was bustling. The rules and disciplines of Lingxi Palace were written in a free and unrestrained style on the entire wall.</p>
<p>As Qiao lian had helped in the village school’s kitchen for two years, Ranran was able to study a little without paying tuition. She managed to barely make out the rules.</p>
<p>However, these rules were truly bizarre and somewhat incomprehensible. For example, one might not cultivate their temperament, but must not neglect their appearance and clothing, needing to dress beautifully every day to please the Master.</p>
<p>Another example was that meals could be minimal but must not lack in refinement. One must taste all the flavors of the mortal world to cultivate the essence of the Great Dao, lest the Nascent Soul forms without retaining the sense of taste, leaving regrets.</p>
<p>There were many more such unorthodox sect rules written with great detail.</p>
<p>Although Ranran was not versed in the ways of cultivation and immortality, she felt that the rules of Lingxi Palace were somewhat contradictory. If one simply wanted to be a prodigal child and a wastrel, there was no need to learn anything in order to comply with all the rules and disciplines.</p>
<p>As she was looking up, she suddenly heard a deep voice behind her asking, “Can you do all of these?”</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to her, her Shifu had been standing behind her and asked the question.</p>
<p>Ranran quickly took a few steps backwards and replied with ambition, “Disciple will definitely try her best to achieve them!”</p>
<p>However, Su Yishui was not very satisfied. Even though he was behind a veil, she could feel his somewhat critical gaze.</p>
<p>Ranran looked down at her somewhat faded dress and thought about her emaciated appearance due to illness, which indeed violated the first rule. She immediately said, “I will change into a nicer dress tomorrow…”</p>
<p>But her Shifu snorted coldly, “The rules on the wall are all nonsensical dog farts. Can’t you even realize that?”</p>
<p>Although Su Yishui had no face, his demeanor was that of a transcendent immortal. The sudden use of the phrase “dog fart” felt as jarring as placing excrement on a jade plate.</p>
<p>However, Ranran smoothly went along with it, widening her eyes in realization and saying, “Shifu’s insight is profound. I also felt the same, but I lacked Shifu’s foresight. Then… which rule should the disciple follow?”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, her Shifu seemed to think she was unteachable. After giving her another cold look, he turned and left with a sweep of his sleeves.</p>
<p>At dinner time, Ranran ate with the Yu siblings. Seeing the table full of meat and dishes, it was comparable to a wealthy landlord’s feast.</p>
<p>Yu Tong sighed while muttering, “Master exceptionally instructed me to buy more meat, vegetables, and grains to welcome the new disciple. Ranran, you should be grateful to the Master. But seeing how thin you are, you probably can’t eat that much… If you can’t finish it, I’ll set some aside and hang it in the well, so we can eat it again tomorrow.”</p>
<p>No one responded to her words.</p>
<p>Ranran initially began to taste the food with great hope, but after the first bite, she paused, unsure of what to say.</p>
<p>The entire table of food was prepared by Yu Tong, who was feeling bad about too many dishes. But Ranran was feeling bad that the good ingredients had all been ruined.</p>
<p>Clearly, Yu Tong, who had also been fasting with her Master, had lost her sense of taste. The dishes she cooked were either lacking oil or undercooked, making them very unappetizing.</p>
<p>However, Yu Chen seemed not to mind his sister’s cooking skills. The greasy and rich dishes were too delicious for him to bother with talking. Having not touched meat and vegetables for a long time, he devoured them like an army without caring if they are cooked properly.</p>
<p>Ranran, who was picky, really couldn’t eat it. Unable to leave the table yet, she tried to make conversation by mentioning her lesson on the rules of Lingxi Palace with Shifu earlier.</p>
<p>When the rules were mentioned, Yu Chen’s face showed shame as he said, “Although Master comes from a wealthy background, he has always practiced frugality and has been fasting very early on, almost transcending the mortal body, being indifferent to money and material items. If it weren’t for our lack of progress, still unable to break free from worldly habits, why would Master need to treat those people to earn money to support us?”</p>
<p>Having said that, he fiercely finished off a greasy chicken drumstick.</p>
<p>Yu Tong felt she needed to warn Master’s young new disciple, so she wouldn’t be led astray by the rules left by the former Master of Lingxi Palace, “The previous Master of Lingxi Palace fell into the demonic path and was not a good person. Your Shifu is the complete opposite of her. Don’t learn from that bad Master!”</p>
<p>Ranran listened and nodded in agreement. In her opinion, it wasn’t just the previous Master who was bad news; her faceless Shifu was also not a good character either. He gave her a test out of nowhere, using the old rules of the demon-possessed Master to test her character, almost causing her to fail.</p>
<p>Not imparting any teachings and testing immediately after admission, such a Shifu is cunning and hateful! Would her days as a disciple in Lingxi Palace be somewhat bleak?</p>

<p>But fortunately, Ranran is not the only novice disciple in Lingxi Palace.</p>
<p>Although XiShan’s Lingxi Palace had not accepted disciples for a long time, with the reputation of the immortal physician Su Yishui, it was very easy to gather disciples.</p>
<p>The rowdy applicants created quite the bustling occasion, but in the end, only three disciples were accepted.</p>
<p>Among them, the two young men were older than Ranran. The senior brother was named Gao Cang, said to have a background in martial arts. Tall and upright, he is a young man with thick eyebrows and big eyes.</p>
<p>The second senior brother, surnamed Bai, was called Bai Baishan. Although he was thin, he exuded an air of scholarly elegance.</p>
<p>In addition to the two  senior brothers, Ranran also gained a third senior sister named Qiu Xier, who, like Ranran, was an incurable sickly child. Her family couldn’t afford the medical expenses and she was originally left to die, but was taken in by Shifu for treatment.</p>
<p>It was said that Qiu Xier suffered from chronic chest pain, but she was fair, plump and cute.</p>
<p>Ranran originally had doubts why Master Su would take in a sickly child like her. Now it seems that Shifu has an unusual hobby of collecting sickly children, probably to improve his medical skills?</p>
<p>The three of them were ranked by age, not by the order in which they arrived at the mountain. However, they were a bit puzzled about how to address Yu Chen and Yu Tong.</p>
<p>Su Yishui said, “They are also cultivating together with me, so they are considered as your elders, you will refer to them as Great Uncle Masters.”</p>
<p>The Yu siblings insisted that that was out of the question. Even if they became immortals one day, they would still be serving Su Yishui. How could they disrupt the hierarchy and call their Master as their brother?</p>
<p>After some debate, Su Yishui, becoming somewhat tired of these worldly matters, waved his sleeve and went to meditate at the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>After discussing among themselves, the younger disciples decided to call Yu Chen and Yu Tong “Great Uncle Master” and “Second Uncle Master”; the Yu siblings will still call Su Yishui “Master.”</p>

<p>They chose a day and the four young disciples knelt down together to offer tea and performed the ceremony of acknowledging the portrait of the Founding Master of Lingxi Palace.</p>
<p>Although Lingxi Palace had changed hands, the portrait of the former Grand Master had not been removed.</p>
<p>During the ceremony, Ranran sneaked a peek at the portrait of the demonic Grand Master hanging high in the hall. It was actually of a woman with beauty that exudes a bright aura. She was dressed in fiery red, riding a white tiger, with her jade feet raised high, an embroidered shoe hanging off her foot, and holding a large wine gourd. Her entire demeanor seemed frivolous and licentious.</p>
<p>How did such a female drunkard produce a disciple like Su Yishui, who is so strict and disciplined?</p>
<p>Xue Ranran privately thinks that her Shifu, Su Yishui, is pure of heart with no earthly desires, that he seems more like a monk in meditation. He does not seem to fit in with the old rules and style of Lingxi Palace.</p>
<p>Having produced such an unsatisfactory disciple and the Founding Master falling early to demonic ways, it’s no wonder that the Lingxi Palace has been on the decline year by year,</p>
<p>The three senior brothers and sister are all new to the Sect. Although Xue Ranran is the youngest, she has arrived a few days earlier than them, so she confidently led them to familiarize themselves with every corner of Lingxi Palace. She also introduced the ridiculous old rules on the walls, warning her senior brothers and sister to take heed and not to follow them at all.</p>
<p>The third senior sister, Qiu Xier, looked at the old rules with a face full of regret and muttered, “Alas, I wasn’t here for the good times…”</p>
<p>The second senior brother, Bai Baishan, is quite learned. He has family members who have practiced Taoism and is familiar with the past stories of Xishan. At this time, he vividly told his junior brothers and sisters about the history of their Sect.</p>
<p>It is said that the female demon possessed great power but was insatiable in her desires, and fantasized about dominating the Three Realms. She opened the gateway of the Demon Realm to usher in the Demon Lord to destroy the world.</p>
<p>This act was condemned by the righteous path, and the battle at Xishan at the time sent shockwaves throughout the world. The three major sects, together with many righteous fighters, exerted all their power to finally subdue the female demon.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Lingxi Palace is only a name from the past. Its already changed fundamentally, returning to the righteous path.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier sighed after hearing this, “It’s already been twenty years. Mu Qingge was also our Grandmaster. Even if she commit wrongs, we should not disrespect her in our words.”</p>
<p>The reticent eldest senior brother, Gao Cang, also nodded, “My mother said that we should not criticize our elders recklessly. We are here to learn skills, no matter what path of righteousness or demonic, we are on whatever path our Shifu is on.”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran also nodded quickly in agreement, although she, like Qiu Xier, felt that the old rules were better.</p>

<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But when Ranran had accompanied the Second Uncle Master, Yu Tong, down the mountain to buy groceries a few days ago, she saw her haggling with the vegetable vendor for a difference of three cents for a long time.</p>
<p>From this, she could tell that the Sect rules have been set. <br/>The first rule of Lingxi Palace today is: Be frugal whenever you can.</p>
<p>For this reason, she dared not eat too much at the dining table, fearing that she would be kicked out for being too wasteful. At the same time, for the sake of her own sensitive taste buds, she volunteered to take on the task of cooking three meals a day.</p>
<p>Yu Tong originally didn’t like these kitchen chores. In the past, she would just eat some coarse cakes with wild fruits to stave off hunger.</p>
<p>After all, to get rid of the mortal flesh, how could she indulge her appetite?</p>
<p>Since Ranran likes to cook, let her make what she loves to eat. In a few years, the children will probably start practicing fasting and cultivating.</p>
<p>As for food, make what you love to eat while you can!</p>

<p>After the new disciples entered the sect, they naturally had to choose the direction of their cultivation.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, whether on the path of immortality or demonic cultivation, there is no difference when they start out as beginners, it all depends on the eventual path of cultivation.</p>
<p>Most people practice the inner cultivation path of building foundation, forming the golden core, nurturing the Nascent Soul and ascending through tribulations, but this requires innate physique and serendipity.</p>
<p>If you have a natural talent and extraordinary physique, like Su Yishui, the cultivation progress can be rapid and ascension will not be far off.</p>
<p>But if you have an ordinary mortal physique like Yu Chen, forcibly cultivating will only extend your lifespan for a while, but in the end, you can’t escape the cycle of life, old age, sickness, and death.</p>
<p>Therefore, a small number of people take a different path, practicing refining and taking pills, refining immortal pills to help themselves ascend to immortality.</p>
<p>This path is not dependent on physique, but the failure rate is very high. The cultivators often toil until they are old and white-haired, just barely entering the beginner stage. There are also examples like Emperor Qin Shi Huang, who practiced until death without seeing any results.</p>
<p>The last is the crooked path similar to demonic path. For example, supplementing one’s spiritual form with the spiritual form of others, relying on absorbing the foundation building and golden core of others to supplement one’s own cultivation. The so-called yin-yang replenishment in the folk is mostly this kind.</p>
<p>However, there are also righteous people who practice this third method, capturing demonic cultivators who cause harm to the world, absorbing their spiritual power to enhance their own cultivation, which can be considered a righteous method.</p>
<p>Su Yishui adopted a laissez-faire approach to the four newly accepted disciples, letting them decide what they want to learn.</p>
<p>Among them, the two male disciples quickly identified the path of cultivating Qi and building foundation, as their talents are relatively good, this path is also easier for them.</p>
<p>The third senior sister, Qiu Xier, has a slightly worse physique, but she is also considered to have potential.</p>
<p>Only Xue Ranran is incompatible with the path of immortality, with an inner emptiness so vast that it echoes. Even Yu Tong was surprised to note that there are even worse physiques than her brother for cultivating immortality.</p>
<p>Yu Tong was very disappointed because of this – after all, Ranran was born from the spiritual fruit, but her physique is even worse than that of her previous life’s Mu Ranwu. It seems that she will continue to be mediocre in this life. Since she had been pushed off the tree early, this deficiency is permanent and can’t be rectified.</p>

<p>After some research, the two young girls Ranran and Xier, decided to take the path of refining and taking pills.</p>
<p>At the very least, Xue Ranran felt that it was quite cozy to be fanning the hot cauldron while refining pills and can even doze off a little. It’s much better than meditating and fasting or fighting and killing.</p>
<p>Since they decided to take the path of pill refining, they had to claim their cauldron. Qiu Xier received a brand new copper cauldron with a three-clawed golden lid with a copper turtle on top, which was very imposing.</p>
<p>As for Xue Ranran, it seemed that Shifu had ran out of money, so she was only given a black metal cauldon from long ago.</p>
<p>Ranran suspected that this cauldron had been damaged by fire before, as there was obvious repair marks on the bottom.</p>
<p>As for their Shifu’s partiality, Qiu Xier felt quite embarrassed and offered to exchange with Ranran. However, Ranran felt that it didn’t matter if it was old or new. After all, she had already been determined to be useless, and it was not good to hold onto a new cauldron and not put it to proper use.</p>
<p>When it came to test their cauldrons, the two of them refined the entry-level Qingxin ( Mind Cleansing ) Pill.</p>
<p>This type of pill is very effective in removing the irritability generated during meditation. The formula is simple, one just needs to match the medical ingredients according to the prescription and control the fire.</p>
<p>After three days and three nights, Qiu Xi er refined two shiny pills.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran also put in a lot of effort. She stared at the cauldron fire for three nights with wide eyes, until her eyes were red. When dawn came, it was finally time to open the cauldron and take out the pills.</p>
<p>However, when opening her cauldron, Qiu Xier took a sniff and asked with a surprised tone, “What a nice fragrance, how come it smells different from mine?”</p>

<p>Xue Ranran affectionately looked at the two pills she refined for the first time and eagerly said, “Our pills are just right for our two senior brothers to take to help them relieve the fatigue of meditation.”</p>
<p>The path of cultivating Qi and building foundation is a tough one, and the two senior brothers have been meditating in the Grass hall for three days with Great Uncle Master Yu Chen, so they could really use these pills.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier, taking advantage of her longer legs, ran to the refined second senior brother first and handed her pill to him solicitously.</p>
<p>Bai Baishan thanked the third senior sister, took the pill and swallowed it with water.</p>
<p>Ranran, who arrived later, handed one of the pills from her medicine box to their senior brother Gao Cang.</p>
<p>Unlike the second senior brother who swallowed the pill in one gulp, Gao Cang chewed the pill for a long time, seemingly reluctant to swallow it. Xue Ranran asked a little impatiently, “How is it? What do you feel?”</p>
<p>Gao Cang finally swallowed it reluctantly and said, “It has a seasoned taste… somewhat like soup-filled meat buns…”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran’s little face fell slightly – the Qingxin Pill should have a calming effect when taken, aiding in fasting. Why did the senior brother find it appetizing?</p>
<p>Could it be… because she was hungry while fanning the fire and had juicy meat buns on her mind, that caused the change in the taste of the pills?</p>
<p>At dinner time, the second senior brother who just came back from meditating in the Grass hall only drank a bowl of thin porridge to settle his stomach.</p>
<p>But the eldest senior brother, like a hungry tiger, ate up all the dishes on the table and still shouted that he was hungry. Later on, he even sneaked up in the middle of the night and started gnawing on the air-dried raw ham in the corridor where food was stored.</p>
<p>If Shifu hadn’t realized it in time and pressed his sleep acupoint, the eldest senior brother might have died from intestinal swelling due to insatiable eating.</p>
<p>And Gao Cang’s insatiable greed, is obviously related to the Qingxin Pill with the taste of meat buns.</p>
<p>The three days of meditation were completely ruined by the meat buns. Gao Cang not only failed to still his worldly desires, but his appetite was stimulated, and he couldn’t control himself.</p>
<p>When Su Yishui asked Yu Chen to carry Gao Cang away, Xue Ranran came forward to Shifu with a drooping head and admitted that it was her fault.</p>
<p>Su Yishui asked for the remaining pill, pinched off a small piece, sniffed it slightly, and put it in his mouth. The fragment melted immediately. Su Yishui’s body suddenly stiffened slightly, and he threw the remaining pill far away.</p>
<p>Even though his facial features were not clear, it seemed that his forehead was protruding high, probably… frowning?</p>

<p><br/>Xue Ranran squatted down sadly, picking up the pill that her Shifu had thrown on the ground. When she stood up, she made ready  to be scolded by her Shifu. But Su Yishui was silent for a while and then suddenly turned and left.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t feel relieved at all. She had been weak since childhood and had always been a burden to her parents. Now that she had finally found a way to learn skills, she was still useless, how could she not feel depressed?</p>
<p>Qiu Xier, unaware of her junior sister’s distress, let out a long sigh of relief for her and whispered, “It looks like Shifu can’t be bothered to waste words with you, hurry back to your room and hide.”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran silently put the remaining pill back into her box, planning to find an opportunity to recheck the formula and see where she had made a mistake this time.</p>
<p>She then obediently went back to her room, took off her jacket,  crawled into bed to sleep.</p>
<p>But she couldn’t sleep because of the moonlight shining through the window. She was also worried about her senior brother who had overeaten, not knowing how he was doing.</p>
<p>After tossing and turning for a while, Ranran felt that the senior brother might want to drink some light porridge to nourish his stomach early tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>So she tiptoed out of bed, getting ready to go to the kitchen to prepare some porridge.</p>

<p>However, before she reached the kitchen, she saw a dark figure standing in the small kitchen from afar.</p>
<p>Ranran was startled, thinking it was the senior brother sneaking out again. But when she got closer, she found that the person holding a bowl and eating leftovers by the stove… was actually her Shifu…</p>
<p>She remembered that just the other day, she heard her Second Master Uncle Yu Tong proudly mention that their master had transcended the worldly desires and had completely entered the period of fasting from three years ago, occasionally eating petals and dew, absorbing the essence of the sun and moon, and had not consumed any worldly food for a long time.</p>
<p>But the celestial figure that Yu Tong had described was now, taking one bite after another, eating very deliciously…</p>
<p>“Are you hungry? Do you want me to make you some hot food?” Xue Ranran couldn’t help but ask.</p>
<p>It was only when she spoke that Su Yishui, who was immersed in the ham fried rice, became aware of someone behind him.</p>
<p>He turned his head quickly, looking at the young girl behind him with some annoyance.</p>
<p>That Qingxin Pill was too potent!</p>
<p>He had only smelled the aroma and tasted it lightly.</p>
<p>At first, he had only felt a surge of emotions after it entered his mouth, but after calming down, he didn’t feel anything amiss.</p>
<p>But when he sat in meditation at night, sitting on the grass cushion, all he could think about was memories from his youth.</p>

<p>His former Shifu, Mu Qingge, took him to stroll through the long streets of the capital city. Along the way, there was hustle and bustle, numerous shops, with brocade banners fluttering in the wind…</p>
<p>This demoness knew exactly which shop had delicious desserts and pastries, being one who loved to indulge in leisure. She bought a lot along the way, also making him eat a lot, while snickering and saying, “Eat more and put on some weight, once you become ugly, I’ll let you go…”</p>
<p>The laughter that ran wild in the streets pierced through the lonely quiet night, growing in the meditating heart like wild grass. And between the breaths, he seemed to smell the fragrances in those streets once more.</p>
<p>A sense of restlessness grew quietly in the silent night.</p>
<p>Su Yishui felt that he couldn’t calm his mind, so he thought of walking under the moonlight, but before he knew it, he had come to the small kitchen.</p>
<p>After that, he just continued to come in. He saw a bowl of cold ham fried rice on the stove, and he picked it up and started to eat it…</p>
<p>This act of eating, was like water breaking through a dam, out of control. And he was caught red-handed by this sick girl.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran only had good intentions. She was afraid that her Shifu’s stomach, which hadn’t had soup or rice for three years, would get cold from the cold leftovers, so she thought of heating it up for him.</p>
<p>She did not expect that, in the next moment, Su Yishui suddenly grabbed her thin shoulder in a fierce grip.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t have time to cry out before she felt the big hand gripping her shoulder as if it was about to crush it.</p>
<p>Just as she cried out in pain, she suddenly noticed that her Shifu’s face which came up close to her, seemed to melt away like sealing wax under hot water, revealing sharp brows and eyes shining with a cold light of the night.</p>
<p>Ranran ignored the pain in her shoulder and called out a low voice, “Shifu… your face…”</p>
<p>Right then, Su Yishui suddenly let go and took a few steps back, then said coldly, “What are you doing here in the middle of the night instead of sleeping?”</p>
<p>By now, his features had become quite clear.</p>
<p>Just as Ranran had imagined, Su Yishui’s appearance was as stunning as his posture and demeanor. Even though she could not get a clear look in the night, she could still see his tall nose and cold, starry eyes.</p>
<p>But… why did a man who should be in his thirties still have the youthful vigor of an eighteen or nineteen-year-old on his face…</p>
<p>It seemed as if the last twenty years had been frozen on Su Yishui’s face.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t have the leisure to admire her Shifu’s handsome appearance, she just gasped and asked, “…Shifu… you scared me to death.”</p>
<p>Su Yishui said mildly, “It’s dark, I thought you were a thief. Tomorrow, I’ll have Yu Tong get you some ointment to prevent bruises.”</p>
<p>Hearing that her Shifu had mistaken her for someone else, Ranran felt somewhat relieved and coughed to remind him, “Um… Shifu, your face is showing…”</p>

<p>Su Yishui looked into the water tank, and indeed saw his long-lost face reflected back in the clear moonlight…</p>
<p>He seemed slightly startled, then took another hard look at the young girl holding her neck, frowned deeply, and left with a sweep of his sleeves.</p>
<p>Ranran stood blankly for a while, then she soaked the rice and prepared soup before returning to bed.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Early next morning, Su Yishui wore a mask made of ebony wood, covering everything but his mouth, seemingly still ashamed to show his face.</p>
<p>He specifically called Ranran to the tea hall and asked if she had mentioned anything about the revelation of his face, to the other disciples.</p>
<p>Ranran shook her head candidly. The incident had just happened last night, and since she didn’t share a room with her sister Qiu Xier and the others, she had no chance to talk about it.</p>
<p>And since she was now called over before breakfast this morning, she naturally hadn’t spread the word.</p>
<p>Su Yishui nodded and said indifferently, “The first rule of the sect is not to mention or discuss my appearance with anyone. Take it that last night’s incident never happened.”</p>
<p>Ranran did not understand why her Shifu instructed her so, but she obediently nodded. She was a disciple who could receive three taels of silver every month, and she held her Shifu in high regard as if he were a lord.</p>
<p>Since her lord Shifu had spoken, she would follow his orders without questioning. After giving his instructions, Su Yishui looked at her for a while longer, seemingly getting displeased again and icily said, “You may leave.”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>However, it seemed that her fellow disciples had not learned this first new rule.</p>
<p>During the casual conversation at dinner, Qiu Xier regretfully said, “Our Shifu has such great charisma, it’s a pity that he’s not good-looking, and now he’s even wearing a dark mask… It’s said that cultivating immortality can keep one youthful forever, will our Shifu become more pleasing to the eye when he advances his cultivation?”</p>
<p>She had heard of the divine physician on XiShan since she was a child, and so many years had passed, yet her Shifu actually looked so ugly and strange. It seemed that the belief of immortality preserving youth was somewhat overrated.</p>
<p>This also made Qiu Xier, who considered herself not beautiful enough, feel hopeless about her future. If she couldn’t become an immortal, at least cultivating to be youthful and beautiful would not be a waste of the boring time spent fanning the fire by the pill cauldron.</p>
<p>As they spoke, Ranran was focused on eating. Due to the trouble caused by her Qingxin Pill yesterday, she hadn’t eaten well for two consecutive meals. Today, she herself made honey-glazed ribs and delicious fish soup, and was now enjoying her meal.</p>
<p>Hearing her senior sister’s words of envy, Ranran disagreed, saying, “Looks can’t be eaten.”</p>
<p>Beside her, the second senior brother Bai Baishan, who was picking up vegetables, joked, “Your pill can indeed be eaten as a meal, little junior sister. What flavor of pill are you planning to refine next time?”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Ranran’s expression fell. Their senior brother was still on bed rest.</p>
<p>Because of the trouble she caused, even her broken pill cauldron had been taken away by Yu Tong.</p>
<p>According to Yu Tong, Shifu had instructed her to practice meditation first. Only when she could focus without distractions and let go of all thoughts could she start refining pills again.</p>
<p>And their esteemed Shifu, who had now regained his youthful appearance, seemed very stingy about showing himself. He had gone to a cave on the north side of Mount Xi to meditate in seclusion, apparently not planning to come down the mountain for a month.</p>
<p>Since their Shifu was so diligent, how could his disciples slack off? So, apart from eating and fetching water, they spent the rest of their time sitting cross-legged in meditation with the Yu siblings.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier’s dream of attaining beauty had not yet materialized, but her legs seemed they are becoming bowed.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>One day, as the young ones were practicing with Yu Chen, the copper bells hanging on the tree in the courtyard suddenly started ringing.</p>
<p>Yu Tong told them that these bells were connected to the spiritual shield at the foot of the mountain. The continuous ringing indicated that someone was breaking into the mountain.</p>
<p>Normally, ordinary people could not cross the spiritual shield to come up the mountain, but the bells kept ringing and eventually shattered into pieces to the ground.</p>
<p>Obviously, someone had successfully breached the mountain and entered directly through the mountain gate.</p>
<p>The Yu siblings exchanged glances, both getting up and preparing to go down the mountain when the intruders had already arrived in front of them.</p>
<p>The newcomers were a group of tall men and women in moon-white robes, appearing to be around twenty years old. But from their speed and ability to leap to the top of the mountain in an instant, they were clearly not ordinary people, but likely cultivators.</p>
<p>The leader was a man with a red exorcism talisman painted between his brows, wearing a feather crown, and with an arrogant expression. He cupped his fists and said, “I am Wei Fang, the chief disciple of the Jiuhua Sect, and I am here by the order of my master to request Master Su to head to Jueshan to subdue demons.”</p>
<p>The Jiuhua Sect was one of the three major sects that had besieged the female demon back then and was also part of the group that nearly leveled the top of Jueshan some years ago.</p>
<p>Back then, they were at a stalemate with Su Yishui, and since they couldn’t destroy the Reincarnation Tree, they temporarily agreed to wait until the spiritual fruit matured and fell before deciding the fate of the reincarnated female demon.</p>
<p>Now, as the twenty years have passed and the time for the spiritual fruit to fall is approaching, the three major sects have agreed to go to Jueshan together.</p>
<p>But unexpectedly, Jueshan has been occupied by the disciples of the demonic Wei Jiu, making it impossible to enter the mountain. If the situation continues, a fierce battle is inevitable. Therefore, Holy Master Kaiyuan of the Jiuhua Sect sent someone to invite Su Yishui, who is also considered a powerful ally.</p>
<p>However, Yu Chen has no good impression of these righteous cultivators and simply gave a perfunctory greeting, saying, “My master is in seclusion and will not be out until a month later. Please go back.”</p>
<p>Before Wei Fang could respond, his fellow disciples behind him indignantly spoke up, “Even the Jiuhua Sect is not being respected. Is Su Yishui being too arrogant?”</p>
<p>Wei Fang was also dissatisfied and coldly said, “It was your master who obstructed us in every possible way, claiming he needed to undo the Face melting curse, which is why our respected elders left the Reincarnation Tree alone. Now that the demonic Wei Jiu has been drawn here, your master is hiding and not mentioning the curse. Does he really want to live without a face forever and become a faceless immortal?”</p>
<p>These words were practically an insult, and Yu Chen, with his fiery temper, was not about to tolerate it. He made a lightning-fast move, intending to punch the man.</p>
<p>Wei Fang, as the chief disciple of the Jiuhua Sect, has cultivation far superior to Yu Chen’s. So when Yu Chen attacked, he quickly formed an ice spell and cast it towards Yu Chen.</p>
<p>In the next moment, Yu Chen was frozen in ice, unable to move.</p>

<p>The Jiuhua Sect focuses mainly on water based spells out of the five elements, and as expected its disciples can manipulate ice and water extremely well. Seeing that their senior brother has froze that rash man, the rest of the disciples laughed heartily.</p>
<p>“Su Yishui is only capable of training such trash and he has the audacity to challenge us?”</p>
<p>This angered the few Xishan young disciples who had just arrived.</p>
<p>Senior brother Gao Cang was about to rush over, but was stopped by his junior sister Ranran behind him. Their Uncle Master hadn’t even made half a move before being frozen into an ice lump. These novice disciples who had just entered the sect, what can they even achieve?</p>
<p>Gao Cang thought that his younger sister was scared and just glared with wide eyes: “A man can be killed but not insulted! These bastards have bullied us to our faces, how can we be cowards?”</p>
<p>Ranran whispered softly, “Senior brother, aren’t you really good with your slingshot?”</p>
<p>Saying that, she reached into her waist and took out the pill that had been thrown on the ground by Shifu earlier, pinched it into several small balls with her fingers, handed them to the senior brother, and then pointed to the slingshot on his waist.</p>
<p>The slingshot was what he usually used to hit birds with. Seeing that his junior sister took out her refined pill, Gao Cang immediately understood.</p>
<p>He had eaten this thing and had been paralyzed in bed for a whole day and night! So Gao Cang quickly raised his slingshot and shot out his junior sister’s Qingxin pill.</p>
<p>Gao Cang came from a military family, so his slingshot was specially made and very powerful.</p>
<p>Those few small pills shot straight into the mouths of the Jiuhua disciples who were laughing heartily.</p>
<p>The pill melts in the mouth immediately, so those disciples couldn’t spit it out even if they wanted to, and the taste… was too delicious!</p>
<p>The few people smacked their mouths a few times, then glared and said, “You little brat, what did you shoot over?”</p>
<p>Just at this moment, Ranran calmly took off the snack bag from her waist, took out a handful of smoked jerky, and scattered it on the ground like she was feeding dogs.</p>
<p>Wei Fang raised his eyebrows, not understanding what the thin girl was doing.</p>
<p>But at this moment, a few of his disciples behind him widened their eyes, their nostrils moving nonstop. Finally, they couldn’t bear it anymore, they bent down and started picking up and eating the meat that had fallen on the ground.</p>
<p>The appearance of each one of them, were as if they were hungry ghosts reincarnated. Where was a trace of dignity from disciples of a famous righteous Sect?</p>
<p>Qiu Xier couldn’t help but clap and laugh: “Where did this group of wild dogs come from, no wonder they were barking so loudly, it turns out they were hungry and looking for food!”</p>
<p>Wei Fang was also stunned. He hurriedly scolded in a low voice, but those disciples continued to lower their heads and pick up food to eat, some had mud on their mouths but did not care, looking like hungry ghosts.</p>
<p>This also astonished the disciples of the other two major sects, Kongshan sect and the Mt Feiyun sect , who arrived later.</p>
<p>Wei Fang knew that his disciples had been tricked, and the dignity of the Jiuhua Sect was utterly lost by these disciples today. He could only compose his ashen face and put the few disciples who were picking up food on the ground to sleep by hitting their acupoints.</p>
<p>If he couldn’t regain their dignity today, how could he, as the tenth-generation eldest disciple of the Jiuhua Sect, have the nerve to go back to see his Master? Thinking of this, he actually pulled out his sword and rushed towards Gao Cang and the others with killing intent.</p>
<p>But just as the sword was about to strike, a wave of heat surged and he was driven back at once. Just then, the frozen Yu Chen was also freed from the ice that shackled him. Screaming and grabbing Wei Fang’s collar, he threw him far away with extraordinary force.</p>
<p>At this moment, everyone who broke into the mountain gate heard a clear and cold voice echoing in the air: “Xishan does not welcome distant guests, Su is in seclusion, so we won’t be entertaining you all.”</p>
<p>The voice was so very real, approaching closer and closer, as if someone was talking beside their ears, which made their hair stand on end. The disciples of the three major sects couldn’t help but retreat a few steps.</p>
<p>They knew that the person speaking was not nearby. This was the technique of thousand-mile voice channeling used by people with extremely high cultivation.</p>
<p>Thinking that Su Yishui, who was only thirty-six years old, when compared with common cultivators of hundreds of years old, he could only be considered a youngster; but his cultivation progress had far exceeded ordinary people.</p>
<p>Although rumors in the past ten years have suggested that Su Yishui’s cultivation has not recovered well, which was why he has been living in seclusion. Unexpectedly, the move he showed today is still beyond the reach of these disciples from sects with some reputation.</p>
<p>This was true especially for the disciples of the Jiuhua Sect, who were secretly glad that Mu Qingge had taken Su Yishui away from the Jiuhua Sect back then.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if there was such a talented junior in the sect, when would they ever be able to stand out?</p>
<p>Su Yishui obviously hasn’t come out of seclusion yet, and once again used the technique of thousand-mile voice channeling to emit a piercing long shrill, sending the uninvited guests out of Xishan’s mountain gate all at once.</p>
<p>One of those who came from the Kongshan Sect this time was a woman in her thirties with a beautiful appearance, but unfortunately, there was a striking slanting scar on her right cheek.</p>
<p>The scar-faced woman was shaken out of the mountain gate and channeling her qi, stood on the treetops. She also used her spiritual power to send a message to the top of Xishan, saying, “Yishui, we bear no ill intentions in coming here. My Master also invites you to come forward to jointly resist the demonic cultivator Wei Jiu. You surely don’t want the tragedy of the past to happen again… The disciples of the Jiuhua Sect were a bit reckless and impolite. I will apologize to you on their behalf!”</p>
<p>After saying this, she took a long hard look at the Xishan peak covered by lush greenery, hoping for a response from Su Yishui.</p>
<p>However, after waiting for a long time, the mountain top remained silent. The woman showed a most wistful look and left with the disciples of the Kongshan Sect.</p>
<p>Yu Chen, who had practiced with his master in the past, was now the Uncle Master of Gao Cang and Bai Boshan. He was upset that he didn’t perform well today, almost losing his dignity before the younger generation. After shaking off the water droplets from his body and clearing his throat, he angrily cursed the disciples of the Jiuhua Sect for being treacherous and hateful for launching a sneak attack, causing him to fall into their trap.</p>
<p>If they were real men, they should come back and have a fair fight with him for three hundred rounds.</p>
<p>Ranran, being considerate, immediately echoed, “Uncle Master, you were just going easy on them because they are young. Later, I’ll make you a delicious sweet red bean soup to prevent you from catching a cold.”</p>
<p>After easily easing what is an awkward situation, she naturally won the favor of her Uncle Master. Yu Chen smiled at Ranran satisfactorily, shook off the water from his body again, and went to the meditation room to practice his cultivation earnestly.</p>
<p>At dinner, both Yu Chen and Yu Tong were not present, so the young ones ate together. As usual, the dinner prepared by Xue Ranran was delicious, and the fresh and savory braised meatballs were highly praised.</p>
<p>During the meal, Bai Boshan continued to show off the strange tales of immortal cultivation he had garnered. He asked his fellow disciples if they had noticed anything unusual when confronting the three major sects during the day.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier’s mother was a matchmaker in the town, so she was quite worldly and understood the nuances of male and female relationships. She rolled her eyes and said mysteriously, “That woman from the Kongshan Sect with a scar on her face actually called our Shifu ‘Yishui’… Why does it sound a bit …you know?”</p>
<p>Bai Boshan immediately looked at the third junior sister with approval and said, “Do you know? That woman with a scar on her face is the Great Elder of the Kongshan Sect, Wen Hongshan. The Kongshan Sect and the Jiuhua Sect are very close and their disciples often practice cultivation together.”</p>
<p>Our Shifu used to be a disciple of the Jiuhua Sect and had a close relationship with Wen Hongshan. At one point, they almost became an immortal couple.”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran, who loved to hear about the gossip of the older generation, asked while biting into a fried cake, “Then why didn’t it work out? Could it be that my Shifu was rejected because he had no face?”</p>
<p>Bai Boshan, who was well-versed in the history of Xishan’s immortals, dismissed the idea, “Do you think our Shifu has always been faceless? The name of Yishui Xianjun was so famous, who didn’t know it? How many women wanted to become an immortal couple with our Shifu! And there were even some men… In short, our Shifu’s charm was immense!”</p>
<p>Everyone at the table listened with sparkling eyes, and Qiu Xier became flustered, urging, “What happened after that?”</p>
<p>Bai Boshan first bowed with cupped fists to the ancestral hall of Lingxi Palace to apologize to the former GrandMaster, then lowered his voice slightly and said, “How could our former GrandMaster, the female demon, allow others to touch her favored disciple? Just like that, with a wave of her hand, she slashed Wen Hongshan’s face, and the wonderful fate of the immortal couple was broken in an instant…”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran couldn’t help but gasp, feeling that if the former GrandMaster Mu Qingge really acted like this, wasn’t it too extreme.</p>
<p>Didn’t she know that a melon forcibly taken before its time won’t be sweet? To disrupt someone else’s perfect marriage for no reason, it’s no wonder she ended up with a shattered soul.</p>
<p>“Have you all had enough?”</p>
<p>Just as the four of them were sharing the love history of their Shifu, a cold voice suddenly came from behind them—Yu Tong, the Second Uncle Master, was standing behind them with a stern expression.</p>
<p>Bai Boshan, who had been talkative, immediately shrank his neck like a quail.</p>
<p>Compared to the carefree Uncle Master, their Second Uncle Master Yu Tong, who was meticulous about everything, and was not easy to fool. If she found any fault, they couldn’t escape the hard labor of carrying water up and down the mountain.</p>
<p>However, this time, Yu Tong just glared at them and then said to Xue Ranran, “The Master wants you to go to the mountain top.”</p>
<p>Su Yishui had been in seclusion for half a month. It was unclear why he wanted her to meet him before coming out of seclusion. Xue Ranran quickly drank a sip of water and followed Yu Tong to the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>The path to the mountain top was all stone steps. If it were the old Ranran, she would have been exhausted and lying flat after climbing a few steps.</p>
<p>However, since she became a disciple on Xishan, her Shifu had not given her the root spirit water again. Besides meditating, her daily routine was just watering the small tree transplanted outside the window.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the natural environment of the mountains that nourished her; she had never been so comfortable and healthy from her childhood until now.</p>
<p>Yu Tong did not use the riding wind technique, perhaps to let Ranran exercise her muscles and work out, so she accompanied her step by step to the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>However, when they reached the last few steps, Yu Tong did not go up but let her go alone.</p>
<p>When she reached the mountain top, Ranran followed the stone path to the cave entrance. Just as she reached the entrance, she smelled a strong scent of medicine brewing in the cave.</p>
<p>When she peeked inside, Su Yishui was sitting next to the cave entrance, brewing tea.</p>
<p>However, Ranran’s attention was drawn to a small bundle of white fluff curled up beside the tea stove. “Shifu, where did this cat come from? It’s so cute!”</p>
<p>For some reason, after Ranran spoke, the cat bared its teeth and meowed, although it looked fierce, it was a babyishly cute “meow”.</p>
<p>Su Yishui glanced at the cat still acting fierce and pointed to the table opposite: “I got some good tea. Sit down and have a cup.”</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because he was alone in the mountains, Su Yishui did not wear a mask. He did not even tie up his long black hair in a crown. It just cascaded down like a black waterfall, reaching his waist.</p>
<p>Beautiful people are always suitable whether with light or heavy makeup. Shifu, with his eyebrows and eyes exposed, was no exception. The disheveled hair that seemed sloppy on others became poetic and free-spirited on him.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran had previously listened to the second senior brother’s stories about the grievances and stories of their elders and found them somewhat exaggerated.</p>
<p>But now, looking at Shifu with his handsome eyebrows and starry eyes, she felt that it was quite possible for someone to lose their mind and slash someone’s face in order to compete for such an incredibly outrageous stunning man.</p>

<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>While lamenting, she once again affirmed in her heart that not only can appearance not be used as food, but sometimes it can also drive people crazy and stupid—it’s truly harmful without any benefit!</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t think she would make any great achievements in the path of immortal cultivation; she was just seeking to eliminate diseases and disasters. In the future, when she becomes healthy, she will go down the mountain to reunite with her parents and marry an honest and upright husband.</p>
<p>The husband she is looking for is probably a sturdy and honest man. Someone as handsome as her Shifu, she can’t have him, she doesn’t dare to! Otherwise, she would have to worry about getting her face slashed, and she wouldn’t even be at ease to enjoy eating anymore!</p>
<p>Ranran may be greedy for food, but she never reaches out to ask for food from others. Since her Shifu is like a peach offering on the immortal’s table, she naturally won’t even consider it since she can’t even touch the peach fuzz.</p>
<p>However, even though he is out of her league, it’s still a pleasure to have a look now and then…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>While she was lost in thought staring at her Shifu’s face, she absentmindedly picked up the little cat on the table that was showing off its prowess to her, and started to stroke its fur.</p>
<p>Although the cat was unwilling, the feeling of being kneaded on its chin and belly was too heavenly, and it gradually stopped meowing, just raising its paws and enjoying itself with squinted eyes.</p>
<p>Su Yishui didn’t remind his little disciple of her impropriety. After letting her stare at his face for a while, using his long finger, he gently pushed a cup of dark tea to her and said mildly, “Drink it.”</p>
<p>Ranran suddenly came back to her senses and picked up the tea cup with some embarrassment. However, as soon as she took a sip, the taste that was a hundred times more sour and astringent than medicinal soup rushed straight to her scalp from her taste buds.</p>
<p>She instinctively wanted to spit it out but Su Yishui elegantly tapped her neck lightly with his long fingers.</p>
<p>Ranran couldn’t control herself and swallowed the weird-tasting tea with a gulp.</p>
<p>Being a girl who has always valued eating, even when she was starving, she would never eat something bad tasting. After all, even simple ingredients can still taste good and delicious after careful preparation.</p>
<p>Radishes and green vegetables can also be enjoyed in eight different ways!</p>
<p>But what was that tea she just drank? Was it scooped out from a cesspool?</p>
<p>Ranran wanted to vomit, but she couldn’t. She just opened her eyes wide, and her aggrieved tears came running down, causing the cat in her arms to start licking her tears.</p>
<p>However, after licking for a while, the cat also seemed to be overwhelmed by the medicinal smell as well and quickly ran away with a meow.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Su Yishui knew that the tea would be hard to drink, but he didn’t expect her to be so picky that she would be upset enough to cry.</p>
<p>Although he once charmed women all over the world, it was obvious that the Immortal Su had no skills whatsoever in coaxing women. After frowning at her for a moment, he got up, picked an orange from the citrus tree beside him and handed it to his weeping disciple.</p>
<p>Ranran, although good-tempered, really couldn’t bear it right now. She didn’t take the orange, but choked out between sobs, “What did you give me to drink?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui’s hand froze there. He frowned, then slowly peeled the orange for her and handed the pieces of fruit back to her, “It contains a few herbs. As for what they are, it’s better for you not to know.”</p>
<p>Ranran’s imagination ran wild, thinking of all kinds of beetles, snakes, lizards, and even spiders and bugs. She became even more frightened and anxious, and said timidly, “Shifu, are you angry that my pill disrupted your three years of abstinence from food, so you are punishing me?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui slowly brought the piece of orange to her mouth and stuffed the fruit in. He tranquilly said, “This medicinal soup is beneficial to you, so it can’t be considered a punishment.”</p>
<p>The tea she drank just now had contained dried molt from a thousand-year-old Black Scaled Dragon—a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiaolong" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Scaled dragon</a> is a deep-sea water beast with a strong fishy smell. Drinking water boiled with the molt of this mythical beast can conceal five-element spiritual energy.</p>
<p>She is a spirit child who fell from the Reincarnation Tree. Even though her adoptive parents had deliberately obscured facts and reported her birth year incorrectly, anyone who has a connection with the Reincarnation Tree would recognize the wood spiritual energy on her.</p>
<p>By drinking this cup of Black Scaled Dragon brew, this early-fallen fruit can blend in with ordinary people without being recognized.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the side effect of this medicinal water are quite strong. For example, at the beginning, there will be a lingering fishy smell on the body. At this very moment, Xue Ranran feels that the smell on her body is unbearable.</p>
<p>Su Yishui didn’t seem to shun her. He even sat beside her and continued to feed her pieces of orange without batting an eye.</p>
<p>Ranran came back to her senses, refusing his feeding, but she accepted the orange even though she had no appetite.</p>
<p>“What…… were you thinking about when you were making that Qingxin Pill?” Su Yishui suddenly asked.</p>
<p>After overcoming the initial fishy smell, Ranran finally managed to calm down and said, “…I was thinking about meat buns…”</p>
<p>“And what else?”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran thought for a moment, and found that she couldn’t help but reveal her inner thoughts under his clear and water-like gaze, “I was also thinking… what does Shifu really look like, whether you are as good-looking as your bearing…”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Su Yishui didn’t reprimand her for being frivolous, but just asked quietly, “Are you satisfied with my appearance?”</p>
<p>Ranran shyly nodded her head—how could she just be satisfied? Having such a beautifully ethereal immortal as a Shifu is truly a blessing of three lifetimes!</p>
<p>Su Yishui seemed pleased. He also nodded and said to her, “Remember what I told you, don’t mention to anyone about me regaining my appearance and don’t talk about what I asked you to do on the mountain top.”</p>
<p>Ranran had already gotten used to her Shifu’s mysterious ways and just obediently acknowledged his instructions.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Although Shifu did not admit that he was punishing her, the fact remained that it definitely seemed like a punishment. Since coming down from the top of Xishan, the usually optimistic and cheerful Ranran had never felt so depressed.</p>
<p>Why did the delicious red bean cake taste like raw fish scales when it entered her mouth?</p>
<p>Afraid that the smell on her body would bother her senior brothers, Xue Ranran simply took sick leave and hid in her room without coming out.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t long before Gao Cang, Qiu Xier themselves couldn’t stand it anymore.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier said through the window to Ranran, who was hiding in her blanket, “Little junior sister, if you don’t come out to cook soon, we are all going to die on the path to immortality. Do you know? The Second Uncle Master has been feeding us radishes for three meals in a row. Those radishes are all burnt with a bitter taste, we really can’t take it anymore!”</p>
<p>Ranran replied in a muffled voice, “There are ingredients in the kitchen. If Second Uncle Master’s cooking is bad, you can cook for the senior brothers!”</p>
<p>Qiu Xi thought of Ranran’s braised meatballs and stir-fried sweet beets with almonds, and she couldn’t help but swallow her saliva. She couldn’t admit that her cooking skills were even worse than their second uncle Master, could she?</p>
<p>Fortunately, when Ranran woke up three days later, she suddenly found that the strange smell on her body had dissipated. She took out some dried sweet potatoes from her snack jar and ate a handful with relish, then sighed regretfully.</p>
<p>It is said that after forming a golden core and ascending after attaining a nascent soul, one can no longer distinguish the flavors of sour, sweet, bitter, and spicy. What was so great about immortality without any desires?</p>
<p>She couldn’t taste delicious foods on her tongue for just three days and already felt like dying. Would those immortal beings feel regret looking at the worldly pleasures when they see them?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But Ranran’s days of slacking off were over. Her Shifu finally came down from the top of the mountain. He ended his seclusion early and headed to Jueshan.</p>
<p>It seems that the commotion of the three major sects was useful after all. Su Yishui decided to take matters into his own hands and meet Wei Jiu in Jueshan.</p>
<p>Jueshan was Ranran’s hometown, so it was nice to go back and have a look. Before leaving, she even took the time to go down the mountain to see her parents.</p>
<p>Although it was just a brief meeting in a thatched resting shed at the foot of the mountain, it was all the more precious.</p>
<p>Qiaolian and her husband, Xue Liangui, had rented a shop in a nearby town. They sold beancurd for breakfast every morning. Carpenter Xue helped grind beans and tended the stove in the morning, and during the day, he went around to take on some odd jobs of repairing wooden utensils.</p>
<p>Although it was hard work, they earned more than when they were in Juefeng Village. Qiaolian could only see her daughter once a month, so the several packages she brought were always stuffed full.</p>
<p>Newly made flower jackets, quilts with new cotton wadding, all kinds of candied fruits and dried meat snacks, homemade salted vegetable shreds stir-fried with meat, plus salty duck eggs oozing with golden oils. If the food was not good, one can finish two bowls of rice with these.</p>
<p>Since she didn’t know what the meals were like on the mountain, Qiaolian was afraid her darling daughter would be hungry there.</p>
<p>When she heard that Ranran was going to Jueshan with Master Su, Qiaolian and her husband also wanted to go.</p>
<p>However, Ranran said that her Shifu was also going to teach them the technique of riding the wind on this trip, so they would be walking all the way, which would probably be very exhausting.</p>
<p>Moreover, with so many young disciples of the same age from the sect, if she is the only one bringing her parents, it might make her seniors feel resentful.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Qiaolian felt a pang of heartache again. If it weren’t for seeing her daughter looking like a sprout nourished by immortal dew, with her cheeks becoming plump and growing much taller, she really wanted to take her daughter home immediately.</p>
<p>Qiaolian secretly instructed her daughter not to take cultivating and learning the way of the Tao too seriously. After all, Ranran would still have to leave the sect to get married in the future. If she was tired, she should plead with her Shifu and pay for a donkey with her own money to rest her feet.</p>
<p>Saying this, she also stuffed the three taels of silver that her daughter had specifically received from the second uncle master back into her arms, telling her not to make herself suffer when she was away from home.</p>
<p>Ranran naturally refused to take it back, but Qiaolian was somewhat annoyed, “Your father and I have hands and feet and we earn enough money now. As the old saying goes, ‘A family should be frugal but bring more money on a journey!’ If you have more silver on you, your father and I can be more at ease!”</p>
<p>Thus, Ranran could only keep it, but she wouldn’t spend it. She wanted to save money to build a big house for her parents.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The carpenter couple couldn’t enter the mountain, so Ranran had to carry the things back by herself. The packages were too heavy. Her steps up the mountain gradually slowed down.</p>
<p>Fortunately, her senior brothers Gao Cang and Bai Baishan “just happened” to go down the mountain for a stroll and helped their junior sister carry things.</p>
<p>When young men and women are together, even if there is no exchange of glances, some feelings of affection and ambiguity will arise.</p>
<p>Apart from the stingy second uncle master on the mountain, there were only two girls, Qiu Xier and Xue Ranran. Although Qiu Xier was not ugly, she had a chronic heart disease, her lips were slightly purple and her figure was not very graceful.</p>
<p>Ranran, who had recovered a bit, had red lips and white teeth and her bright eyes were full of charm. Such a graceful young girl, wouldn’t every gentleman would want to try to pursue her?</p>
<p>Gao Cang was still naive and only knows that he feels very happy when he saw his junior sister, and his voice unconsciously raised when he spoke.</p>
<p>The second senior brother Bai Baishan, who was well-versed in human affairs, although he joked with Qiu Xier, he would also specially look at Xue Ranran to see if she looked at him with adoring eyes after he showed off his knowledge of immortal history and legends.</p>
<p>Now that he had the opportunity to show off in front of his junior sister, both senior brothers were very diligent.</p>
<p>Gao Cang rolled up his sleeves, revealing his strong and firm muscles. He carried all the packages on his body like a strutting rooster, walking briskly in front of Ranran.</p>
<p>Bai Baishan was beside his junior sister, from time to time telling her about some comical moments from their cultivation practice, making Ranran smile in delight.</p>
<p>The scene of two young men and a young girl frolicking and chasing each other in the mountains was indeed pleasing to the eye.</p>
<p>At least to Yu Tong, who was standing halfway up the mountain, felt as if she had returned to twenty years ago when Lingxi Palace had been full of handsome young men.</p>
<p>Feeling nostalgic, she couldn’t help but mutter to herself, “Xishan has been quiet for too long, even the birds haven’t heard such hearty laughter for a long time…”</p>
<p>Her Master, who was standing in front of her, was also looking down the mountain—the considerate female disciple was taking out her handkerchief to wipe the sweat from her senior brother’s forehead!</p>

<p>By rights, a harmonious relationship among the disciples should be comforting to the Master.</p>
<p>However, when Gao Cang and the others climbed to the top of the mountain with smiles on their faces, they found their Shifu standing in the middle of the mountain path, wearing an ebony wooden mask, looking at them with a stern gaze.</p>
<p>The joyful atmosphere immediately dissipated. They quickly bowed to greet their Shifu.</p>
<p>But Su Yishui’s mouth seemed to have melted as well, standing in the middle of the road, silent for a long while.</p>
<p>At this point, Gao Cang and Bai Baishan secretly glanced at each other, wondering if their Shifu was angry.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran stood behind her two senior brothers, was only able to tiptoe and look over their shoulders at their Shifu.</p>
<p>Now their Shifu no longer wore a veil, but always wore a dark mask that covered most of his face, and his tightly pursed lips did not reveal any emotions.</p>
<p>Just as the young disciples were feeling uneasy, Su Yishui slowly spoke and asked the two male disciples, “Xue Ranran went down the mountain to visit her mother, why did you two follow?”</p>
<p>Gao Cang honestly said, “We were worried that our little junior sister would get tired, so we specially helped her carry her things.”</p>
<p>Su Yishui nodded and said, “Helping fellow disciples… very good. However, if you had been diligent in your studies, you should have some foundation in your footwork by now. Why then did you walk so slowly when climbing the mountain? Go, exchange the baggage in your hands for a sandbag weighing twenty jin and climb up and down twenty times.”</p>
<p>Hearing their Shifu’s words, both senior brothers wailed in unison.</p>
<p>Although Xishan is not very high, it is extremely steep, and it takes a lot of effort to climb up and down once. But now, their Shifu told them to carry a sandbag up and down twenty times, which is very likely to kill them of exhaustion halfway up the mountain.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran listened to this and felt that the sudden misfortune of her two senior brothers was related to helping her carry her things.</p>
<p>So she softly pleaded on the side, “It’s my fault for asking the two senior brothers for help…”</p>
<p>Although the two senior brothers actually came uninvited, they were kind-hearted but ended up in such a tragic state. Ranran wanted to plead for them.</p>
<p>However, Su Yishui flatly said, “Oh. And you, spending more time in the kitchen than in the alchemy room every day. I remember that I accepted a disciple, not a cook. Go! Copy the alchemy formula three times. If you can’t finish copying before we set off, take the stationery with you and write while we’re on the road!”</p>
<p>Copying that thick alchemy formula book once, would take three days.</p>
<p>Now, all three disciples kept their mouths shut, and dejectedly went up the mountain. They then proceeded to receive their punishment individually.</p>
<p>Although Xue Ranran felt a bit down initially by the punishment, but upon further thought, she realized that her Shifu’s words was very reasonable.</p>
<p>Her senior sister Qiu Xi had already started refining a higher-level pill, the Calming Pill, and she hadn’t even touched the alchemy cauldron yet!</p>
<p>Thinking this way, she willingly accepted the punishment. While copying and learning the medicinal formulas by heart, she could take the opportunity to practice her calligraphy and revise her homework, so her mood actually improved as she was writing. When Yu Tong passed by the study, she even heard the young girl humming a tune from Jueshan.</p>
<p>That clear and soft voice was sweet to the ears.</p>
<p>Yu Tong smiled as she looked through the window, but the sight of the girl propping her chin with one hand and writing elegantly made her feel like she was in a daydream. She felt the scene was somewhat familiar, but she couldn’t pinpoint which part of her distant memories it was from…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When it was time for dinner, the two brothers who had climbed the mountain, left half alive, staggered into the dining hall and struggled to get to the dining table.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran, who had written too much, felt a bit sore in her wrist when holding chopsticks. Fortunately, it was the Second uncle master Yu Tong who was the main cook today, so there was no regret even if she ate a few bites less. She just closed her eyes and swallowed a few mouthfuls of white rice to satisfy her hunger.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it seemed that someone couldn’t put up with just that.</p>
<p>Since returning from his seclusion on the mountain top, their respected teacher Su Yishui had not yet recovered his cultivation from breaking his fast. He had already shared several meals with them. His appetite was not small, and he was quite particular regarding the variety of dishes.</p>
<p>For example, fish should not be eaten with raw items, and the knife work for cutting meat should not be done along the grain of the meat, and so on.</p>
<p>But today’s meal was not prepared by Ranran. Yu Tong’s cooking skills, which could make ghosts cry, turned a plate of stir fried green vegetables into a charred mess.</p>
<p>When not abstaining from eating, the immortal Su was quite particular about his food. After only one bite, he refused to try any other dishes and asked Ranran, “Which one did you make?”</p>
<p>Ranran bit her chopsticks and timidly said, “Shifu, didn’t you criticize me for not being diligent and forbade me to enter the kitchen?”</p>
<p>After being reminded by his little disciple, Su Yishui paused for a moment. He then put down his chopsticks and left the dining hall with big strides, his expression hidden behind the dark mask.</p>
<p>Yu Tong was quite distressed and muttered to herself, “What should I do? I just don’t know how to cook. If the Master doesn’t abstain from meals and he can’t enjoy his three meals a day, what should I do?”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran now suspected that Su Yishui’s previous abstention from meals was forced by Yu Tong’s cooking skills.</p>
<p>However, seeing the second uncle master so upset, Ranran still gently comforted her. Perhaps Shifu was preoccupied about going to Jueshan to have a decisive battle with the demonic cultivator Wei Jiu, which is why he had no appetite.</p>
<p>By the side, Yu Chen snorted coldly and said, “If the Master had not used his Golden Core to attract souls and wasted twenty years in vain, even ten Wei Jius would not be a match for him!”</p>
<p>Qiu Xier listened and asked nervously, “Does that mean that our Shifu can’t beat Wei Jiu now? Then… aren’t we going to our deaths if we go?”</p>
<p>Yu Chen slammed the table and said, “How could he not beat him? You’re underestimating the teacher, which is a great disrespect! He is a genius in cultivating immortality who formed his Golden Core at the age of sixteen! And the righteous path of cultivating immortality is to exorcise demons and save the world! In the face of evil demons, how can we be cowardly and afraid of death?”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran listened with wide eyes: When she initially sought to learn from a teacher, it was just for survival. If she had known that cultivating immortality also involved putting one’s life on the line, she should have considered it more carefully before becoming a disciple.</p>
<p>Her mother said she still had to leave the mountain and get married in the future!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even though Su Yishui had abandoned the old rules of Lingxi Palace, when she first became a disciple, he emphasized one point: it’s easy to enter Xishan, but hard to leave.</p>
<p>Once you become a disciple, unless you are expelled by the teacher, there is no way to give up halfway.</p>
<p>As for what consequences there would be if one wanted to retreat and escape halfway, Shifu didn’t say. However, at that time, when they were meditating under the tree in the grass hall, a poisonous snake suddenly crawled onto the grass mat. The teacher flicked his finger lightly and the poisonous snake instantly turned into ash and dissipated in the breeze…</p>
<p>So Xue Ranran felt that if she wanted to repent and flee halfway, she would probably end up like that snake, without even a chance to become a bowl of snake soup.</p>
<p>In any case, no one can back down on the path of exorcising demons and eliminating evil.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Su Yishui seemed to be aware that he was going against the odds and so he did not seem to be in a hurry to go to his death. He took his time until almost the end of the month before setting off.</p>
<p>It’s unclear where he spent the thousands of gold taels from his medical consults. They did not even have a donkey cart when they set out.</p>
<p>It seemed that in consideration of the frailty of his two female disciples, he finally bought a horse when they passed through a village so that the two female disciples could sit on horseback to rest their feet.</p>
<p>As for the others, they all carried their baggage and wore bamboo hats, braving the wind and rain to move forward.</p>
<p>In Ranran’s large water bag was the root tea brewed by her Shifu, the same kind that cost a tael of gold per cup when she first arrived at Xishan. Every morning after getting up, her quiet Shifu would remind her to drink her medicine every time.</p>
<p>Ranran couldn’t help but feel touched. Although her Shifu was strict on a daily basis, he was considerate of his disciples. If he encountered an accident in the future during a confrontation, she, as a disciple, would definitely show filial piety by his sickbed, pull weeds in front of his grave, set up a memorial tablet, and burn incense, never abandoning him!</p>
<p>Su Yishui seemed very relaxed. He did not seem like he was going to exorcise demons, but more like a geomancer exploring dragon veins and burial grounds. Along the way, he would look at a rusty compass from time to time.</p>
<p>Later, when they passed through a forest of Scholar trees, Su Yishui stopped and instructed them to set up camp at the edge of the forest to rest for the night.</p>
<p>At night, after Su Yishui took a walk in the forest, he called Ranran, who was roasting sweet potatoes by the fire, to come with him again into the Scholar tree forest shrouded in the night.</p>
<p>Listening to the strange calls of night owls in the forest and seeing Su Yishui’s steps that seem unwilling to stop, Ranran felt somewhat uneasy.</p>
<p>After all, even if they were teacher and disciple, it was still rather improper for a man and a woman to enter the forest together at night. Just as Ranran was thinking about how to politely suggest to her Shifu that they should go back, Su Yishui stopped, turned around, and took off his mask.</p>
<p>With the full moon hanging high and the clear moonlight pouring through the trees, Ranran suddenly felt relieved seeing his indescribably handsome face and thought: It turns out that good looks are useful after all. At least when committing a crime, it makes others feel less hateful.</p>
<p>As she was staring at her Shifu and letting her thoughts run wild, Su Yishui took out a brocade bag and said to her, “Plant these seeds in the forest for me.”</p>
<p>Ranran took the bag and poured dozens of flat round seeds into her hand, but she couldn’t tell what kind of plant they were.</p>
<p>However, she followed her Shifu’s instructions and did as she was told.</p>
<p>After instructing her to plant the seeds under eight different trees, Su Yishui picked a large rock to sit on with his legs crossed, seemingly getting ready to absorb the essence of the moonlight.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t close his eyes, he just watched the girl digging holes and planting seeds while muttering to herself.</p>
<p>“Sleep well, drink water, and grow quickly!” her mouth formed a sweet smile and she seemed to be earnestly taking care of a group of helpless children.</p>
<p>Just as Ranran buried the last seed and was about to stand up, she suddenly realized that her Shifu, who was sitting down before, had been standing right behind her from an unknown time.</p>
<p>She bumped into her Shifu’s very broad chest when she turned around, causing her nose to feel a bit sore.</p>
<p>“Shifu..” She rubbed her nose and called out softly. Su Yishui looked down at her slightly tearing eyes, became silent for a while. His gaze was so focused as if something was about to surge out, but in the end, he said nothing again, turned and left.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The next morning after they had planted the seeds in the forest, they set off again.</p>
<p>Since they took their time and didn’t rush, it took them a full five days to reach Juefeng Village again.</p>
<p>The usually quiet village was bustling like a town these days.</p>
<p>In addition to the disciples of the three major sects and Wei Jiu’s sect, many other small and large cultivation sects also sent people.</p>
<p>The incident caused by Mu Qingge in the past stirred up a huge wave between the cultivation and demonic cultivation worlds. Now that the female demon will be reborn again, it naturally attracted attention. The great powers all wanted to know if the reincarnated spiritual fruit had repented and returned to the path of righteousness.</p>
<p>If she chose to join forces with Wei Jiu after she arrives, it would be a waste of the chance of reincarnation given by the heavens, and the righteous path would definitely unite to execute her.</p>
<p>Perhaps because the fruit was about to ripen and fall, a very domineering shield automatically formed around Jueshan’s Immortal Platform, preventing anyone from approaching. No one knew when it would fall, so they could only wait at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>However, there were only so many houses in the village. Although many of the great cultivators were not short of money, there were too many people, all divided into different sects, and unwilling to share a house. Those who came later and couldn’t rent a house had to endure the elements and sleep outdoors.</p>
<p>But Su Yishui’s disciple is from the village. Moreover, since Qiaolian left in a hurry, the house was not rented out yet. So they naturally went to stay at the Xues’ house.</p>
<p>However, when they arrived at the front door, Ranran found that the originally locked door was open, and it seemed that someone had already moved into her yard.</p>

<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Ranran was somewhat surprised. When she was about to push the door open to enter, Su Yishui pulled the back of her collar and made her stand behind him.</p>
<p>After Su Yishui pushed the door open, Ranran tiptoed to look over her Shifu’s shoulder and saw that it was the disciples of the Kongshan Sect sitting in her yard.</p>
<p>Because Wen Hongshan, the woman with the scar on her face, was also startled when she saw Su Yishui pushing the door open.</p>
<p>Since Su Yishui was wearing a mask, she naturally couldn’t recognize him at first. But when she saw Yu Chen and Yu Tong next to him and took a closer look at his figure, she recognized him.</p>
<p>Wen Hongshan’s voice trembled slightly as she softly said, “Yishui, you’ve finally come.”</p>
<p>At this moment, Ranran stood next to her teacher, looking at the Kongshan Sect disciples filling the courtyard, she thought that since Master Wen almost became her Shifu’s wife, she decided to ease up on her questioning tone.</p>
<p>She stole a glance at her Shifu beside her, to see if he wanted to catch up with Master Wen.</p>
<p>However, her Shifu, wearing a mask, looked indifferent, as if he didn’t want to take the initiative to greet her.</p>
<p>Instead, Wen Hongshan couldn’t hide an uncontrollable look of joy on her face and said, “How did you know I was here? What do you want with me…”</p>
<p>Just then, Grandmother Huang, the neighbor next door, came over enthusiastically, grabbing Ranran and saying, “Oh, Ranran, how come you’re back? Where are your parents?”</p>
<p>Ranran politely greeted Grandmother Huang and explained that she had come back alone. She then asked, “Grandmother Huang, may I know why are there are people in my house?”</p>
<p>At this, Grandmother Huang looked a bit embarrassed, but thinking that Ranran was young and easy to fool, she smiled and said, “Recently, many people have come to rent houses, offering a lot of gold and silver. I thought it was a pity that your house was empty, so I rented it out for you. I’ll give the rent to your mother when I see her… Miss Wen doesn’t like being disturbed by outsiders. Are you going to stay for a few days? My empty house is also rented out… How about staying with me?”</p>
<p>Although Ranran was young, she was very clever and observant. She understood right away – Wen Hongshan had rented the house at a high price, and with no more houses to rent, Grandmother Huang had set her sights on their yard, opened the lock without permission and rented the house to the Kongshan Sect.</p>
<p>Realizing this, Ranran’s tone became less polite. She smiled and asked Grandmother Huang, “When my mother left, I don’t think she asked you to help take care of the house and rent it out. And how did you open the door without the key since the lock is so big?”</p>
<p>Grandmother Huang was at a loss for words and couldn’t think of a reply. Yu Chen, who had once received a bucket of slop from this old woman, was not very polite either and said, “Breaking into someone’s house is a violation of the law. I don’t think it’s as simple as just returning the rent.”</p>
<p>At this moment, Su Yishui, who had been silent, spoke up: “Miss Wen, the homeowner is back. Please move out with your people.”</p>
<p>Wen Hongshan had been listening to the situation from the side and realized that Grandmotehr Huang had rented out someone else’s house without permission. If that was the case, it could be easily resolved, perhaps just by paying double the original rent as compensation.</p>
<p>But she never expected that the young girl who is the homeowner had not yet spoken, but Su Yishui would be the first to ask them to leave.</p>
<p>Wen Hongshan realized that she had been mistaken. Su Yishui had not come to find her at all.</p>
<p>Her heart that was burning with hope, was doused with cold water. Wen Hongshan bit her lower lip and then turned to Ranran, saying, “I’m really sorry, young lady. Since we’ve already moved in, it’s really not convenient to move again. How about this? I’ll double the original rent as compensation.”</p>
<p>Ranran felt it was not appropriate for her to interfere in her Shifu’s old romantic affairs, so she decided to pass the hot potato to her teacher.</p>
<p>She replied obediently, “I don’t mind, but my Shifu doesn’t have a place to stay now either. As his disciple, I should offer my own house for my teacher, uncles, and brothers to stay in… Otherwise, you can ask my Shifu if he is willing to share the courtyard with you.”</p>
<p>Misunderstandings and quarrels between lovers are common. Ranran had often seen scenes of young men and women bickering in the village when she used to peek over walls.</p>
<p>If there were misunderstandings, it would be good to clear them up. As a disciple, she naturally wanted to help her Shifu bridge the gap, hoping to reunite the once-lovers and create a beautiful story of an immortal couple.</p>
<p>The path was laid out, just waiting for her Shifu to nod and take the easy way out.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, when Wen Hongshan looked at her Shifu with hope, the man wearing the mask coldly said, “Yu Chen, see the guests out!”</p>
<p>Yu Chen has always obeyed his master, so he waved his hands at the Kongshan Sect disciples in the courtyard, saying, “Please move, go and get the rent from that old woman who broke into the house!”</p>
<p>Ranran sneaked a glance at Wen Hongshan, only to see her very pale, looking utterly disappointed as she muttered, “Yishui, you still refuse to forgive me? I… didn’t mean to deceive you back then…”</p>
<p>Su Yishui didn’t say anything else, clearly unwilling to say another word.</p>
<p>At this moment, the disciples of the Kongshan Sect behind her started to make a fuss, “We were here first, why should we give up the house to you!”</p>
<p>But Wen Hongshan said, “Shut up, all of you, follow me out!”</p>
<p>After regaining some dignity as the Elder of the Kongshan Sect, she led her disciples away with a grim face, one of whom dragged Grandmother Huang by the collar to her house to demand their rent back.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t bother with Grandmother Huang, who was complaining about the lack of respect from the neighbors. After securing the main door, she went straight to her own room.</p>
<p>Perhaps the disciples of the Kongshan Sect thought they had paid for the place and treated it like an inn, leaving it in a mess without bothering to clean up.</p>
<p>She had always been tidy since she was young and didn’t like to share bedding with others. But now that her bedding had been used by others, she had no choice but to take apart the quilt covers and sheets for washing to avoid any lingering odors.</p>
<p>Su Yishui sat in a wicker chair in the courtyard, watching his little disciple in an apron with her sleeves tied up bustling about. One moment she was sweeping the floor, sprinkling water, and later bundling up a pile of sheets to be washed.</p>
<p>But the thin arms that had just gained a bit of flesh struggled with the laundry bat in the big basin, washing the sheets.</p>
<p>Earlier, Su Yishui had sent Yu Chen and Yu Tong to the foot of Jue Mountain to gather information, while Gao Cang and the others cleaned the house where Shifu was going to stay.</p>
<p>Their Shifu and the little junior sister seemed to share the same habit of not being comfortable living in a place with traces of others and needing a thorough cleaning.</p>
<p>After watching his little disciple struggle with the laundry for a while, Su Yishui casually asked, “If you wash all the sheets and quilt covers, what will you use tonight?”</p>
<p>Ranran looked up and wiped her sweat, saying, “My mother gave me a thick jacket, I’ll use it as a cover to sleep tonight.”</p>
<p>She paused and asked her Shifu, “I’ve washed all the sheets in the two rooms, do you have anything to cover with tonight?”</p>
<p>Although her Shifu didn’t seem to sleep much while in Yongcheng’s Xishan, he must want to rest well with the big battle imminent.</p>
<p>Thinking that her Shifu didn’t have any warm clothes, she quickly got up and went back to her room, took out her little flower jacket and handed it to Su Yishui, “How about, you can cover with this tonight. I’m young and resistant to the cold, sleeping in my clothes is fine.”</p>
<p>Faced with his disciple’s filial piety, Su Yishui was not appreciative. He looked at the rustic pink jacket and said flatly, “Are you saying that I’m very old?”</p>
<p>Um… How to answer without offending the teacher-student relationship?</p>
<p>If calculated by the age of ordinary mortals, her Shifu should be in his late thirties, right?</p>
<p>For cultivators, surpassing the life and death of mortals, being in their thirties and forties is just the beginning of their journey, so they can be considered youthful.</p>
<p>Moreover, her Shifu has the technique of maintaining his appearance. Pretending to be an eighteen or nineteen-year-old youth is no problem at all. It is true that he can hardly be associated with the elderly.</p>
<p>Ranran has always been likable since she was young, with a good affinity for elders, but she found that she couldn’t please her Shifu no matter what. Her Shifu seemed always be quick to find faults in her words.</p>
<p>Just as Ranran was thinking about how to compliment her Shifu’s handsome youthful appearance without violating the first rule of the sect, he instead stood up and said, “Let’s go, let’s go to the nearby market to buy some quilts.”</p>
<p>Qiu Xier was overjoyed to hear about going to the market, so the little disciples quickly got ready and followed Su Yishui out.</p>
<p>The market in town sells local specialties from nearby villages, but even the somewhat mediocre goods couldn’t stop the joy of shopping.</p>
<p>The youngsters like Gao Cang, Qiu Xier all bought various snacks and drinks. Ranran, as the big spender with three taels of silver, was somewhat reluctant to part with her money, spending most of her time watching others eat.</p>
<p>Su Yishui stopped in front of a ready-made clothing store and said to Ranran, who was following him in a pink floral jacket, “Let the tailor take your measurements and make a new dress for you.”</p>
<p>Ranran felt that her teacher was giving her a surprise test again, to see if she was extravagant and wasteful. She immediately smoothly replied, “Shifu, I have enough clothes. There’s no need for new ones.”</p>
<p>Behind the mask, a pair of critical eyes scrutinized the pink, rustic-looking girl in front of him. Su Yishui calmly said, “Change to something plain. It’s too garish for the eyes…”</p>
<p>Being repulsed by her Shifu, Ranran had no choice but to remain silent. But she thought her clothes were very pretty, specially made for her with the floral fabric picked by her mother!</p>
<p>However, young girls naturally like colorful clothes. Seeing Ranran getting lost in the pile of colorful fabrics, Su Yishui seemed unable to bear it any longer and personally stepped in to pick out some fabric for his disciple.</p>
<p>He rejected those gaudy rural colors and chose a piece of moon-white fabric. He also steered clear of the tailor’s eagerly offered dress designs, directly drew the style of the long robes he wanted, and instructed the tailor to make it accordingly.</p>
<p>Of course, as a teacher, he treated everyone equally. Gao Cang, Bai Baishan, and Qiu Xier also each had a garment made in the same style.</p>
<p>Because Su Yishui was very generous, the tailor turned a blind eye to his strange mask, smiling broadly and assuring that he would find more seamstresses so that the clothes could be delivered to their village abode by the afternoon of the next day for the brilliant disciples.</p>
<p>In addition to clothes, there were also small items like hairpins for the girls, all personally selected by Su Yishui. However, the prices of these items left them speechless.</p>
<p>According to the shopkeeper, these were precious items brought in from the capital, but because the place was small and no one recognized their value, they had not been sold.</p>
<p>Ranran silently watched her Shifu spend money like water, feeling that the rules of the former Lingxi Palace had a successor. Although her Shifu did not voice out his particular nature, he truly inherited the extravagant style of the female demon.</p>
<p>When he became fastidious, everything about clothing, food, accommodation and travel had to be of high quality. It was said by the second uncle master in a vague manner that he was the son of a Prince, raised in luxury and wealth, so it was no wonder that when he did become particular, he wouldn’t settle for anything less.</p>

<p>Of course, she didn’t dare to speak such rebellious words out loud; she could only grumble quietly in her heart.</p>
<p>When the new clothes arrived, Ranran couldn’t help but admire her Shifu’s elegant taste. The seemingly simple moon-white robe, once worn, gave a sense of being as graceful as a fairy.</p>
<p>She unconsciously took off the pink floral hairpin from her head, re-combed her hair into a simple hair bun and put on the newly bought jade hairpin. Looking at herself in the mirror again, she suddenly felt as if she was exuding an immortal aura, and that her cultivation had improved significantly. She could surely refine the elixir of immortality if she started brewing now!</p>
<p>However, Qiu Xier, who was a bit chubby, was quite dissatisfied because the loose and casual moon-white robe didn’t suit her slightly plump figure, and no matter how she adjusted it, she couldn’t achieve the slender and graceful look that Ranran had.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier was very self conscious of her looks and didn’t want to wear it, but the second uncle master said that they were going to meet with fellow cultivators at Jue Mountain the next day.</p>
<p>At that time, disciples from every cultivation sect would wear their uniforms. Since their Shifu had tailor-made clothes for them, they had to dress neatly and not disgrace the reputation of Xishan immortal cultivators of Yongcheng.</p>
<p>On the day they had gone to the market, their two uncle masters went around to gather information. They briefly described the situation under Jue Mountain when they came back.</p>
<p>Some people from the righteous sects had already thought of a way to deal with Mu Qingge. It was said that Kongshan Sect had a Dragon Abyss used to imprison Jiao dragons. Once someone fell into it and was bound by iron chains, it was very difficult to escape from.</p>
<p>The head of Kongshan Sect, Wen Shitai, was the first to declare that no one should covet Mu Qingge’s cultivation. Although Mu Qingge had been reincarnated, which was a chance given by heaven, she had not made any mistakes in this life. It would be somewhat unreasonable to execute her, but to prevent her from causing chaos in the world again, once she was born, everyone would join forces to capture her and imprison her in Dragon Abyss, never to be reborn!</p>
<p>Other sects seemed not very interested in Wen Shitai’s proposal, and few responded, as everyone had their own plans.</p>
<p>The demonic cultivator Wei Jiu would pay no attention to Wen Shitai. His disciples had already occupied the northwest of the mountain, while the three major sects occupied the southeast. The two camps were ready for a battle at any moment.</p>
<p>The words of the uncle masters made all the young disciples quite nervous and unable to sleep.</p>
<p>The next day, before dawn, a sudden explosive sound came from the top of Jue Mountain. A beam of spiritual light shot up into the sky, breaking through layers of morning clouds and mist.</p>
<p>This tumultuous sound was quite earth-shattering. The next moment, cultivators who were staying in the village leaped out of their houses, lightly tapped their toes, silently recited the wind-riding spell to rush towards the mountain top.</p>
<p>However, there were also inexperienced young cultivators with shallow cultivation. Their shoes and leggings were not tightly tied, and the flying shoes that were flung off in a hurry were quite a spectacle!</p>
<p>Uncle master Yu Chen and Gao Cang felt that a big battle was imminent and their blood started to boil. They shouted and wanted to fly up to join them.</p>
<p>But Su Yishui stopped them and then turned to ask Ranran, “Is breakfast ready?”</p>
<p>Just out of bed, Ranran had slept in her clothes last night. She did not even dare to undress, fearing that she might need to rush up the mountain in a hurry during the night.</p>
<p>Hearing her Shifu suddenly asking for breakfast, she let out an “Ah” and hurriedly nodded.</p>
<p>Ever since the second uncle master Yu Tong made a few meals with strange flavors, the task of cooking somehow inexplicably fell back on Ranran.</p>
<p>Ranran always prepared the food the night before going to bed. In the morning, she could warm up porridge and small dishes and they could eat.</p>
<p>So, amidst the shouting and the flying of various cultivators in the sky, the seven disciples of Xishan Sect of Yongcheng sat around a table in the small courtyard of the Xue family, slurping hot porridge and peeling five-spice eggs…</p>
<p>Yu Tong’s concentration was always better than her brother’s, but seeing her master’s calm demeanor, she couldn’t help but remind him, “Master, if we arrive late and Mu Qingge is captured by Wei Jiu, or if she is executed, wouldn’t you lose the chance to restore your appearance…”</p>
<p>But Ranran knew that her Shifu had already restored his appearance and was not in a hurry at all.</p>
<p>She also felt that this was very well. As a person of the righteous path, if they didn’t show up, they would inevitably be criticized by others. However, if they charged ahead, they would inevitably be putting their lives on the line.</p>
<p>Shifu was so composed and steady, not being a show-off, filled with the solidity and reliability of being both a person and a cultivator, which was admirable in every way!</p>
<p>So she attentively served some side dishes to her Shifu, letting the honored master eat a bit more, so that when walking up the mountain later, his dantian would also be warmer.</p>
<p>But the eldest senior brother, Gao Cang, was full of passion for cultivating the true way and was so eager that he secretly signaled to Ranran to let their Shifu eat faster. If they were late, wouldn’t they completely miss those on the demonic path?</p>
<p>Ranran tried to lower her eyelids as much as possible, pretending not to see, and buried her face in her bowl of hot porridge with shrimp pieces.</p>
<p>After finally finishing breakfast, Su Yishui calmly got up and took his disciples, dressed in their new clothes, to the mountain for a fight.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier looked at her own clothes with some reluctance. Although they didn’t look good, they were made of precious fabric. What should she do if blood splashed on them later and it couldn’t be washed off?</p>
<p>As rookies who had just entered the sect, she and Ranran had no power to resist the enemy at all. They only had invisibility pills given by their Shifu in their arms. If the situation gets out of control later on, they could just take the pills and make a quick escape.</p>
<p>With the pills at arms reach, Ranran felt slightly more at ease. She was curious about the withered tree on the old mountain of her hometown, and even more curious about what the demonic revered Grandmaster, Mu Qingge, who had been reborn as a human, would look like.</p>
<p>By the time they reached the middle of the mountain, the shouts of killing were already shaking the sky. They saw disciples of the Crimson Gate in black robes all over the mountain, apparently determined to obtain the spiritual fruit that had landed.</p>
<p>The experts of the three major sects also joined the battle, fighting against a man in a black robe embroidered with gold threads and a gentle appearance in the air. The scene was extremely tragic.</p>
<p>Listening to Yu Chen’s commentary on the side, that man who was giving everyone a thrashing was the demonic cultivator Wei Jiu.</p>
<p>He was on the cusp of forming a Nascent Soul and was the person with the highest cultivation in the demonic cultivator world in a hundred years. He was good at using a pair of Qilin Demon Blade Hooks. Wherever the hooks went, flesh and blood flew and spiritual power was shattered.</p>
<p>After losing more than a dozen powerful disciples, all three major sects retreated. Right now, they were in a tight spot.</p>
<p>Wei Fang of the Jiuhua Sect had one arm sliced by that hook and was bloodied and unable to move. The head of the Jiuhua Sect, Kaiyuan Zhenren, stood in the front of the team, watching the battle in the sky with a grave face.</p>
<p>Just then, Wei Fang inadvertently turned his head and saw Su Yishui and the others coming leisurely. He immediately excitedly shouted at Wei Jiu on the mountain top: “Demon Wei! Your nemesis, Su Yishui, is here!”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu had been waiting for the spiritual shield of the Jue Mountain to disappear for a long time.</p>
<p>But as he led his disciples up the mountain when the spiritual shield disappeared, the righteous sects that had been lying in ambush all came up to kill him, like cockroaches and bugs. Although they were insignificant, they were extremely annoying.</p>
<p>Finally, when he had driven them back, he suddenly heard such a shout. He raised his eyebrows, looked in the direction of the sound, and indeed saw his old enemy, Su Yishui.</p>
<p>Back then, he had wanted to enter the sect of Mu Qingge and had knelt in front of Yongcheng Xishan’s mountain gate for one day and night. However, Mu Qingge only glanced at him and casually dismissed him with the words, “There is no master and disciple fate, do not force it.”</p>
<p>But after that, Mu Qingge went out of her way and did everything she could, to forcibly take Su Yishui, a disciple from another sect, under her wing.</p>
<p>This dumped a bucket of cold water on his zeal at that time.</p>
<p>People had always said that Mu Qingge liked to take in beautiful orphans as disciples. He was an orphan without parents and his appearance was impeccable. Why did Mu Qingge show undisguised disdain when she looked at him?</p>
<p>And that Su Yishui was not even an orphan at all. He was the illegitimate son of the once powerful Prince Ping, a noble child raised privately in luxury. But he had been favored by Mu Qingge, who taught him everything she knew!</p>
<p>It would seem that no matter how high one’s cultivation is, it is hard to escape the worldly practice of being a snob!</p>
<p>From then on, the already radical Wei Jiu became even more bitter, so he turned to the Crimson Gate to practice demonic cultivation. Along this path, he endured hardships and even committed the act of killing his master and stealing his cultivation, all for the sake of forming a Nascent Soul as soon as possible. Because he wanted to let Mu Qingge see what kind of genius she had missed back then. He also wanted to make Mu Qingge taste regret.</p>
<p>But he believed that when Mu Qingge was besieged by the three major righteous sects, she must have regretted it, right? Taking in a rebellious traitor like Su Yishui was truly digging her own grave!</p>
<p>Now hearing the shout of the Jiuhua Sect disciple, could it be that the world still thought that he, Wei Jiu, that his abilities were still below Su Yishui’s?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Wei Jiu couldn’t help but laugh loudly. He then leaped up, charging straight towards Su Yishui.</p>
<p>The Qilin Double Hooks shone with cold light, bringing a force of a thousand pounds fiercely. If struck, muscles and bones in the entire body would shatter and the spiritual power would also be greatly damaged.</p>
<p>Looking at Su Yishui, he showed no intention of fighting back and stood calmly in the wind.</p>
<p>When Wei Jiu attacked, he did not dodge, but simply took out a piece of black wooden square plaque and held it up high.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that the people around would break into a cold sweat for Su Yishui. Yu Chen was even more than eager to rush up to block the fatal blow for his master.</p>
<p>Who would have thought that when Wei Jiu saw the intricate carvings on the plaque, he suddenly pulled back his attack. As he turned around, he asked in a low voice with furrowed brows, “Is what you have in your hand the key to the spiritual spring of the underworld?”</p>
<p>As soon as he said this, the people who heard it paled in fear – the spiritual spring of the underworld was previously just a legend in the cultivation world, but Mu Qingge had turned the legend into reality. She not only broke into the underworld, found the spiritual spring, but also released the demon child that brought disaster to the world.</p>
<p>The underworld is not the land of the dead as discussed by ordinary mortals and the spiritual spring contains the source of endless extreme yin spiritual power. Su Yishui, who accompanied Mu Qingge into the underworld at that time, gained a great increase in spiritual power because of this. Back then, he formed his golden core even before he had reached the age of sixteen, and his cultivation speed was so rapid that it was astonishing.</p>
<p>Afterwards, many people wanted to learn the secrets of the spiritual spring of the underworld from him, but Su Yishui never mentioned it. After retreating into seclusion, outsiders could not even see him, let alone ask.</p>
<p>For demonic cultivators who absorb others’ spiritual power to enhance their cultivation, they are willing to use everything to exchange for the key to the door of the spiritual spring of the underworld.</p>
<p>And Wei Jiu, who always took the shortcuts of the demonic way, naturally made every effort to seek this secret realm that could allow him to ascend in a day.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, with the execution of Mu Qingge, the whereabouts of the key became a mystery, and no one has ever visited the spiritual spring again.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu had seen the pattern of the key to the underworld in ancient bamboo texts, so as soon as he saw what was in Su Yishui’s hand, he immediately stopped.</p>

<p>Back when Mu Qingge was about to be annihilated, only Su Yishui was by her side. It would make sense if he obtained this secret key from her.</p>
<p>Hearing Wei Jiu’s question, Su Yishui tranquilly said, “Exactly. Without this item, it would be impossible for mortals to find the gate to the Netherworld in their lifetime.”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu’s eyes were fixed on the plaque and he slowly smiled, his eyes gleaming with an evil light, “Su, are you proposing a deal with me by taking out this item?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui held the key in his hand and said, “I came here today to make a Soul Oath with Master Wei. As long as Master Wei agrees, I will give this item to you.”</p>
<p>This statement stunned not only Wei Jiu, but also the people from other sects.</p>
<p>Even the always composed Master Kaiyuan of the Jiuhua Sect exclaimed in frustration, “Su Yishui, have you gone mad?”</p>
<p>If Wei Jiu really found the Netherworld spring and formed his Nascent Soul, no one would be able to match him. Wouldn’t that mean the demonic path would then dominate the world of cultivation?</p>
<p>When the three realms descend into chaos, how will the righteous path be able to fight back?</p>
<p>Wei Jiu was also wary and asked, “What kind of Soul Oath do you want me to make?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui said solemnly, “You can’t have both the fish and the bear’s paw. If Master Wei wants to explore the Netherworld, you must not seek to harm the spirit child born from the reincarnation tree. You must swear to withdraw your people from Jue Mountain immediately and never harm the life of the reincarnation tree’s spirit child, nor use it to cultivate or benefit yourself. If you break this Oath, you will incur heavenly tribulation and will never be reborn.”</p>
<p>Cultivators do not make Soul Oaths lightly, because once made, the pact becomes binding and true.</p>
<p>Su Yishui was clearly forcing him to give up the soon-to-be-born Mu Qingge in exchange for the key to the Netherworld.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu wouldn’t have cared about exchanging with anything else, but the Netherworld’s spiritual spring was too tempting.</p>
<p>Although Mu Qingge’s spiritual power was extremely yin, it couldn’t be compared to that ancient secret place. Moreover, he knew that the reincarnation tree bore two fruits. The first one, although weaker, had already taken some of the spiritual power. The whereabouts of that fruit were unknown, and he might not meet the conditions for ascending even if he took all the spiritual power from the later-born fruit.</p>
<p>If what Su Yishui said was true, of course, it would be best to get the key.</p>
<p>As for Mu Qingge, Wei Jiu knew that his feelings for her were more complicated. For cultivators, time is long, and waiting was definitely not going to be an issue.</p>
<p>He need only swear not to kill her today and not to harm her life in future, but what other plans he had in mind would not restricted by the Soul Oath! But… was the key authentic?</p>
<p>While Wei Jiu was doubting the authenticity of the key, Su Yishui calmly said, “I can also make a Soul Oath to guarantee that this key is real. However if you insist on fighting, I will immediately grind this key into dust.”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu couldn’t help but be agitated. The Netherworld’s spiritual spring was said to be a gate of nothingness and without this key, it was impossible to enter.</p>
<p>So he smirked and pondered for a moment before raising his eyebrows and saying, “If what you say is true, then I too, will keep my word.”</p>
<p>Just as the deal seemed about to be struck, those from the three major sects started to protest.</p>
<p>Master Wen Shitai of the Kongshan Sect, known for her fiery temper, shouted angrily, “Su Yishui, you were once a model of righteousness. How can you now engage in such treacherous impossible dealings with Wei Jiu? Stop talking nonsense and kill him quickly!”</p>
<p>Not only those orthodox sects, even Yu Chen and Yu Tong couldn’t understand. They felt that their Master lacked the vigor he once had when he wielded his sword. Not only did he seem to make preparations for nothing, but now he was even bargaining with evil forces. It was really hard to justify his actions.</p>
<p>However, Xue Ranran felt that her Shifu was tempering force with mercy, and his approach of using non-violent methods was truly brilliant!</p>
<p>She saw clearly that this demonic Wei was terrifying. His hooks were like hooks for butchering meat, tearing people’s bodies apart. If her Shifu were to confront him directly, wouldn’t he be at a disadvantage?</p>

<p>Seeing the old lady from the Kongshan Sect provoking and challenging her Shifu to sacrifice himself, Xue Ranran couldn’t help but raise her voice and said, “Even when the three major sects joined forces, they could not defeat Wei Jiu. Why don’t you appreciate my Shifu’s efforts to save you? If you could kill him, you should not retreat! It’s nearly lunchtime, and the situation hasn’t been resolved. If there’s a ceasefire, everyone can happily descend the mountain for a meal! Don’t take my Shifu like a sandbag on a dam, for you to place wherever you want to plug the leaks!”</p>
<p>Her Shifu must not act impulsively and rush forward. Otherwise, the disciples from the Xishan Sect like her would end up like rootless weeds, left to wither on Xishan.</p>
<p>Although Ranran thought she spoke loudly, her voice had always been delicate and soft . Her words carried a sweet and childish tone, softening the originally sarcastic words and making them sound more tender and aggrieved. Elder Wen, whose face turned red after choking with embarrassment and her head throbbed with anger.</p>
<p>Actually what Xue Ranran said was the truth that everyone was aware of. The three major sects had all gone to seek Su Yishui’s help, hoping he would take the lead in the fight against Wei Jiu and cut him down to size.</p>
<p>Their plan had been for Su Yishui to first weaken the demonic forces. Halfway through the fight, the three sects would then join forces to drive them back, thus adding another glorious tale of subduing demons to their legendary achievements .</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after his appearance was sealed, Su Yishui had became reclusive. His personality underwent a big change and he outright refused to help.</p>
<p>Later on, when he brought his disciples to Juefeng Village, everyone was relieved, thinking that although he had become eccentric, he had not abandoned righteousness and was not going to be just a bystander in this fight.</p>
<p>Who would have thought that at the critical moment in a fight to the death when the spiritual fruit was about to fall, Su Yishui would arrive late and even engage in negotiations instead of fighting?</p>
<p>Now, their intentions of using him as a patsy had been exposed by a young girl, making it hard for them to remain dignified.</p>
<p>While the Leaders of the Feiyun and Jiuhua Sects were also displeased, they had to watch as the situation on the mountain top intensified. If Wei Jiu didn’t leave and Su Yishui didn’t take action, they would have to watch Wei Jiu slaughter all the disciples of the three sects and abduct Mu Qingge.</p>
<p>As for the rumors of the Netherworld, no one knew the actual details, but back then Mu Qingge had still been killed by all of them after she explored that secret place, hadn’t she?</p>
<p>It’s clear that the most important thing at the moment is to drive away the demon Wei Jiu without risking a life-and-death battle, then make long-term plans after. Besides, in each of the major sects, there are great powers who are about to form their Nascent Soul, and they can’t afford any mistakes before ascending right now.</p>
<p>Master Kaiyuan spoke to ease the tension, “The item is in Su Yishui’s hands. If he is willing to give it away, he will bear the consequences. Master Wen, you need not be too angry.”</p>
<p>Master Wen snorted coldly, and after glaring at the soft-spoken young girl, she could only watch helplessly as Wei Jiu and Su Yishui made their Soul oaths with their blood.</p>
<p>After the oaths were made, Su Yishui threw the plaque to Wei Jiu.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu didn’t waste any time. After giving the masked Su Yishui a meaningful look, he gave a wave of his hand and his followers swiftly descended the mountain, laughing strangely as they left.</p>
<p>At this moment, Jue Mountain was left with only the righteous cultivators, the stench of blood, and the scattered corpses.</p>
<p>After Wei Jiu left, Master Kaiyuan, noticing the grim expressions of the other sect leaders, said, “Yishui, you were once a disciple of our Jiuhua Sect. Although you were abducted by the demoness and strayed from the path, you are inherently good. Why did you choose to allow bad consequences to occur in future?”</p>
<p>He had just comforted Master Wen, and now he was the first to criticize Su Yishui for making a deal with the tiger. He was clearly trying to get the others to start in on him.</p>
<p>Faced with his former Master, Su Yishui remained as calm as he has always been and simply said, “If I can’t defeat him, why should I court death?”</p>
<p>This statement, left everyone dumbfounded again.</p>
<p>It did make sense. Su Yishui had sacrificed his Golden Core to the tree and later fought fiercely against the Elders of the three major sects to protect it. He seemed to have suffered severe internal injuries at the time.</p>
<p>Since then, he had rarely appeared in public, but often sent Yuchen and Yutong to spend a fortune on searching for millennial ginseng and other medicinal herbs for pills to replenish Qi, which are obvious signs of a depleted spirit.</p>
<p>But even if he couldn’t defeat Wei Jiu, few would openly admit it in front of so many people!</p>
<p>Such an admission of weakness made his followers, including Gao Cang, cover their faces in low cries of lamentation.</p>
<p>Putting such truth out in the open, if the major sects continued to blame Su Yishui for not fighting or risking his life, they would have no grounds to do so.</p>
<p>After all, the leaders of these sects had all wisely retreated, so how could they blame others for not seeking death?</p>
<p>In any case, the path up the mountain was finally clear.</p>
<p>Several sect leaders now coveted the reincarnated spirit child, so Master Wen gave Su Yishui a glare before leading her disciples, including Wen Hongshan, to the top of the mountain first.</p>
<p>The other sects’ disciples, couldn’t be bothered with Su Yishui now, also rose into the air and headed towards the mountain top, once again resulting in a flurry of shoes falling from the air.</p>
<p>After they have all gone, the always silent Yutong asked with trembling lips, “Master, all these years, you never told us… Has your internal injury not healed yet?”</p>
<p>Yuchen and Yutong hadn’t spent much time with Su Yishui over the past twenty years, as he often secluded himself in a cave on West Mountain.</p>
<p>Although Yutong followed his instructions to regularly purchase medicinal herbs from various places, she didn’t know what he used them for, only that his medical earnings was quickly spent, so they always had to be frugal.</p>
<p>But today, before so many people, he candidly admitted he couldn’t defeat Wei Jiu… He had always been a proud person, how could he so readily admit this unless his body had reached its limit?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Yu Tong felt a wave of sadness. Hearing his sister’s words, Yuchen also realized the situation. Just now he had even thought that his Master was timid and weak. Overcome with remorse, he knelt down and choked out, “Master, we have failed to take care of you!”</p>
<p>With such a big scene, the four disciples also fell to their knees, their hearts filled with mixed emotions.</p>
<p>Bai Baishan felt regret for not doing enough research before becoming his disciple. Today’s events opened his eyes to the reality that there were always stronger men out there. He had always thought highly of XiShan’s renowned reputation, but now he realized that his Shifu was nothing in front of the other great cultivators…</p>
<p>Ranran felt genuinely sorry for her Shifu. She had heard many glorious stories about him in recent days. A natural talent, successful at a young age, it would indeed be lamentable if he became disheartened due to his injuries.</p>
<p>Looking at all his disciples kneeling, Su Yishui simply said, “Let’s go up the mountain.”</p>
<p>When they finally reached the top, they saw a large fruit had fallen under the Rebirth Tree.</p>
<p>The disciples of the various sects who had arrived earlier dared not approach it, warily watching the fruit.</p>
<p>Just as Su Yishui stepped onto the mountain top, the fruit suddenly burst open with golden light and slowly cracked open its shell.</p>

<p>Everyone was momentarily blinded by the light, and in that moment, a white cloak was suddenly removed from a female disciple of the Kongshan Sect.</p>
<p>When they regained their senses, they found that the cloak had already wrapped around the body of the girl, newly emerged from the shell.</p>
<p>Naturally, no man-made fabric would be on the body of a being born from a fruit. But in that instant of emergence, the girl managed to manipulate her spiritual energy to remove the cloak from the female disciple and wrapped it around herself.</p>
<p>This ability immediately made everyone wary, while also exciting them: True to her extremely Yin constitution, even after her soul had scattered and reincarnated, her spiritual energy remained undiminished. If one could make use of her, the benefits would be endless!</p>

<p><br/>Ran Ran stood behind her Shifu, squinting her eyes due to the dazzling light. As the light dissipated, she focused her gaze and thought, “What a stunning girl!”</p>
<p>The spirit child, now fully ripened and fallen from the tree, took the form of a sixteen or seventeen-year-old girl. Her features were as delicately outlined as if painted with a fine brush, and even without makeup, she was incomparably beautiful.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier couldn’t help but sigh, “There really is such a gorgeous lady in the world…”</p>
<p>Ran Ran nodded in agreement, but she also noticed that this spirit fruit girl bore a fifty percent resemblance to the portrait of their Grandmaster hanging in the main hall of Xi Shan. She thought it was about fifty percent because, although this girl was beautiful, she lacked the unrestrained and carefree demeanor depicted in the painting.</p>
<p>However, since her Shifu had criticized her taste as being too rustic, she felt she wasn’t in a position to judge such a beautiful girl too harshly.</p>
<p>And moreover, portraits don’t usually depict people accurately, so it seems that the person before her is indeed the reincarnation of her Grandmaster, Mu Qingge!</p>
<p>As for the young girl, after wrapping herself in the cloak, she looked around and, upon seeing the people around her, greeting slowly and said, “Long time no see, everyone.”</p>
<p>Seeing this, Teacher Wen spoke coldly, “You were shattered to pieces, yet you still carry memories from your previous life in this reincarnation. You’re truly extraordinary.”</p>
<p>The newly born girl gave a bitter smile and said, “Back then, I went astray and practiced the forbidden soul-transferring technique of the demonic path, which led me to commit many mistakes. It’s only right for the esteemed teachers to have taught me a lesson. I’ve been repenting for my sins while residing in this tree for twenty years, and I’m grateful to Yi Shui for giving me the opportunity to be reborn. This time, I will definitely correct my past wrongs and make amends for my mistakes.”</p>
<p>Her words seemed reasonable. At least the arrogant Mu Qingge of the past would never have spoken such humble words. It seems like being trapped under the Five-Finger Mountain like Sun Wukong for years has finally led to some repentance and education!</p>
<p>However, if one were to think about it, before practicing the soul-transferring technique, Mu Qingge of Xi Shan sect, despite being unrestrained, carefree and committed some minor transgressions, was not an evil doer.</p>
<p>Moreover, she once helped the then young prince, now the esteemed Emperor Su Yu of the Great Qi, ascend to the throne.</p>
<p>When Mu Qingge suddenly assisted Su Yu, who is also the uncle of Su Yi Shui, in winning the Great Battle of Fan Yao, she completely overthrew the then-powerful Prince Ping, laying the foundation for the current emperor to ascend to the throne.</p>
<p>Therefore, while the cultivation world shudders at the mention of Mu Qingge, in the secular world, her golden statue is still worshiped as the “War Goddess,” receiving offerings from the people.</p>
<p>Since Mu Qingge was always indulgent in worldly pleasures, whenever she was short of gold and silver, she would flatter the powerful and willingly get involved in worldly disputes, which is quite consistent with her character.</p>
<p>Such actions of clinging to the rich and powerful are also taboo in the cultivation world and are despised!</p>
<p>The once-ascended great cultivator, Yao Laoxian, once lamented that if Mu Qingge had been less infatuated with the secular world and more focused on her cultivation, she could have formed her Nascent Soul and ascended to immortality long ago.</p>
<p>And the drastic change in Mu Qingge’s personality, leading her down the path of destruction, indeed started after her return from the Netherworld Spring and her practice of the soul-transferring technique.</p>
<p>However, the people who had been guarding here for days and nights didn’t come to watch the drama of Mu Qingge’s repentance and reform.</p>
<p>Teacher Wen’s adopted daughter and chief disciple, Wen Hongshan, asked coldly, “You say you have repented, but you need to give everyone a convincing reason. Otherwise, you won’t be leaving Jue Mountain today.”</p>
<p>When Mu Qingge looked towards Wen Hongshan’s face, she showed a remorseful expression and said softly, “I am willing to sacrifice my spiritual power to heal the scar on Miss Wen’s face. I really shouldn’t have let jealousy get the better of me and scarred your face…”</p>
<p>Hearing her words, Wen Hongshan’s face suddenly changed and she stared at Mu Qingge without saying anything.</p>
<p>Among these people, Kai Yuan Zhenren was one of the kinder ones. He smiled slightly and said, “If Miss Mu is sincere in her repentance, that would be wonderful. We, the righteous cultivators, are indeed focused on saving others. However, to reassure everyone and to continue cultivating with peace of mind, it’s best for you to choose someone as your new Master and rejoin a sect. This would also be convenient for the righteous path to monitor and test your character, to see your sincerity!”</p>
<p>His words are exactly the intentions of the other sects.</p>
<p>Hearing Kai Yuan Zhenren’s suggestion, the others echoed in agreement.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge nodded and said slowly, “Since it’s Kai Yuan Zhenren’s proposal, I shall comply…”</p>
<p>She looked all around and finally set her gaze on the tall man wearing a black mask.</p>

<p>Although he was partially masked, his figure and aura were extraordinary. If he had once held a place in her heart, it’s likely that even reincarnation couldn’t make her forget.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge seemed to be filled with mixed emotions as she looked at Su Yi Shui and said softly, “Yi’er, it’s my fault. I had sealed your appearance. Now that I’ve decided to let go of the past and grievances, shall I release the seal for you?”</p>
<p>As she spoke, she raised her hand gently in a gesture to lift the curse. When she completed the gesture, there was no change in Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>Just as Mu Qingge showed a hint of unease, his black mask suddenly cracked and fell apart in two pieces.</p>
<p>The face revealed was as if drawn with ink, with eyes as deep as the starry sky, and a high nose that gave his cheeks a clear outline. Looking at him, one truly understood what it meant to have unforgettable love at first sight……</p>

<p>Although many people present had seen Su Yi Shui before, twenty years had passed, and unless one’s cultivation had reached an extraordinary level, everyone had aged somewhat.</p>
<p>For example, Wen Hongshan, who was around the same age as Su Yi Shui, now had fine lines around her eyes.</p>
<p>But the man in front of them, wearing a somewhat old long robe, had an unmistakably youthful face.</p>
<p>This couldn’t help but make people envious, and some even thought that the curse might have the effect of preserving youth and beauty!</p>
<p>Ran Ran stood quietly behind, feeling like she was watching a bizarre drama.</p>
<p>Others might not know, but she was well aware that her Shifu, Su Yi Shui, had long since recovered his appearance. However, he didn’t reveal it and instead cooperated with the reincarnated Mu Qingge to perform a touching drama of past grievances resolved.</p>
<p>What undisclosed mystery lies within?</p>
<p>Ran Ran kept her mouth shut, choosing not to spoil the moment of reunion between her Shifu and his former master.</p>
<p>However, as an observer, she couldn’t help but notice that Mu Qingge seemed to breathe a sigh of relief and relax a lot after seeing Su Yi Shui regain his appearance, regaining some confidence.</p>
<p>It seems that even a once-glorious demoness, after reincarnation, still has some insecurities, fearing that she might have lost her spiritual roots and no longer possess the spiritual power from her past life.</p>
<p>The other great cultivators present were delighted to see this. The centennial heavenly tribulation was approaching and several sect leaders about to undergo their Nascent Soul tribulations.</p>
<p>Therefore, whether Mu Qingge was truly repentant didn’t matter. What mattered was whether this demoness, with her cultivation physique, could sincerely protect them and shield them from the fatal blow of the heavenly tribulation during their tribulation.</p>
<p>Now that Mu Qingge had lifted the curse she had placed on Su Yi Shui before her death, it indicated that her spiritual power had recovered well during her twenty years on the tree. She was a talent worth utilizing, and so one after another, they scambled to get custody of this demoness.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge listened to their oblivious discussions, as if she was merely a dog or cat, without any resentment. She spoke softly, “I have been reborn and all past grievances are settled. If you still doubt me and fear that I might stray into the demonic path again, I’m willing to voluntarily become a disciple of Su Yishui. You can trust his character and abilities and everyone can rest assured.”</p>
<p>It seemed that Mu Qingge was very grateful to Su Yishui for sparing her life in the past and guiding her remnant soul to the reincarnation tree. In this lifetime, she would become his disciple and serve under him.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, the expressions of the crowd changed suddenly. After waiting so long for this ginseng fruit and suffering the losses of so many disciples, was it all to benefit Su Yishui?</p>
<p>At this moment, Su Yishui spoke slowly, “Xishan is just a small sect and I have recently taken in several new disciples. I simply cannot spare the energy to teach others. Moreover, you were once my Master. Re-entering my sect would disrupt the cardinal rules and fundamentals.”</p>
<p>With these words, the crowd relaxed. This young man Su had been lurking in the West Mountain for many years, but now he seemed more insightful than before, at least knowing not to meddle in this messy business.</p>
<p>However, Mu Qingge seemed surprised that Su Yishui would flatly refuse her request, her expression changing slightly.</p>
<p>She couldn’t help but look at the reincarnation tree—its spiritual power had been completely absorbed by the fruit in its final days, turning from half-dead to completely withered, showing no signs of the number of fruit it has borne…</p>
<p>When she gathered her thoughts again, she turned to look at the new disciples Su Yishui had mentioned—there were just four of them, none of them emanating spiritual energy.</p>
<p>Two male disciples were somewhat presentable, but the two female disciples lacked solid spiritual roots, especially the slightly chubby girl with purple lips, indicating some heart ailment.</p>
<p>As for the other girl, she was slender, a little fragile-looking, but with rosy cheeks and tender lips, exuding a cute innocence…</p>
<p>Before she could speak again, Su Yishui turned to his disciples behind him and asked, “Are you hungry?”</p>
<p>Ranran nodded vigorously; she had been hungry for a long while, anticipating a reunion banquet after the reunion.</p>
<p>Su Yishui turned back to the leaders and politely said, “My disciples are still at the foundational stage and young. They cannot endure hunger. So, I bid you farewell for now and take my leave.”</p>
<p>With that, he led his bunch of bewildered disciples away, gracefully departing down the mountain.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge’s eyes widened slowly, and in a desolate tone, she called out, “Yi’er!”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the rebellious disciple is still rebellious, so Yi’er acted as if he hadn’t heard, continuing down the mountain without looking back.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge clenched her fists tightly, took a long while to take in a deep breath to calm her emotions. She then smiled at the leaders, “Since Yongcheng Xishan refused to take me in again, Qingge can only trouble you to give me another chance to cultivate the immortal path by the righteous way…”</p>
<p>At this point, Mu Qingge glanced at the folding fan slowly opening in the hands of Kaiyuan Zhenren…</p>
<p>After a moment’s thought, she said, “Kaiyuan Zhenren is the most trusted person among you. I am willing to become a disciple under Kaiyuan Zhenren’s guidance, reform myself, and return to the righteous path.”</p>
<p>These words made the leaders of the other two sects somewhat displeased.</p>
<p>Among the three major sects, the JiuHua Sect had numerous disciples and a formidable presence. If Mu Qingge joined the JiuHua Sect, it would further diminish the standing of the other two sects.</p>
<p>Although the ultimate goal of the righteous path was to transcend the mundane world, they still had to make a living in the secular world for the next hundred years before ascension. Seeing the increasing strength of the JiuHua Sect, the leaders of the other two sects were resentful and once again engaged in a theoretical dispute.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge understood that Kaiyuan Zhenren had ways to deal with the leaders of the other two sects, whether through persuasion or coercion.</p>
<p>So, she didn’t need to worry about how Kaiyuan Zhenren would convince them. She shifted her gaze to the mountainside, where she could see Su Yishui calmly leading his attendants and disciples down the mountain.</p>
<p>He… didn’t even turn his head.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge bit her lip hard—where had things gone wrong? Why was everything different from what she had expected?</p>

<p>After she was standing silently for a while, the three major sects finally reached a decision: Mu Qingge would be supervised by the Jiuhua Sect on a daily basis. If she dared to act rashly, the Jiuhua Sect would immediately execute her. Otherwise, the other two sects would take over.</p>
<p>If the other two sects’ powerful figures encountered heavenly tribulations, the Jiuhua Sect would send disciples to assist them with all their might.</p>
<p>With this arrangement, everyone was satisfied.</p>
<p>It was only after the people from the other two sects had finally dispersed that Mu Qingge turned and smiled at Kai Yuan Zhenren. She glanced at the folding fan in his hand – it was painted with a picture of a white tiger lying under the shade of some banana leaves.</p>
<p>This fan was painted by Mu Qingge herself and had been taken away by the current Emperor, who was the little prince Su Yu at the time.</p>
<p>The realm of cultivation and the secular world are like water in separate wells, not interfering with each other.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge’s involvement in the struggle for the throne was already improper. And since Su Yu was the Emperor, even if he was grateful for Mu Qingge’s assistance, it would not be appropriate for him to intervene directly and provoke the future powerful immortals.</p>
<p>But how could he, as the Emperor, stand by and watch his benefactor from the past be reduced to a prisoner?</p>
<p>It was obvious that Kai Yuan Zhenren received this fan as a trust from the Emperor, signaling to Mu Qingge that he would take care of her on behalf of the Emperor.</p>
<p>That’s why, after she glanced at the fan, she immediately understood and chose the Jiuhua Sect to “supervise” her.</p>
<p>Sure enough, after everyone left, Kai Yuan Zhenren, with a smile on his face, took out a letter from the Emperor and handed it to her.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge took the letter and read it slowly. The gist of the letter was that Kai Yuan Zhenren was a trusted expert by the Emperor, and he would definitely take good care of “War Goddess” Mu Qingge.</p>
<p>Kai Yuan Zhenren has always been tactful in his actions, and it seems that he has had many contacts with the court of Qi in secret. No wonder, among the three major sects, the Jiuhua Sect’s reputation is the most magnificent, and its disciples are spread all over the world, with unparalleled strength.</p>
<p><br/>Mu Qingge’s heart was reassured after reading the sincere words in the letter.</p>
<p>See, everything is going smoother than she imagined – Mu Qingge indeed had a notorious reputation. But as long as she is willing and put in effort, not wasting her innate talent, she can stand at the pinnacle of power and look down on all beings!</p>
<p>With this thought, she wrapped her cloak tighter around her and slowly exhaled in the wind: It’s really good to be able to live again. She will definitely plan every step carefully and live…… even more brilliantly than Mu Qingge did!</p>
<p>Taking a break from how the powerful figures on the summit of Jue Mountain has distributed the ginseng fruit for now.</p>
<p>Speaking of the early departure from the Xi Shan Sect, the first thing the master and disciples did after descending the mountain was to go into a town to eat at a restaurant.</p>
<p>Previously, because of Su Yishui’s sealed appearance, to avoid scaring people, the Yu siblings rarely went to lively places in towns when they occasionally went down the mountain with him.</p>
<p>Firstly, it didn’t fit the habit of cultivators who usually isolate themselves from the crowd. Secondly, they were afraid that Su Yishui would be ridiculed by those commoners.</p>
<p>But today, Master’s curse is finally lifted, and there’s no need to cover up with a veil or a mask anymore.</p>
<p>Yu Tong was happy for her Master, and coupled with the clamoring of the younger disciples, she decided to splurge on a lavish restaurant for a “Forever Young Banquet.”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran had already been hungry when they were on the mountaintop. When dish after dish of beautifully plated dishes were served, her big eyes shone brightly, and her chopsticks moved without stopping, practically inhaling the dishes, soup and rice.</p>
<p>However, Qiu Xier ate without tasting the food at all. She just stared blankly at her stunningly handsome Shifu, and finally clutching her chest, swallowed an emergency pill to save her trembling heart.</p>

<p>Goodness, Shifu is so youthful and handsome! How is one supposed to keep their heart calm and focus on cultivation?</p>
<p>While she was staring helplessly, Su Yishui suddenly looked up, casting a glance her way.</p>
<p>Just that indifferent glance sent a shiver down the spine of the infatuated Qiu Xier. Her heart beat even more intensely, but it was not palpitations but due to fright.</p>
<p>She dared not raise her head to look at Shifu impolitely anymore and just imitated her junior sister Ranran, burying her head in food.</p>
<p>After she was about a third full, Ranran resumed the demure airs that a young girl should possess. She stopped focusing on her own eating and drinking, and diligently served dishes and soup for Shifu and her Uncle Masters.</p>
<p>However, Shifu seemed to have not moved his chopsticks at all. His fasting periods seemed to come and go unpredictably. After they had left XiShan, he had only eaten some food cooked by Ranran when he was in Juefeng Village.</p>
<p>The rest of the time, Su Yishui would occasionally drink some water, but never seemed to eat anything bought along the way.</p>
<p>Ranran wondered if this was a side effect of eating the “Gluttonous Pill” she concocted, as Shifu seemed to only be willing to eat what she cooked.</p>
<p>Feeling overwhelmed with honor, Ranran also felt a great responsibility resting on her shoulders. At the very least for the next meal, even if they were on the road, she would have to find a way to prepare some warm and palatable food for Shifu.</p>
<p>After the meal, Ranran obediently took the medicine bag handed over by Shifu and drank most of the bag of tree root water under his gaze, before starting their return journey to Xi Shan in Yongcheng.</p>
<p>However, not far after exiting the town, Yu Tong whispered to Su Yishui, “Master, someone is following us…”</p>
<p>Su Yishui did not respond, continuing to lead his disciples leisurely on the country path. Obviously, he had long noticed someone tailing them but had remained silent.</p>
<p>Ranran who experienced the carnage on Jue Mountain, naturally did not think that the person secretly following them would be an admirer of Shifu.</p>
<p>She whispered to Su Yishui, “Why don’t we turn back?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui actually replied this time. He lowered his head at his little disciple and asked, “Why?”</p>

<p>Ranran whispered, “When we were on Jue Mountain, that demon Wei Jiu agreed too readily. Human nature is greedy, and powerful people do not deign to make choices. If possible, they would take both the fish and bear’s paw… Didn’t you say in our lessons before that although Soul oaths are reliable, they have a fatal flaw, which is that if the party who made the Soul oath is no longer alive, the Soul oath automatically dissolves…”</p>
<p>Listening to the young girl’s soft and detailed analysis, Yu Tong and Yu Chen also suddenly realized: That demon Wei Jiu was determined to get Mu Qingge, so how could he give up so easily? It was just that at that time, he was wary of Su Yishui and the other powerful cultivators joining forces, so he pretended to agree, first securing the key to the Netherworld.</p>
<p>Then, after Su Yishui and the three major sects went their own way, he could move to eliminate Su Yishui, completely lifting the Soul oath that shackled Wei Jiu.</p>
<p>Just like what Ranran said, if they now return to the town, they might be able to join up with other immortal sects that have not left yet, and the demon Wei Jiu might become hesitant to act.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Yu Tong urged anxiously, “Master, let’s hurry back. If someone blocks the way, you just go on ahead. My brother and I will cover the rear for you!”</p>
<p>But Su Yishui just looked at Ranran thoughtfully and continued to walk forward.</p>
<p>Not far from them was the Scholar tree forest they had passed by before.</p>
<p>Ranran remembered that Shifu had them rest here. He also frequently went for walks alone in the forest. Later, he even took her inside to bury some seeds whose names she did not know…</p>
<p>Just then, a few disciples dressed in black from the Crimson Gate suddenly appeared, attacking Su Yishui with Flame Throwing Umbrellas.</p>
<p>The Crimson Gate uses the fire element, and their umbrellas were equipped with mechanisms. In addition to the Kunlun Mountain black oil that aided combustion, they also contained the wielder’s spiritual power. Thus, ordinary flames were enhanced into Samadhi Fire. Once burned, flesh and blood would instantly turn to charred bones.</p>
<p>Therefore, one has to maintain a distance from these flames!</p>
<p>As the disciples manipulated their fire umbrellas to close in on Su Yishui, he raised his hand to draw water from a nearby canal to resist with a water wall.</p>
<p>At first, the water wall looked quite decent, eight feet high and difficult to cross. But in less than the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, the “wall” gradually thinned and became shorter.</p>
<p>Anyone familiar with cultivation knew that this was due to insufficient inner core strength and a lack of flow in spiritual power! Su Yishui was indeed a paper tiger that could be easily overcome, completely vulnerable!</p>

<p>The assailants were overjoyed and they advanced boldly!</p>
<p>Just as Su Yishui’s robe sleeves were half scorched by the true fire, he frowned and instructed the Yu siblings and disciples behind him, “Enter the forest immediately, find a large tree wrapped in thick vines, and climb up. Without my command, no one is allowed to come down!”</p>
<p>As he spoke, he held Ranran with one arm, lightly tapped his toes and flew into the forest. He leaped onto a large tree almost covered in purple vines.</p>
<p>After setting Ranran down, he instructed her to hold onto a thick branch and sit down, then turned and leaped to an adjacent tree.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier was also carried up the tree by her second uncle master, Yu Tong, while the eldest uncle and the other two junior brothers also climbed up the trees, ready for battle.</p>
<p>Ranran was still in shock and looked intently at the forest. The setting sun’s afterglow hadn’t yet faded, and the rosy light spread throughout the forest, making everything clear.</p>
<p>The forest floor was covered with dense purple vines, many of which had climbed up the trees.</p>
<p>But just a few days ago, when she and her master entered the forest, there weren’t so many thick vines here!</p>
<p>The tree Ranran was on was very tall. From her high vantage point, she could see clearly that the large trees climbed by the purple vines were located at one corner of the forest, totaling eight trees.</p>
<p>The thick vines on the ground were not growing randomly; they seemed to be arranged like a diagram. When the vines connected with the eight large trees, it looked like… like the Fuxi Bagua diagram drawn at fortune-tellers’ stalls!</p>
<p>However, counting her Shifu and the disciples, there were seven of them, each occupying one tree, leaving one tree unoccupied, which seemed empty.</p>
<p>…No, that empty tree also had something, a fluffy white ball, wasn’t it the white cat her Shifu kept in the cave on Xi Shan? When did it follow them here?</p>
<p>At this moment, the white cat climbed to the highest point of the tree, meowing with its mouth open, looking majestic like a mountain king.</p>
<p>As Ranran was looking around, a foul wind suddenly rose, the disciples of the Crimson Gate had already surged in like a tidal wave, surrounding the entire forest tightly.</p>
<p>It seemed like they intend to shoot fish in a barrel and bleed them dry!</p>
<p>Wei Jiu’s voice now echoed from on high in the forest: “Brother Yishui, you’re really good at hiding! Hiding in the forest and not coming out, do you intend to be a weak coward?”</p>
<p>It seemed that Wei Jiu has already heard that Su Yishui had suffered severe internal injuries and damaged his cultivation. Now he will kill him and break their Soul oath!</p>
<p>Thinking of the reports from the spies he planted in the three major sects, which said that after he left, Su Yishui had admitted in front of everyone that he was severely damaged internally and dared not confront him, Wei Ju was livid.</p>
<p>In the past, he had been repeatedly defeated by Su Yishui and inevitably had some fear. He never even considered the idea that the current Su Yishui was just a paper tiger.</p>
<p>Considering that he was easily tricked by Su Yishui into making a soul oath and leaving Jue Mountain, he felt that if he didn’t tear Su Yishui to pieces, his hatred would not be appeased!</p>
<p>After receiving the report from the spy, Wei Jiu immediately turned back, planning to ambush the motley crew from Xi Shan on the way.</p>

<p>This opportunity is truly a rare occurrence, with favorable conditions and timing meeting! Wei Jiu naturally wanted to seize this chance to eliminate his inner demons accumulated over the years.</p>
<p>However, upon probing, Su Yishui indeed lost the imposing manner of being as unstoppable as before. Although he had sensed that the followers of the Crimson Gate were tailing them, he found it difficult to withstand even a few ordinary Crimson Gate disciples for long. In the end, he and his few disciples had to hide in the forest like cowards.</p>
<p>After Wei Jiu’s men tested Su Yishui’s baseline, he actually felt himself in a leisurely mood, wanting to toy and torment this young man who used to dominate him.</p>
<p>He decided to show up in person, planning to strangle each and everyone of his weak disciples in front of Su Yishui, break his limbs and then drain his remaining spiritual power!</p>
<p>But as Wei Jiu took a few steps into the forest, he suddenly saw the densely covered purple vines in the center of the forest. He narrowed his eyes to look closely. His expression changed drastically, and he muttered, “This is bad!”</p>
<p>He wanted to retreat from the forest immediately.</p>
<p>But at this moment, it was already too late! His men had already stepped on the purple vines…</p>
<p>The next moment, the originally silent vines suddenly moved like agile pythons, moving swiftly!</p>

<p>The entire forest instantly turned into an Eight Trigram maze, enclosed in an iron bucket, intercepting all intruders at different positions, making it difficult for them to reinforce each other.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu furrowed his brows and hollered, “Burn the vines with fire!”</p>
<p>His disciples immediately used their fire umbrellas to spray fire at the vines entwining towards them. However, the fire seemed to enhance the growth of these strange plants. In a short time, the originally arm-thick vines became as thick as tree trunks!</p>
<p>These plants have a fire attribute! Could it be… the legendary demonic Binding Immortal Vine? It thrives even more with fire…</p>
<p>Wei Jiu had a rude awakening and wanted his disciples to quickly stop the True fire attacks, but it was too late. He only heard the wretched screams of his disciples not far away, separated by the dense vine wall and the smell of burnt flesh filled the air.</p>
<p>Obviously, they didn’t manage to burn the vines but burned themselves to a crisp.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu quickly looked around and soon found eight large trees with people crouching on them, realizing that these eight trees were the eye of the formation. If he wanted to get out, he had to destroy the eye first.</p>
<p>So he leaped up and attacked the tree without anyone on it.</p>
<p>He was eager to break the formation, so naturally, he chose a good starting point. The large tree in the northwest corner where no one was present, was the best target.</p>
<p>But who would have thought that as soon as he approached that tree, a snow-white ball of fluff suddenly jumped out of the treetop. Looking closely, it turned out to be a cat.</p>

<p>It seems that Su Yishui’s arrangement of the vine formation had lacked manpower. This demon vine needs living people to drive it, so it seems he had caught a random cat to act as a substitute .</p>
<p>Wei Jiu sneered inwardly, dodging countless vine attacks with his agile body. He then wielded his twin hooks, intending to cut the big tree in half from the middle of the tree.</p>
<p>These vines were born attached to the eight large trees. As long as the trees were cut, the vines would naturally wither and die. But just as the hooks were about to hit the trunk, a thunderous roar sounded from above.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu looked up and all blood drained from his face— that cat suddenly opened its mouth wide and turned into a glaring white tiger in that thunderous roar, suddenly pouncing towards him.</p>
<p>He quickly used a Shifting technique to avoid the white tiger’s fatal blow.</p>
<p>After the white tiger missed its attack, it jumped back onto the tree with a resounding roar, shaking the ground of the entire forest.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu exclaimed incredulously, “Geng jin White Tiger! Mu Qingge’s mount… has been in your hands all along?”</p>
<p>Back then, Mu Qingge had shunned ordinary mounts like horses and bulls and felt that they were too mundane. She once went to the Western Sky Jade Peak alone and subdued a Geng jin White Tiger.</p>
<p>Although this tiger has the appearance of a tiger, it is actually an ancient exotic beast that feeds on living beings and is extremely ferocious. It once participated in the Fan Yao Battle with Mu Qingge and gained fame from that battle.</p>
<p>Considering the ferocity of this tiger, Wei Jiu, who was eager to break free, naturally didn’t want to entangle with it any further. He turned his head and looked at the big tree where a comely young girl was sitting.</p>

<p>However, when that young girl saw him glaring over at her, she didn’t panic at all; instead, there was a kind of eager smile on her face… which made one suspicious.</p>
<p>Moreover, that young girl’s smile… seemed somewhat familiar, but Wei Jiu couldn’t recall where he had seen her before.</p>
<p>He was naturally very paranoid and seeing Xue Ranran smiling so brightly, he felt something was amiss, so he decisively turned around and attacked the big tree where Su Yishui was.</p>
<p>When he turned around, he naturally couldn’t see the calm and composed expression of the young girl behind him instantly collapse, her hands clasping in prayer while chanting softly.</p>
<p>Thank heavens, she was just afraid that this demon would come over, so she deliberately smiled at him. Although her Shifu instructed her that as long as she stayed on the tree, the vines would protect her, this fierce belly-splitting demon coming aggressively over was still terrifying!</p>
<p>But Wei Jiu charged towards her Shifu, she did not know if Shifu was confident enough to withstand his thunderous strike.</p>
<p>Su Yishui had been meditating with closed eyes on the central tree to the north all along. His left finger pointing upwards and his right finger pointing downwards, his wrist constantly rotating as if controlling the vine attacks.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu put in eighty percent of his spiritual power into this thunderous strike, intending to kill Su Yishui instantly and eliminate future troubles.</p>
<p>After all, Su Yishui was not who he used to be. Where was his formidable prowess? Wei Jiu had cultivated hard for twenty years and was very confident. Even the heads of the three major sects might not be able to withstand this fatal blow.</p>
<p>But just as his hooks were about to reach him, Su Yishui suddenly opened his eyes wide and took out a long rolling pin.</p>
<p>Ranran, who was on the adjacent tree, naturally saw it clearly; it was the one her mother had given  her when she returned to Xi Shan.</p>
<p>No wonder she couldn’t find it when she was making biscuits before leaving the mountain. It turned out her Shifu had kept it in his sleeve.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu’s double hooks were extremely domineering. But Su Yishui, calm and unhurried, met them with the rolling pin. With a clever move, he parried the hooks with the rolling pin and quickly locked them up. As one who reels in a kite by rapidly taking in the string, he entangled them around the rolling pin.</p>
<p>This may look effortless, but it required channeling spiritual power continuously to counter the Qilin hooks; otherwise, a normal wooden stick would have been broken by the hooks immediately, how could it become the shortcoming of the hooks!</p>
<p>Wei Jiu exerted force to pull back his hooks, but he was unable to overpower Su Yishui. At this moment, he realized that Su Yishui was also entangled with purple vines, absorbing the spiritual power of the entire forest’s vines to fight him. Su Yishui’s open eyes also emitted a purple demonic light.</p>
<p>This trash Su, is so despicable! Su actually merged with the vines, manipulating the purple vines to absorb his spiritual power.</p>
<p>Even he, a demonic cultivator, scorned using methods aided by demonic boosts. It was a pity that Su Yishui, a model of righteousness, had fallen so low to the point of using demonic vines in combat!</p>
<p>These vines usually takes more than ten days to grow and requires extremely strict conditions of feng shui and light. How shrewd must Su be, designing this step by step, constantly showing weakness, leading him into this trap that he had prepared in advance.</p>

<p>Wei Jiu finally understood everything, but it was too late now.</p>
<p>As Su Yishui quickly reeled in, he had already pulled Wei Jiu to his side.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu was good at long-range attacks. He had fought with Su Yishui before and knew he shouldn’t get close to Su Yishui’s body. Within a foot, it was all Su Yishui’s domain, and it was difficult to free oneself when one got close.</p>
<p>As a last resort, Wei Jiu had to release the double hooks and try to retreat. But the rapidly growing vines around him had already coiled around him like a dragon. Even if Wei Jiu used spiritual power to shatter a few, new vines immediately entangled him again.</p>
<p>This kind of consumption was simply never-ending. Even Wei Jiu, who was about to form a Nascent Soul, couldn’t keep up. Because those purple vines seemed to have thin tendrils that pierced into his body like needles, constantly absorbing his spiritual power…</p>
<p>Feeling his spiritual power plummeting rapidly, Wei Jiu began to panic. He gritted his teeth, shouting, “Su Yishui! If anyone finds out that you’re secretly nurturing demonic vines, your reputation will be ruined!”</p>

<p>But Su Yishui, who seemed to be in a demonic state, did not stop at all, absorbing the unending stream of spiritual power through the vines.</p>
<p>Right then, Su Yishui used the vines to quickly absorb Wei Jiu’s spiritual power into his body. In a moment, his hair crown shattered, his long hair danced in the air, looking like an evil god descending.</p>
<p>But his face was still expressionless, until Wei Jiu was about to be covered by the vines all over his body, he coldly spoke, “Twenty years ago, I had told you to stay away from me, otherwise I would… kill you.”</p>
<p>When Su Yishui said this, his eyelids lowered, showing disdain, his tone as if crushing an insignificant cockroach.</p>
<p>This inherent contempt stimulated Wei Jiu’s hatred, making him grit his teeth.</p>
<p>But he knew clearly that this Su wasn’t bluffing!</p>
<p>These purple vines has got to be the legendary Parasitic Immortal Vines. If entangled by this demonic thing, it was very likely to end up a dry corpse.</p>
<p>Everyone else all thought Su Yishui was upright, lofty, and even disdainful of associating with his father, the Prince Ping who became a rebel king.</p>
<p>But Wei Jiu always felt that this guy was very sinister, making him fearful.</p>
<p>Now he had fallen into Su Yishui’s trap and was about to become a dried corpse. The only solution was to pull a *cunning escape by sacrificing half of his golden core and see if he could break free.<br/>*金蝉脱壳<em> literally means golden cicada escapes its shell</em></p>
<p>Thinking of this, Wei Jiu was infuriated. He could only grit his teeth and chant a spell, forcing out half of his golden core. Turning it into a human form with spiritual power, he let the purple vines entangle it. As for himself, he silently chanted the Earth Escape Technique, quickly shrinking and escaping underground.</p>
<p>Seeing how he was just about to form a Nascent Soul but was now forced to sacrifice half of his core, destroying years of cultivation in an instant, his frustration was beyond words.</p>
<p>But this method did work, at least saving his life.</p>
<p>When the battered and exhausted Wei Jiu finally crawled out of the ground, he looked back at the faint purple light in the forest. He reached out, and crushed the subordinates who came to talk to him, absorbing their spiritual power to replenish his depleted golden core.</p>
<p>“Su Yishui! I am your sworn enemy!”</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan stood aside, feeling shocked and terrified, with a wave of heartache upon looking at her Master in such a sorry state.</p>
<p>Not to mention Wei Jiu cursing and swearing, using foul language, vowing to tear Su Yishui into pieces.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the forest full of vines, after Wei Jiu fled in panic, the last rays of the setting sun also disappeared. As the forest gradually became shrouded in darkness, those purple vines wilted rapidly as if dehydrated, disappearing in a blink of an eye.</p>
<p>When Yu Chen and the others came down from the trees, still in shock, Gao Cang looked amazed and said, “Shifu you are truly amazing! It’s a pity that the people from the three major sects are not here, or else who would dare to say you are weak!”</p>
<p>But Bai Baishan had an unsettled expression. He had been obsessed with cultivation since he was young, naturally understanding more than Gao Cang and the others.</p>
<p>Just now, Wei Jiu shouted “demonic vines”. If what he said was true, wouldn’t Su Yishui be privately nurturing demonic things prohibited by those of the righteous path?</p>
<p>Upon hearing the hesitant inquiry from his second disciple, Su Yishui mildly said, “All living things grow, each with its own purpose. Whether it’s demonic or celestial, it’s all determined by the heart. If it can save a life, how could it be a monster?”</p>
<p>This statement was ambiguous, neither denying nor admitting. Bai Baishan was tactful and didn’t ask further.</p>
<p>However, it was clear that Su Yishui had taken the third path of cultivation. By using the purple vines to absorb more than half of Wei Jiu’s cultivation, and effectively filled his own golden core which had been empty for a long while. Such a high-grade supplement as Wei Jiu’s cultivation was something you couldn’t buy even with a thousand taels of gold!</p>

<p>Even though Xue Ranran is young, she had formed a habit since she was confined to the yard by her parents. She liked to look over their wall and quietly observe and think about the people walking outside.</p>
<p>However, it was obvious that her Shifu was not someone she could easily figure out. She felt that her Shifu was truly unfathomable and one would find him difficult to guard against.</p>
<p>Clearly, he had taken advantage of the opportunity presented by the birth of the spirit fruit to carefully weave a large net. Su Yishui was like a hunting spider, while Wei Jiu was a fat and juicy worm that came charging into the net.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder that back then, Mu Qingge ended up in such a tragic situation. If Su Yishui had intentions to scheme against someone, it would definitely be meticulously planned and undetectable.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Xue Ranran suddenly felt a suffocating feeling in her chest and she sighed faintly. However, as soon as she finished sighing, she saw her Shifu looking at her coldly.</p>
<p>“What are you thinking about?” </p>
<p>Ranran hesitated and said, “I just feel that Shifu is really very…..clever!”</p>
<p>After saying this, she felt that her tone was not sincere enough, so she was about to put on a smiling face and start flattering her Shifu profusely.</p>
<p>However, Shifu did not seem very pleased. He turned around, and left the woods quickly.</p>
<p>Ranran touched her hair bun, unsure if Shifu was angry. But she also thought that if the seeds she planted harmed passing travelers, it wouldn’t be good.</p>
<p>After Shifu had cooled down, he set her concerns to rest. “That plant has a very short life, once it withers, it will not sprout again. Moreover, its seeds are difficult to bear, taking three hundred years to produce one.”</p>
<p>Ranran breathed a sigh of relief after hearing this, but she couldn’t help but wonder, “Shifu, why did you ask me to plant it?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui brought the tree root water to her mouth and said lightly, “Your life’s lot favors plants. Aren’t the flowers in your yard blooming very well?”</p>
<p>Ranran obediently drank the water, feeling that her Shifu’s words made sense. Indeed, the flowers, plants and vegetables she had been growing since childhood all flourished.</p>
<p>However, after drinking the water, there was brown medicine residue left on the corner of her lips. Su Yishui took out a handkerchief to wipe it. Ranran felt embarrassed and moved back a bit.</p>
<p>Su Yishui said flatly, “Girls should be neat, this is disgraceful, don’t move!”</p>
<p>Ranran could only remain still, letting her Shifu wipe her mouth. But her big eyes had nowhere else to settle on, so she could only stare blankly at her Shifu’s handsome face.</p>
<p>Seeing his face up close, like a painting, was truly like a breath of fresh air. Su Yishui did not say anything, just letting his little disciple stare at him in a daze.</p>
<p>However, there seemed to be something brewing in his lowered eyes, but it was difficult to discern in this moment.</p>
<p>Shifu and disciple sat together on a large rock, appearing to have a harmonious relationship. However, Qiu Xier, watching from afar, always felt something was off about the relationship between her little junior sister and their Shifu.</p>
<p>Their Shifu was cold and would sometimes teach them by simply pointing to ancient texts, letting them figure it out themselves without saying anything more than necessary.</p>
<p>However, he would speak more to their little junior sister. Yet it wasn’t accurate to say that Shifu only favored her because sometimes, he was always particularly strict with her.</p>
<p>Take the fact that the little junior sister had not been allowed to touch the alchemy cauldron again! Unlike her, who had already begun a higher level of cultivation.</p>
<p>After successfully ambushing the demonic cultivator Wei Jiu, the journey ahead became much smoother.</p>
<p>Bai Baishan was worried that Wei Jiu would spread rumors about Shifu using demonic vines, so while fetching water by the river, he brought it up with his fellow disciples.</p>
<p>But Ranran laughed and said, “I think Wei Jiu would be the one more worried about this.”</p>
<p>Xier didn’t understand and asked, “What would he be worried about?”</p>
<p>“He should be worried that Shifu will spread the news that he lost alot of his cultivation!” Ranran filled the water bag while tilting her head.</p>
<p>After hearing the words of the little junior sister, Bai Baishan suddenly realized: Wei Jiu had always been unscrupulous and made many enemies. Now that he had been drained of his cultivation, he would definitely keep a low profile and never reveal his vulnerability voluntarily.</p>
<p>When they returned to Xishan, Xue Ranran finally had the chance to bathe and change clothes, lying comfortably in bed to sleep. But after lying down for a while, Qiu Xier, who was afraid of the cold, knocked on her door, wanting to sleep together.</p>
<p>Ranran had never had sisters to accompany her since childhood, so she was a bit unfamiliar with the late-night chats under the same blanket with her sister, which also felt novel.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier had been unsettled these past few days, unable to resist sharing the ups and downs she had experienced.</p>
<p>Although it had been less than half a month since they had left Xishan, Qiu Xier had gained a whole new understanding of her sect and Shifu.</p>
<p>Especially after seeing the reincarnated former Grandmaster Mu Qingge in Jue Mountain, she had already written a complete script filled with grievances and love.</p>
<p>It was mostly about their demonic Grandmaster Mu Qingge lusting after her handsome disciple, unwilling to let go even after reincarnation. However, Mu Qingge was so beautiful that it was difficult for any man to resist.</p>
<p>Is Shifu Su Yishui naturally cold-blooded or has he cultivated away desire. Back then, Shifu could still act ruthlessly even while facing such a beautiful woman, showing that one can be invincible if they are heartless.</p>
<p>Thinking back to the day when they were eating in town, that one look Shifu gave her made Qiu Xier shudder even in the warm blankets.</p>
<p>Ranran asked with some curiosity, so Qiu Xier described with effort, “It’s like… being stared at by a fierce beast… no, something even more terrifying than a fierce beast, as if at any moment, Shifu would grind me into ashes…”</p>
<p>As she spoke, Qiu Xier remembered Shifu’s iron-blooded tactics when confronting Wei Jiu in the woods, and she now belatedly started crying in fear.</p>
<p>Although Ranran couldn’t empathize, she still hugged her fleshier sister tightly, comforting her softly.</p>
<p>At the same time, Ranran thought about how there were a few times when she caught Shifu lost in thought, and his gaze towards her seemed profound and unreadable.</p>
<p>It was clear that Shifu was very sensitive about others coveting his beauty. So Ranran felt a wave of lingering fear and darkly reminded herself not to be disrespectful and stare at Shifu too much.</p>
<p>After returning to Xishan, Su Yishui had to go into seclusion at the mountaintop for a month again. It would probably take some effort to digest Wei Jiu’s spiritual power to rebuild his golden core.</p>
<p>During this time, representatives from the three major sects came knocking several times but they now found that the once easily penetrable West Mountain spiritual shield had suddenly become very strong, and they couldn’t break through no matter how they tried.</p>
<p>After the trip to Jue Mountain, Wei Fang from Jiuhua Sect especially looked down on Su Yishui.</p>
<p>But since they failed to break into West Mountain several times, they couldn’t help but wonder: That Su Yishui, who was clearly too weak and afraid to fight Wei Jiu head-on, why was his mountain protection spiritual shield becoming stronger?</p>
<p>Although the people below the mountain refused to leave and insisted on waiting for Su Yishui to end his seclusion, the top of West Mountain remained very peaceful.</p>
<p>After the white tiger came out of the forest, it had turned back into a cat-like appearance and seemed very hungry. It would disappear into the woods on most days, but every now and then, it would grab a few wild chickens and run into the kitchen, and meow non-stop at Ranran.</p>
<p>Only later did Ranran understand that the little tiger was asking her to remove the chicken feathers.</p>
<p>Although she was initially a little afraid of it, she realized that it too was a fellow gourmet and so she  formed a good impression from its good taste. She would pluck the feathers very cleanly and even thoughtfully cut the meat into pieces so that it could lie on the porch, basking in the sun while eating.</p>
<p>Ranran followed its example. She moved a rocking chair from the old storage room, brought a plate of homemade almond walnut pastries, and spent her time leisurely in the courtyard.</p>
<p>While her other three fellow disciples were busy with their studies and rigorous training, Ranran used cooking their three meals as an excuse, finding lots of time to slack off.</p>
<p>Most of the time, she could quickly prepare the meals and then sit in her small courtyard, watering flowers, plants and the small tree, eating pastries, and bask in the sun.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, that small tree Shifu had instructed her to take care of had grown a lot after they returned. Its lush branches had spread out, looking like a small green umbrella from afar. Every time Ranran hid under the shade of the tree, she could take a sweet afternoon nap.</p>
<p>Before going into seclusion, Shifu had instructed them to get books from the study and study on their own.</p>
<p>However, Second Uncle Master Yu Tong prohibited them from entering without permission; she would always be the one to bring out the books for them. But on this day, Yutong had something to do, so she instructed Ranran to fetch the books from the study.</p>
<p>Among these disciples, Ranran was the most deft and careful, so she probably would not damage Master’s belongings.</p>
<p>This was Ranran’s first time entering Shifu’s study. It was said that this had also been the study of their former GrandMaster, and it contained countless ancient texts, mostly on bamboo slips and sheepskin.</p>
<p>Ranran brought a large ladder and climbed up to the high bookshelves. After sorting the books according to the list given by Second Uncle Master, she suddenly noticed the tiger pattern carved  onto the shelf.</p>
<p>This was probably the work of the former GrandMaster, depicting the scene of a Geng jin tiger playing with a hedgehog. The tiger’s tail was high in the air like a hand, and quite amusing.</p>
<p>For some reason, Ranran felt an urge to pull the tiger’s tail. But as soon as she pulled it a couple of times, she heard a “click” from the highest shelf.</p>

<p>Ranran thought she had damaged the shelf and panicked, quickly climbing up to check. However, she found that behind a few books, there was a secret compartment full of dust, obviously untouched for a long time.</p>
<p>Driven by curiosity, she reached in and pulled out a package wrapped in oiled paper. Opening it, she found a book made of some unknown material, with two big characters “Playing Classics” written elaborately on the cover.</p>
<p>She recognized this writing style, its similar to the palace rules on the hall walls, indicating that this was compiled by Mu Qingge herself.</p>
<p>Ranran nodded in admiration. The former GrandMaster was indeed unique, being able to compile a guide like the “Playing Classics” just from “playing” alone!</p>
<p>With a sincere mind to learn, Ranran flipped open the first page and saw all sorts of “play” listed in the index. There was Food and Culinary arts, Brewing methods of famous alcohols, Appreciation of exotic items, and Explorations of famous mountains.</p>
<p>The Food section recorded the former GrandMaster’s experiences of enjoying delicacies.</p>
<p>For example, the pan-fried buns from the Capital’s ShengJi, paired with condiments of a half spoonful of mature vinegar from Baiwei Zhai with three drops of spicy oil. The tofu from Bagong Mountain must be blanched with cilantro to fully appreciate its freshness… and so on, there were many detailed instructions on culinary pairings.</p>
<p>Grandmaster Mu was afraid that her gourmet experiences would be lost, so she earnestly compiled them into a book, intending to pass them down to her disciples and grand-disciples!</p>
<p>Ranran read through the pages with relish until she came across a section called “Fierce Beasts.” She wondered if it recorded the method for taming the Geng jin white tiger. So she turned to that page according to the index.</p>

<p>But when she looked at that page, Ranran was dumbfounded again. The lifelike illustration of a beautiful young man… wasn’t it her Shifu, Su Yishui?</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-19251" data-attachment-id="19251" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-caption="" data-image-description="" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="LDT Ep10 CLEAN (05004)" data-large-file="https://loveofthedivinetree.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ldt-ep10-clean-05004.jpg?w=1000" data-medium-file="https://loveofthedivinetree.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ldt-ep10-clean-05004.jpg?w=300" data-orig-file="https://loveofthedivinetree.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ldt-ep10-clean-05004.jpg" data-orig-size="1920,1080" data-permalink="https://loveofthedivinetree.wordpress.com/2024/04/27/love-of-the-divine-tree-chapter-19/ldt-ep10-clean-05004/" height="1080" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" src="https://loveofthedivinetree.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ldt-ep10-clean-05004.jpg" srcset="https://loveofthedivinetree.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ldt-ep10-clean-05004.jpg 1920w, https://loveofthedivinetree.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ldt-ep10-clean-05004.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://loveofthedivinetree.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ldt-ep10-clean-05004.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169 300w, https://loveofthedivinetree.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ldt-ep10-clean-05004.jpg?w=768&amp;h=432 768w, https://loveofthedivinetree.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ldt-ep10-clean-05004.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=576 1024w" width="1920"/></figure>
<p>And beside the illustration were serious annotations: “This creature is ferocious, dislikes onions and garlic, will retaliate if provoked, must be approached with caution. If praised for its appearance, its killing intent will peak. Must be coaxed slowly, and if given dried longans marinated with sea salt, can pacify anger by a third…”</p>
<p>As Ranran read this, she couldn’t help but burst out laughing.</p>
<p>What a sarcastic former GrandMaster!</p>
<p>Shifu Su Yishui was just a sixteen-year-old teen back then. Mu Qingge played with his youthful nature like this, knowing that he avoided others discussing his appearance but she went against the grain and even compiled it into a book…</p>
<p>No wonder Shifu hated her so much that he eventually betrayed her and left her sect!</p>

<p>Come to think of it, Shifu also has his favorite snacks. How delicious can this sea salt-cured longan be..</p>
<p>Ran Ran was quite a connoisseur, but she still couldn’t imagine what it tasted like.</p>
<p>This book was obviously the former Grandmaster’s personal item, hidden here and never discovered by anyone.</p>
<p>Ran Ran felt that if she took it out and kept it on herself, and Shifu found out, she would probably be grinded to dust.</p>
<p>So she read it for a while and reluctantly put it back, planning to return to read this great work thoroughly another time.</p>
<p>As the chapter on food in “Playing Classics” was right up Ran Ran’s alley, she memorized a few recipes to try out.</p>
<p>Notably there was a kind of wine called ” Detain Heaven’s Immortal,” which was said to be so delicious that it made people reluctant to ascend to immortality.</p>
<p>Ranran was curious, so she found rice grains for brewing, bought wine jars, and tried to brew some. Although the process of making this wine was complicated and required precise control of temperature and humidity, Ranran managed to grasp the technique after a few failed attempts.</p>
<p>Her parents ran a snack stall in town, so Ranran thought if she could brew some wine and let her mother sell it, they could earn more money and her parents wouldn’t have to work so hard.</p>
<p>Of course, she also made some sea salt-cured longan, but after a few tries, it just did not taste good. She tried adding some honey to offset the sharp taste from the salt, which finally worked.</p>
<p>One day, after the little tiger had eaten two chickens, it jumped into Xue Ranran’s arms contentedly. A girl and a tiger, lying on the rocking chair, quickly falling asleep.</p>
<p>When Su Yishui finally came out of seclusion and arrived at his disciple’s courtyard, what he saw was the swaying branches and a young girl hugging a cat, sleeping deliciously.</p>
<p>Su Yishui with his long legs, walked without a sound and stood beside the chair. The little tiger glanced at him with alertness, before running off with a swish of its tail.</p>
<p>In her drowsy state, Ranran felt her face itching a little. When she opened her eyes slightly, she realized her respected Shifu had arrived.</p>
<p>She quickly got up, still half-asleep, and said, “Shifu, did you need me for something?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui was still in his plain clothes, reached out to pick some fallen leaves on her head and asked, “At this hour, shouldn’t you be meditating in the grass hall?”</p>
<p>Hearing Shifu ask this, Ranran suddenly realized she had been caught slacking off. She stammered, “We’re having braised duck in brown sauce and mushroom buns tonight, so I came back early to prepare the ingredients…”</p>
<p>Su Yishui said mildly, “Do you think just because you’re getting healthier, you don’t need to study anymore?”</p>
<p>Ranran quickly made up an excuse, “Disciple dares not, it’s just… disciple truly doesn’t have the constitution for immortal cultivation, so I thought I’d first memorize the Pill Alchemy classics and then practice other things, to avoid mistakes in future pill-making alchemy…”</p>
<p>As she spoke, she felt ashamed about slacking off and making up lies, so she decided to honestly admit her lack of progress, to save her Shifu’s efforts.</p>
<p>So she gritted her teeth and said honestly, “My mother said as long as I cultivate a healthy body well, I don’t need to truly cultivate immortality… in the future, I would still leave the mountain to serve my parents.”</p>
<p>Su Yishui asked calmly, “So, is that your aspiration, just to live for a few decades, then marry and have children, repeating your parents’ lives?”</p>
<p>Ranran felt that isn’t this the wish of most people? Although it sounded plain and mundane, it wasn’t too bad.</p>
<p>But hearing a hint of reproach in her Shifu’s words, she decided to embellish her aspirations a bit more: “Of course, I also want to earn more money for my parents, so they can build a bigger house.”</p>
<p>Su Yishui continued to look at her directly and said, “Then in the future, you should marry someone wealthy. If you marry a prince or a king’s son, your wish will be fulfilled at once.”</p>
<p>Ranran felt she wouldn’t be so blessed, but hearing Shifu say that, she couldn’t help but smile in embarrassment.</p>
<p>Su Yishui seemed uninterested in the girl’s blushing smiles, and said with a stern face, “Since you’ve entered my sect, how can you lack ambition? If you continue to be lazy like this, you can pack up and leave immediately.”</p>
<p>Ranran quickly apologized in a small voice.</p>
<p>Unlike the other disciples, if she were expelled from the sect and her strange illness recurred, she would have no other way to live.</p>
<p>Su Yishui nodded and asked Ranran to make him a cup of tea.</p>
<p>As Ranran was making tea inside, she suddenly glanced at the honey jar, where she had put the sea salt-cured longan according to “Playing Classics.” So she grabbed a handful and plated it, along with the tea, and sent them out on a tray.</p>
<p>Shift clearly came to find fault today, so she had to appease the old gent.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, when Shifu saw the plate with the dried longan sprinkled with fine salt, he didn’t say anything for a long time. He then asked icily “Where is this from?”</p>
<p>Ranran did not dare to mention the impudent “Playing Classics”, so she said quietly “I ate it before so I tried to make some. Shifu would you like to try some?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui downed his tea in one gulp, but he won’t even touch that dried longan. He then turned around and left without a word.</p>
<p>Ranran felt a bit despondent as she ate the longan, tasting the salty-sweet flavor spreading on her tongue… this thing wasn’t actually very tasty.</p>
<p>Although Mu GrandMaster had already been reborn, she certainly did not know that her former ferocious beast disciple had changed his taste. This dried fruit which used to reduce anger by thirty percent, was no longer effective.</p>
<p>The next morning, while Ranran was cooking, she heard from her cooking assistant, her second uncle Master talk about the constant stream of visitors coming to the mountain in the past few days.</p>
<p>It turned out that the ginseng fruit Mu Qingge had finally decided to join the JiuHua Sect.</p>
<p>The JiuHua Sect was the most prestigious and powerful among the three major sects. The other two sects had nothing to say about Mu Qingge’s decision.</p>
<p>As the new Master of Mu Qingge, Master Kaiyuan had a dignified demeanor. His first act was to send Wei Fang to escort Mu Qingge to the West Mountain and personally demand the artifacts and mount that belonged to her.</p>
<p>But since Su Yishui had been in seclusion all this time, the letter demanding these items couldn’t be delivered. Wei Fang and his team couldn’t enter the mountain, so they could only leave their calling card at the stone in front of the West Mountain gate.</p>
<p>When Su Yishui came out of seclusion, Yutong handed the calling notice to the Master.</p>
<p>The Yu siblings were very disdainful of JiuHua Sect’s eager stance to let Mu Qingge claim her inheritance from the entire West Mountain.</p>
<p>Setting aside the grievances between Su Yishui and Mu Qingge, Mu Qingge had once said in front of the Xishan disciples that Lingxi Palace would be inherited by Su Yishui in the future.</p>
<p>These past twenty years, it had been the three of them managing and taking care of this place.</p>
<p>Now, although Mu Qingge had been reborn, she was no longer the Master of Lingxi Palace after she had passed. Now she was asking for her things again, which inevitably seemed like she was going back on her word.</p>
<p>Su Yishui didn’t comment on this. He had Xue Ranran and others send down the little tiger, some small and large divine artifacts and a sparkling sword adorned with gemstones.</p>
<p>Ranran had been feeding the little white tiger often these days. As she fed it, she developed some affection for it. Thinking that she wouldn’t get to see it again in the future, she felt unwilling to part with it.</p>
<p>So on the way down the mountain, she held the little tiger, whispered to its fluffy ears and told it not to catch mice to eat anymore, not to be too picky with food if there’s no one to pluck chicken feathers; after eating, to remember to wipe its paws with a damp cloth.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier watched nervously from the side, fearing that her junior sister would babble too much and anger the fierce Geng jin Divine Beast, lest it bit her junior sister’s head off with one bite.</p>
<p>But if one was not aware, that white tiger Divine Beast really did look just like a cat. It lay obediently in Xue Ranran’s arms, occasionally sticking out its tongue to lick her face.</p>
<p>When they reached the foot of the mountain, Ranran found out that Mu Qingge was here as well. It seemed that she was treated very well in the JiuHua Sect, surrounded by a group of disciples, not looking like a prisoner under house arrest but more like a pampered guest.</p>
<p>Bai Baishan said softly beside her, “It is said that our former GrandMaster was good at ingratiating herself with the rich and powerful. Back then, she helped the current emperor ascend to the throne, making significant contributions. So even though she violated the taboos of immortal cultivation, privately opening up the demon realm and almost causing a disaster, she is still an eminent figure in the imperial palace!”</p>
<p>As he spoke, there was an unmistakable envy in the words of the second senior brother. After all, not everyone could ascend to immortality, but gaining favor and prestige among the powerful was immediately gratifying.</p>
<p>One would suppose that since Mu Qingge was so comfortable in the JiuHua Sect, there must be someone backing her up behind the scenes.</p>
<p>In this light, Mu Qingge’s reincarnation wasn’t a complete failure; she could definitely start anew and rise again!</p>
<p>There were even several people around her who looked familiar.</p>
<p>Ranran recognized them; they seemed to be the ones who had come to West Mountain seeking medical treatment but had been rebuffed. They seemed to be… servants of Minister Lin, and the tall, thin, fair-faced scholar they followed, could he be Minister Lin’s son who came seeking medical treatment before?</p>
<p>Seeing that tall and thin young master Lin behaving respectfully, calling Mu Qingge “Master” repeatedly, it seemed that Mu Qingge had quickly acquired a noble disciple by her side, adapting swiftly to everything twenty years later…</p>

<p>However, when Mu Qingge saw that it was Su Yishui’s disciples who brought the items, and not Su Yishui himself, a hint of disappointment appeared on her face.</p>
<p>Since Ranran and the others knew that this was their former Grandmaster— the previous owner of West Mountain, so even though they weren’t on good terms with Wei Fang and the other JiuHua disciples, they just handed over the items civilly as requested.</p>
<p>Everything else was fine, but when it came to the Geng jin White Tiger, just as Mu Qingge reached out her hand, the tiger suddenly bristled its fur and growled menacingly at Mu Qingge with a ‘Ao~u’.</p>
<p>Its body obviously like a cat, but its mouth suddenly enlarged, its tiger roar thundered, catching everyone off guard.</p>
<p>The disciples of the JiuHua Sect couldn’t help but step back, and Mu Qingge seemed to resist retreating as well. With a forced smile at the Geng jin white tiger, she said with a hint of regret, “Back then, I made a soul oath with this tiger before it became my mount. Now it seems that when my spiritual energy was disrupted twenty years ago, this oath was broken. It’s originally a wild divine beast of the mountains and should be free. Since it doesn’t want to be with me anymore, I won’t force it…”</p>
<p>After hearing this, the little tiger ignored everyone. It flicked its tail, and turned to the mountains to catch chickens to eat.</p>
<p>While others were fine with this, Ranran was very happy to hear this; it seemed that she could still bask in the sun together with the little tiger in the yard in the future.</p>
<p>Although Mu Qingge didn’t want her former mount anymore, she accepted everything else without hesitation. Especially when she looked at the sparkling sword, she seemed to attach great importance to it. It was said that this sword was specially made for Mu qingge by the current emperor in the past and was very precious.</p>
<p>“How come there’s no Nine Revolutions Black Iron Pill Cauldron?” she asked softly.</p>

<p>The few junior disciples who came down the mountain had never heard Shifu mention any cauldron before.</p>
<p>So, when Bai Boshan heard Mu Xian Shi’s question, he quickly volunteered and ran up the mountain to ask their Shifu if he had left any cauldron behind.</p>
<p>Su Yishui rarely had such leisurely moments. He was adjusting the strings of his zither by the pavilion in the courtyard. When Bai Baishan came to ask, Su Yishui responded with a question of his own, “Did your little junior sister personally give those things away?”</p>
<p>Bai Baishan respectfully replied, “You instructed her to do so, she naturally delivered everything perfectly. However, there was no pill furnace among the things she took!”</p>
<p>Su Yishui used his long fingers to pluck the freshly tuned zither strings, producing ancient and clear melodies. Then, he lowered his gaze and said, “Tell the visitors from below that the furnace was refined from meteoric iron that I personally extracted from the Snow Peak and refined. It was only loaned to Mu Qingge and does not belong to her. If I don’t want to give it, no one can take it away.”</p>
<p>After remembering Shifu’s instructions, Bai Baishan hurried back down.</p>
<p>While Bai Baishan went to inquire, Mu Qingge had been chatting with the remaining three disciples. Despite just falling from the tree not too long ago, Mu Qingge was a great conversationalist, worldly-wise, fitting her experiences from two lifetimes.</p>
<p>In just a few words, she had managed to inquire about the background and origins of Su Yishui’s new disciples.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t say much. Whenever Mu Qingge asked about her, Ranran only pretended to be enchanted by Mu Qingge and kept smiling foolishly.</p>
<p>It’s not that Ranran had any secrets about her family background. She was just cautious because she felt that Mu Qingge had too many entanglements and conflicts with their Shifu. Currently unclear if she was friend or foe, Ranran wondered what she should do if Mu Qingge remained unchanged in her ways, used her family as leverage to coerce her into harming her Shifu.</p>
<p>So when Gao Cang saw that she wasn’t speaking and was eager to answer for her, Ranran quickly interrupted him, pointing to the persimmon tree beside the mountain road and smiling, “Teacher Mu, are you thirsty? Would you like me to pick a few persimmons for you to eat?”</p>
<p>Mu Qingge smiled and shook her head, but she did take a few more glances at this girl named Xue Ranran.</p>
<p>Among Su Yishui’s disciples, only this girl seemed to have some brains and looked quite decent…</p>
<p>As her thoughts wandered, she suddenly reached out and grasped Ranran’s slender wrist, concentrating to feel her pulse and spiritual power.</p>
<p>However, after a grip, she found there was nothing, no echo, no trace of spiritual wood aura… This girl was just average in talent, an ordinary person with nothing exceptional.</p>
<p>Su Yishui used these few mediocre disciples as an excuse to reject her outright, unwilling to continue the Master-disciple relationship with her…</p>
<p>She remembered hearing Su Yishui’s heart-wrenching “Qingge” before her soul had scattered. Why did he look so indifferent now that they met again?</p>
<p>Could it be that he knew about the spirit fruit that had fallen earlier?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Mu Qingge took a deep breath. She had discreetly asked Grandmaster Kaiyuan of Jiuhua Sect before, and he didn’t know about how many spirit fruits had been on the tree.</p>
<p>Let alone Su Yishui, who had always been reclusive!</p>
<p>The unripe fruit which had fallen prematurely sixteen years ago, indicating that “she” had no will to survive. Now that was no sign at all and was probably gone by now.</p>
<p>And she just needed to focus on managing everything well for herself.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Mu Qingge felt a little relieved. But when she heard the message from Bai Baishan, something seemed to be swirling in her eyes. A shimmer of tears evoked sympathy from others.</p>
<p>Beside her, Wei Fang glared, “Your Xishan Sect is too arrogant. You should know that this furnace is for the current Emperor’s alchemy purposes…”</p>
<p>Before he could finish his words, Mu Qingge shot him a sharp look, and Wei Fang immediately realized his mistake and shut up grudgingly.</p>
<p>Since she had been rejected, Mu Qingge didn’t mention the furnace again and instead changed the subject to talk about how she missed the old houses of West Mountain and wanting to take a walk up the mountain.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Mu Qingge’s requests to revisit Lingxi Palace and see the ice lotus she had planted in the back mountain were also turned down by their master.</p>
<p>Poor Bai Baishan had to climb up and down to relay messages, his back aching terribly. He also had to carefully consider how to convey Shifu’s words without hurting Mu Xian Shi’s feelings.</p>
<p>But since she had retrieved the sword bestowed by the Emperor, Mu Qingge didn’t say anything further. She just kindly instructed the younger disciples of West Mountain to take care of the lotus pond in the Xishan Lingxi Palace before leaving with the disciples of Jiuhua.</p>
<p>It’s well-known that Mu Qingge especially loved lotus flowers. It was said that she was so obsessed, that in order to collect a rare ice lotus, she had ventured into the lakes in the Snowy Mountains and fought dragons for them!</p>
<p>So her parting instructions were reasonable, showing her reluctance to part with her beloved possessions from the past.</p>
<p>However, after she returned, Second Uncle Master sighed slightly when Ranran and her were chatting as they prepared their meal.</p>
<p>Few people knew that Mu Qingge had built the lotus pond back then solely for Su Yishui. At that time, his internal fire was too strong, and he could not control the early formation of his Golden core, which almost caused him to rupture and die.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Mu Qingge found a pool of ice lotus from Yaochi and she personally blessed it. She soaked herself and Su Yishui in the lotus pond for forty-nine days, slowly guiding back his heart that was going out of control.</p>
<p>At this point, the Second Uncle Master had to admit that although Mu Qingge’s actions were bizarre and absurd, she was exceptionally good to her disciples.</p>
<p>Its unfortunate that she didn’t follow the right path and eventually caused a disaster, leading to her downfall.</p>
<p>Ranran, after listening to the Second Uncle Master, suddenly realized something.</p>
<p>She had been puzzled before why Mu Qingge had mentioned the lotus pond so specifically before leaving.</p>
<p>Now, thinking about it, she was indeed nostalgic for the flowers and plants of West Mountain, but she probably also hoped to evoke Su Yishui’s memories, remind him of her kindness, and salvage their past master-disciple relationship?</p>
<p>After finishing her meal, Ranran took a walk in the mountains and specifically went to the back mountain to look at the lotus pond.</p>
<p>Now that it was almost winter, the lotus flowers had long withered, and all that remained was desolation. There was nothing particularly unforgettable about this lotus pond.</p>
<p>After looking for a while, she rolled up her pants, took a shovel and tried to dig for some lotus root by the pond.</p>
<p>Since that day she had expressed her ordinary mortal aspirations, just wanting to go down the mountain early to serve her parents, and perhaps marry and have children for a peaceful life, she noticed that her Shifu seemed somewhat displeased when he looked at her.</p>
<p>Ranran thought it might be because her Shifu had been in seclusion for too long and hadn’t eaten anything to his liking. So today, she planned to make some refreshing Fried lotus root.</p>
<p>Regrettably, the ground by the pond was too slippery. Ranran almost slipped into the pond several times, which frightened her, as she can’t swim. She quickly retreated, ending up with only muddy feet for her trouble.</p>
<p>Because her feet were now dirty, Ranran washed them with a bucket of water. She then decided to take a bath too. As a cultivator of Pills, the most convenient thing was a constant supply of warm water throughout the day.</p>
<p>When she wanted to take a hot bath, she could use any of the large stoves in the alchemy room. But after bathing, Ranran looked at the pill furnace that the Second Uncle Master had returned to her a few days ago. Its surface was blackened and dirty, somewhat displeasing to the eye.</p>
<p>Since she had taken a bath herself, she thought she might as well clean the cauldron too. Perhaps her sincerity would move the cauldron, and it wouldn’t embarrass her during the next alchemy session.</p>
<p>Holding onto this thought, Ranran found a rag and some alkaline water to remove the dirt and grime from the furnace. She hummed a tune as she wiped the furnace.</p>
<p>After wiping it a few times, Ranran found that this Pill furnace’s surface was actually quite good, with beautiful patterns engraved on it, so she wiped it even more vigorously.</p>
<p>After cleaning most of the furnace, she discovered that it was originally made of a material that resembled gold but wasn’t gold. It seemed like the bottom of the furnace got burned later on, and a black metal was used for repairs.</p>
<p>It was evident that the repairs were done very carefully, as even the patterns were seamlessly restored. Ranran accidentally saw a line of engraved characters on the bottom of the furnace.</p>

<p>She carefully looked at it and softly read aloud, “Nine Revolution Black Iron.”</p>
<p>After reading it, Ranran fell silent for a moment, then her eyes gradually widened: could this “Nine Revolution Black Iron” be… the one Mu Qingge had wanted to take?</p>

<p>Since the disciples from Jiuhua Sect had come from afar specifically for this item, it indicated that it was precious and rare enough. But, did Shifu just casually give this furnace to her, a mediocre novice?</p>
<p>Ranran felt uneasy. She quickly washed her hands, picked up the wild persimmons she had picked from the foot of the mountain and ran to find her Shifu.</p>
<p>When she entered her Shifu’s courtyard, she didn’t find him. She searched all the way and then circled back to the dried-up lotus pond.</p>
<p>Before she could see anyone, she heard a melodious tune of a Guqin.</p>
<p>The simple melody played with this ancient tone had a kind of lingering excitement. Ranran couldn’t help but slow down her steps, quietly listening to the melodious tune.</p>
<p>At this moment, the man with long hair draped over his shoulders was sitting on a wooden bridge, closing his eyes and plucking the strings facing the withered lotus pond.</p>
<p>At first, it was like a nocturne softly murmuring in half-revealed moonlight. Gradually, the Guqin became intense, like the solemnity of a battlefield, ringing with sharpness. In a trance, Ranran seemed to be in a noisy battlefield, countless arrows were shooting towards her.</p>
<p>But the next moment, someone pulled her onto the White Tiger. Someone beside her angrily roared, “You save others, why not save yourself first?”</p>
<p>In her daze, the stirring zither sound calmed again. It was only then that she came to her senses, touched her somewhat itchy face, and realized that tears were streaming down her face.</p>
<p>The zither sound now ceased and the fragrance of lotus filled the air. In the time Su Yishui played the zither with his eyes closed, the already dried-up lotus pond miraculously bloomed with lotus flowers again…</p>
<p>The Yaochi Ice Lotus were not ordinary. Each one was snow-white and translucent, as if carved from ice and snow, crystal clear and bright…</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t even have time to wipe away her tears. She was full of joy and amazement as she came to the edge of the lotus pond, looking at the blooming flowers and saying, “Shifu, you really have miraculous powers, these flowers…”</p>
<p>At this point, she paused slightly.</p>
<p>Only just now, Mu Qingge mentioned that she hoped someone would take care of her lotus pond. And afterwards, Shifu used music to channel his spiritual power, growing a pond full of rare and beautiful ice lotuses.</p>
<p>This former Master and disciple seemed to be of the same mind!</p>
<p>People always said that Su Yishui and Mu Qingge’s relationship was ambiguous, and now it seemed to be true!</p>
<p>Shifu seemed tough and cold but clearly, his zither music contained deep worldly affections, showing great longing.</p>
<p>Ranran, who had heard many variations of stories of Master-disciple relationships from third senior sister, was very bright. In an instant, she inferred that Su Yishui was only firm in speech but soft in heart towards Mu Qingge.</p>
<p>If he still cherished their past relationship, why did he refuse to let her come up the mountain earlier? If he could let Mu Qingge see her beloved lotus flowers, surely then they could let go of their unresolved grudges!</p>

<p>Su Yishui had walked up to her without her noticing. He took out a handkerchief and handed it to her.</p>
<p>Ranran, feeling embarrassed, quickly took it and wiped her tears. She smiled serenely, “Shifu’s zither skill is truly exquisite. I was enchanted and moved by it, and somehow, I ended up crying.”</p>
<p>Su Yishui looked at her little tear-stained face, his expression slightly tense. He lowered his head and asked, “When you heard the music, did you remember anything?”</p>
<p>Ranran opened her mouth halfway, intending to mention the scenes in her imagination from earlier, but the words that came out were, “I was just moved by the music.. And it’s great that the lotus flowers are blooming again. We can pick the lotus leaves to make Beggar’s Chicken…”</p>
<p>As she finished speaking, she noticed that her Shifu’s face had turned cold as ice.</p>
<p>Remembering not to stare at Shifu like an infatuated girl for too long, Ranran quickly lowered her head. She suddenly remembered the reason for coming to find Shifu and asked, “Shifu, the Pill furnace you gave me to use… is it the Nine Revolution Black Iron Furnace?”</p>
<p>She then mentioned her discovery after cleaning the furnace earlier and ended with a timid question, “Could it be that Shifu, unintentionally, mistook it for an old furnace and gave it to me?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui’s face still looked upset, seemingly processing that Beggar’s Chicken. But his tone was gentle, “It was idle just being there, so don’t you let it go to waste.”</p>
<p>Ranran, seeing her Shifu’s tacit acknowledgment, suddenly felt a surge of enthusiasm like red flames in her heart: she, such a mediocre novice, had been given the best furnace by her Shifu! If she couldn’t refine thousands of Resurrection Divine Pills, wouldn’t it be a waste of her Shifu’s deep affection?</p>
<p>The previously indifferent and unambitious heart, at this very moment, now had an impulse to reform and begin anew!</p>
<p>Ranran solemnly promised her Shifu that she would be completely focused and work hard to refine decent pills this time.</p>
<p>Su Yishui didn’t even look at her this time, just stood silently by the pond, watching the sparkling ice lotuses, lost in thought. Watching his back, there was a hint of loneliness…</p>
<p>Ranran did not dare to disturb Shifu’s contemplation. After bowing respectfully, she left with light steps.</p>
<p>Third Senior Sister was already starting to refine a higher-grade Marrow-cleansing pill, so Ranran had to practice diligently day and night; she couldn’t be lazy anymore.</p>
<p>This time, facing the bright and clean furnace, Ranran quietly recalled Shifu’s teachings on calming the mind and spirit, crossed her legs, and focused her energy in her lower abdomen.</p>
<p>At first, she could still hear the crackling of the furnace fire, but gradually, as her breath and pulse harmonized, the surrounding noises gradually faded away.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier, who had just dozed off, blinked groggily and inadvertently glanced at Ranran beside her. She couldn’t help but be stunned.</p>
<p>Whether it was the reflection of the furnace fire or not, there was a faint glow on her little junior sister’s face, and her entire person… seemed a bit different from usual.</p>
<p>As to what was different, Qiu Xier couldn’t quite pinpoint it, but she felt a sense of awe and respect!</p>
<p>Qiu Xier sighed, realizing that meditation could indeed elevate one’s disposition. So, she didn’t dare to slack off and quickly closed her eyes, focusing on the furnace fire to calm her mind and spirit, hoping to become a peerless beauty like her Shifu soon.</p>
<p>Perhaps sensing Ranran’s sincerity, this time when the furnace was opened, it was not overflowing with the scent of steamed buns. Ranran quickly took the Clear-Heart Pill and went to find First Senior Brother.</p>
<p>She hadn’t done well last time, so this time she had to make it up to her senior brother and help him calm his mind.</p>
<p>However, Senior Brother Gao cang waved his hand like fanning a fan, hastily saying that he’s been very calm recently and doesn’t need to take any pills.</p>
<p>When she handed it to Second Senior Brother, he forced a smile, saying that he’s had diarrhea recently and shouldn’t eat randomly.</p>
<p>Ranran knew that her Pill Alchemy reputation had been tarnished. Last time she nearly killed Senior Brother, so naturally no one dared to take it this time.</p>
<p>She didn’t want to trouble others, so she tried it herself. As she tasted it, she found that this time it actually carried the sweet and refreshing  taste of lotus flowers.</p>
<p>Ranran was a quite nervous herself and instructed Qiu Xier to take away all the snacks in her room so that she wouldn’t lose control at night and eat until she died without anyone knowing.</p>
<p>However, this time, the Clear Heart Pill was obviously refined very well. A day passed, and Ranran just didn’t feel like eating anything.</p>
<p>Even when cooking for everyone and smelling the aroma of bamboo shoot chicken, she remained indifferent.</p>
<p>This made Ranran, who found enjoyment in eating, feel quite sorrowful.</p>
<p>The chicken had been brought by a patient healed by Shifu and was a local short-legged Luhua chicken from the village below. Its legs were thick and its buttocks plump, looking very delicious. Ranran was originally looking forward to eating this chicken and even asked Second Senior Uncle to buy bamboo shoots to go with it.</p>
<p>During the meal, everyone enjoyed the food immensely. Even Su Yishui drank three bowls of chicken soup in one go. Only Ranran looked at everyone dully, having no urge at all to eat any of the dishes.</p>
<p>Seeing Ranran’s pitiful appearance, Gao cang felt sorry for her and said, “Although the Clear-Heart Pill can calm the mind, it shouldn’t be so overbearing as to make someone abstain from food immediately?”</p>
<p>Bai Baishan continued, “In my opinion, little junior sister, although your foundation is a bit lacking, you are truly a genius in alchemy. Every time you refine pills, you can produce extraordinary ones. But junior sister, don’t test pills recklessly next time. If something goes wrong, it’ll really make people have heartache.”</p>
<p>Su Yishui didn’t say much, just ate almost half of the chicken, which seemed to really suit his taste.</p>
<p>But seeing his second disciple once again trying to please his junior sister, he spoke up, “Heartache indicates a lack of vitality and blood circulation. You need to practice your cultivation more. Tomorrow, when working on your legs…”</p>
<p>Bai Baishan was quite clever and suddenly realized that Shifu probably didn’t like seeing his disciples flirting. Before Shifu finished assigning “homework,” he immediately took over Shifu’s bowl, deftly adding more soup for him and said with a smile, “Shifu, I just said that junior sister’s cultivation is not yet mature. If she eats something wrong, it will teach her a lesson… Junior sister, you must be more attentive, don’t let Shifu worry about you.”</p>
<p>This kind of ambiguous attitude made even Qiu Xier scornful so she glared fiercely at Second Senior Brother.</p>
<p>She initially found Second Senior Brother refined and polite, pleasing to the eye. But after spending time together, she felt that boys like Senior Brother, who were straightforward and reliable, were more trustworthy.</p>
<p>After the meal, Su Yishui called Ranran, who was about to clean up the dishes, and asked her to follow him to the back mountain and then to the edge of the lotus pond.</p>
<p>He pointed to the most flourishing lotus bloom in the middle of the pond and said to Ranran, “Go, pick that one.”</p>
<p>Ranran said, “Oh,” and then looked around for a small boat to enter the water. The middle of the lotus pond was very deep. Without a boat, it was impossible to reach.</p>
<p>But Su Yishui said, “No need for a boat, just walk straight over.”</p>
<p>Ranran looked at the lotus pond in disbelief and asked in a low voice, “What am I supposed to walk on?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui, with his hands behind his back, said tranquilly, “Step on the lotus leaves that is used to wrap Beggar’s Chicken, and you’ll be able to cross.”</p>
<p>Hmm… Ranran was a bit unsure whether Shifu was mocking her or genuinely wanted her to do so.</p>
<p>Although the species of lotus flowers in the pond were valuable, the lotus leaves were nothing special. If she stepped on them, she would definitely fall into the water.</p>
<p>Ranran had been weak since childhood. Her mother didn’t allow her to play in the river with the other children in the village, so she didn’t know how to swim. Upon hearing Shifu’s words, she was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Su Yishui saw her staring at him as if he were a murderer, and his lips curled slightly before saying, “Cultivation and abstinence from food are for cleansing oneself, allowing true energy to flow smoothly through the meridians. You haven’t eaten anything these few days, it’s the best time to cultivate and gather your qi. As long as you grasp the technique, stepping on the lotus leaves is not difficult.”</p>
<p>Ranran nodded in realization.</p>
<p>But seeing Senior Brother and Second Senior Brother practicing so hard for so long, she felt that they had only become a bit lighter on their feet when they went down the mountain to collect goods. Could she, a novice with no foundation, really learn such a profound light body technique?</p>
<p>“Practice well. You also know that XiShan and Crimson Gate are enemies. If Wei Jiu comes over, he will surely come for revenge. None of the disciples will be spared. You can’t just smile sweetly at Wei Jiu every time you meet him and expect to escape.” Su Yishui said with a faint disdain in his tone.</p>
<p>Ranran remembered that last time in the woods, she did indeed smile too ingratiatingly at Wei Jiu, losing her righteous demeanor, which made her feel ashamed and also faintly afraid.</p>
<p>This Shifu, who always reminds his disciples that their lives were not guaranteed after joining the sect, was truly rousing. Seeing how reasonable her Shifu’s words were, Ranran suddenly felt motivated.</p>
<p>She went back to her room and put on a thicker chest wrap and changed into thicker pants so that she wouldn’t expose herself even if she fell into the water. Then she returned and memorized the spell for the Light body Technique. She followed Su Yishui to the pond and meditated for a moment by the edge.</p>
<p>After adjusting her breath, she bravely jumped onto the lotus leaf…</p>
<p>There was a “plop,” and her slender body plunged straight into the water.</p>
<p>When her Shifu pulled her out of the water with a spell, dripping wet Ranran lay on the bank spitting out water. Then, coughing, she asked Shifu, “Can I not practice this? Is that okay?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui half squatted in front of her, silent for a moment, then said gently but firmly, “No.”</p>
<p>Although the weather was very cold, the water in the pond was warm, which was the only comforting thing in her unfortunate situation.</p>
<p>In any case, Ranran flopped around in the lotus pond for a full five days. Every day when she went back to rest, she was soaking wet.</p>
<p>Plus, she had been abstaining from food these past days, not even thinking about eating malt sugar to please her mouth. She was beginning to feel that life has lost all meaning.</p>
<p>This morning, after Su Yishui had finished tormenting Ranran, he was in an unusually good mood and took some people down the mountain to visit friends.</p>
<p>Qui Xier couldn’t bear it any longer and asked sighing as she dried little junior sister’s hair, “Ranran, what did you do to offend Shifu? Why is he only making things difficult for you?”</p>
<p>Ranran stared blankly at herself in the mirror. She then straightened her back, trying to cheer herself up. She encouraged herself, saying, “Shifu is not making things difficult for me. He wants to teach me some skills!”</p>
<p>But Qiu Xier didn’t believe it. She raised an eyebrow and asked, “So what have you learned?”</p>
<p>Ranran felt a bit gratified and said, “At least I’ve learned how to swim.”</p>
<p>After falling into the water so many times, she became more proficient at holding her breath. Sometimes when she fell in, she could even paddle a few times. Gradually becoming self-taught, she actually enjoyed swimming with the dog-paddle technique.</p>
<p>While Qiu Xier was drying Ran Ran’s hair, she suddenly exclaimed, “Eeh,” and then leaned down to examine her junior sister’s face closely. She said, “Ranran, why do I feel like your skin has been improving alot recently? Your features have become more refined too.”</p>
<p>Although Ranran had always been prettier than her, she was at best a beautiful girl next door.</p>
<p>But lately, Ranran seemed to be like a pearl hidden in dust, shining from the inside out after being polished thoroughly. Although her features hadn’t changed, there was an indescribable aura emanating from her. Her skin was fair and radiant, making her more and more captivating to look at.</p>

<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>After hearing Qiu Xier’s words, Ranran also checked herself in the bronze mirror and found that her skin had indeed improved a lot.</p>
<p>She recalled what Second Uncle Master had said before, that the ice lotus in the lotus pond was originally a spiritual item that could harmonize one’s spiritual power foundation. Mu Qingge had used it to harmonize Su Yishui’s vitals back then.</p>
<p>Could it be that soaking in the water from this lotus pond was the reason for her improved skin?</p>
<p>Upon hearing Ranran’s guess, Qiu Xier couldn’t help but feel excited and prepared to join Ranran to soak in the lotus pond right away.</p>
<p>If she could get rid of the freckles on her face, it wouldn’t be cultivating in vain!</p>
<p>It happens that today Shifu took Senior Uncle Master and the two Senior Brothers down the mountain to visit friends. There were no men in the mountains, so it wouldn’t be bad to have an open-air skincare bath!</p>
<p>When they arrived at the pond, Ran Ran got changed first into thick chest wraps. She then plunged into the water for a swim around the pond.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier was originally worried about the cold water, especially since it was almost winter.</p>
<p>But seeing Ranran swimming so happily, she tentatively tested the water temperature with her hand. It wasn’t as cold as she had expected. So she impatiently took off her outer clothes, put on her chest wrap, and jumped right into the water.</p>
<p>However, after swimming for a while, Qiu Xier suddenly felt an indescribable chill, creeping into every pore of her body. Before long, she started screaming in horror, shouting, “Quick, I… I’m freezing to death!”</p>
<p>She frantically swam towards the shore while asking Ranran, “Why did the water turn freezing cold?”</p>
<p>Ranran was stunned because she didn’t feel cold at all! She even felt that the water was pleasantly warm, and her entire body felt indescribably comfortable!</p>
<p>But Qiu Xier didn’t seem to be exaggerating. She was shivering uncontrollably in the water, with frost forming on her skin. She looks about to freeze solid!</p>
<p>She couldn’t swim back to shore in time, already feeling her limbs stiffening, half opening her mouth, looking at Ranran in panic, wanting to cry for help but her tongue was already frozen.</p>
<p>Ranran hurriedly swam over, trying to push Qiu Xier back to shore. But with her dog paddle strokes, how could she save someone?</p>
<p>The blood slowly drained from Qiu Xier’s face, she was about to freeze to death. Ranran is really distressed now, she wished that she could carry Xier and fly onto shore.</p>
<p>Just then, the water in the pond surged, especially around Ranran, as if it was boiling. A strange warmth surged from her lower abdomen.</p>
<p>Unable to control it, Ranran suddenly leaped out of the water, lightly landing on a lotus leaf.</p>
<p>She was startled for a moment, but there was no time to think. She reached out to drag Qiu Xier, who was gradually stiffening in the water. But Qiu Xier was quite heavy, and Ranran couldn’t pull her up at all.</p>
<p>At that moment, a white figure flashed before her eyes. Su Yishui suddenly appeared. He waved his long finger and the water surged and pushed Qiu Xier steadily onto the shore.</p>
<p>Second Uncle Master Yu Tong quickly placed her palm on Qiu Xier’s back, channeling her spiritual energy to force out the invading cold from her body. Senior Uncle Master Yu Chen then helped carry the unconscious Qiu Xier back to rest in bed.</p>
<p>The sudden scene shocked the two Senior Brothers who had just returned with Shifu.</p>
<p>Especially Ranran, who was standing lightly on the lotus leaf, her white wet dress sticking to her body, revealing delicate shoulders. Her slightly wet hair clung to her cheeks and neck, while water droplets dripped continuously from her slender ankles and rolled onto the green lotus leaf, all looking…..very mesmerizing.</p>
<p>Ranran hadn’t even reacted yet when Shifu, with an ashen face, suddenly took off his cloak, flew up, wrapped Ranran in it, and brought her back to the shore.</p>
<p>The two male disciples were craning their necks to continue looking, but Su Yishui blocked her from their view, just in time to cover their sight.</p>
<p>Only when they saw Shifu’s piercingly cold gaze did they realize their indiscretion.</p>
<p>Su Yishui coldly said, “There’s nothing here. Go practice on your own!”</p>
<p>Gao Cang and Bai Baishan were originally following Shifu to the grass hall to cultivate their qi. They didn’t expect such an accident to happen at the lotus pond along the way. They also had no idea what had happened.</p>
<p>They shouldn’t say it, but why did little junior sister’s figure look so good?</p>
<p>In their impression, she should be a thin and frail girl. But when her long skirt was wet and clinging to her body, she… really had an enticing figure. Unfortunately, after a brief glimpse, Shifu blocked their view. They could only walk away with lingering regret.</p>
<p>“Why did you take off your clothes to swim? Don’t you know people could pass by here?” After everyone dispersed, Su Yishui with a cold face, picked up the clothes on the ground, wrapped Ranran up like a dumpling, and began to reprimand her.</p>
<p>Ranran had thought they had gone down the mountain and wouldn’t return for a while, but she didn’t expect Shifu to come back at this crucial moment.</p>
<p>Things could have been disastrous just now. She knew she was at fault and could only lower her head and listen to Shifu’s scolding.</p>
<p>Still she couldn’t help but interrupt Shifu’s neverending scolding and asked impatiently, “What happened to Xier? Why did she almost freeze to death?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui obviously hadn’t finished what he was going to say, but seeing Ranran so anxious, he still explained with a stern face, “The lotus pond here grows ice lotuses, which are extremely cold. They have changed the water quality here over these long years, and not everyone can play in the water. You are of the Wood element, needing emptiness within. These ice lotuses are very beneficial for you. But for those who are unsuitable, going in can easily absorb too much cold qi and freeze to death.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Ranran couldn’t help but draw a cold breath. In other words, if Su Yishui hadn’t come back in time, Xier might have been frozen to death!</p>
<p>Seeing her guilty look, Su Yishui softened his tone: “It’s my fault for not explaining clearly to you all. From now on, keep them away from this ice lotus pool. Yu Tong has given Xier a Warming Pill and she was also found in time. She just needs to rest for a while, and she’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>Ranran nodded vigorously. She would never dare to bring Xier to play in the water again. But just now, did she… stand on the lotus leaf?</p>
<p>Now that she had set down her worries, she finally remembered jumping onto the lotus leaf in her moment of desperation.</p>
<p>And Su Yishui looked at her thoughtfully, remarked, “You are naturally lazy, looks like you need some pressure to make progress…”</p>
<p>It seemed that this accident had also opened up insights for Shifu. The teacher, like a cook, had to look at the meat before using the knife. For someone like Xue Ranran, who had no ambition and only thinking about marrying and leaving the mountain, she needed some pressure to improve.</p>
<p>So in the following lessons, it wasn’t just walking on lotus leaves. Su Yishui also brought a wooden barrel of pebbles to throw at Ranran while she stood on the lotus leaf.</p>
<p>Although Shifu didn’t use real force, getting hit by the pebbles was still painful. In order to dodge them, Ranran had to do her best and jump around like a rabbit spirit had possessed her.</p>
<p>As for the other disciples, seeing someone like Xue Ranran who was originally of a constitution unsuited for cultivation, mastering the Light body technique of floating on water in such a short time, was really enviable.</p>
<p>Bai Baishan, who had been wavering in his pursuit of the Dao recently, became more resolute.</p>
<p>He had initially suspected that Shifu was unwilling to teach them real skills, only making them carry sandbags up and down the mountain every day. But now it seemed that Su Yishui was indeed capable. Not only could he deal with the number one demonic cultivator Wei Jiu, but he could also train someone who was useless like the little junior sister into someone so outstanding.</p>
<p>Such a Shifu was truly exceptional! But was Shifu biased? Why was the little junior sister progressing so rapidly while he was not taught real skills?</p>
<p>Two days later, Bai Baishan couldn’t hold back and asked Su Yishui why he didn’t teach them higher-level Cultivation techniques.</p>
<p>Su Yishui glanced at him and said mildly, “In Cultivation, you start from the basics. The higher your Cultivation level, the harder it is to change your foundation. If you regret joining the XiShan Sect, it’s not too late to change now. But if your Cultivation is deeper, and you want to leave, you’ll have to disperse your foundation, which can inevitably damage your tendons and bones. Learning later, is also hoping that you won’t regret it.”</p>
<p>Ranran listened on the side, recalling the previous time when the Jiuhua Sect came to collect things, and the Second Senior Brother was indeed very attentive, and seemed to be trying to build a relationship with Mu Qingge.</p>
<p>Su Yishui had obviously sensed the Second Senior brother’s hidden agendas and thus gave him a reminder.</p>
<p>Bai Baishan didn’t expect that his little schemes had been noted by Shifu. And now, its all laid out in front of all the senior brothers and sisters, so he felt quite ashamed. He quickly declared that he had no intention of changing sects.</p>
<p>Su Yishui looked at him and said mildly, “Many disciples came to join the XiShan Sect at the beginning. Why did I choose you few? It’s because your ancestors have some history with XiShan. Someone owed favors to your elders in the past, and I’m just fulfilling an old promise that person made. However the depth of the master-disciple relationship is beyond human control. If you regret it now, you can leave at any time.”</p>
<p>After saying that, he stood up and walked out of the dining hall.</p>
<p>Obviously, this was also the answer to Bai Baishan’s question – since you entered Su Yishui’s sect, you should follow his rules. If he asks you to carry sandbags every day, then carry them obediently. If you can’t bear it and feel like you haven’t learned anything, the sect is open for you to leave anytime. But if you regret it and want to leave, don’t blame Shifu for taking back the foundation he had taught you!</p>
<p>Ranran bit her chopsticks, feeling that Shifu was also testing her. Once you set foot on the path of Cultivation in Yongcheng West Mountain, it’s not something you can give up just because you want to.</p>
<p>She sighed slightly, wondering how disappointed her parents would be if she didn’t marry, but only focused on cultivating in XiShan. And she didn’t know if they would have more children in the future; otherwise, if they had no one to take care of them in their old age, how could she focus on cultivation?</p>
<p>But Xier didn’t take Ranran’s concerns seriously: “Who said cultivation and marriage can’t go hand in hand? If you reach a certain level, finding an immortal companion is true bliss! Besides, the saying goes, when one person achieves the Dao, even their animals ascends with them. If you truly achieve immortality, why would you worry about your parents having nobody to rely on?”</p>
<p>Ranran wasn’t someone who dwell on worries. After hearing the Third Senior Sister’s words, she felt they made sense. She realized that she had considered herself a useless person in cultivation before, it was her own knowledge that was inadequate.</p>
<p>Now that she had glimpsed the path and entered the sect, she naturally had to focus and first learn self-preservation.</p>
<p>Since Xier fell into the water, triggering Ranran to make her breakthrough and mastered the Light body technique, Su Yishui seemed to have found a great teaching method. He kept raising the stakes for Ranran and even the other senior brothers and sisters ‘benefited’ as well.</p>
<p>On this day, Shifu solemnly announced that he would take them down the mountain to study cultivation!</p>
<p>This matter stemmed from Shifu’s recent trip down the mountain to visit his friend.</p>
<p>On that trip, Shifu met with an old acquaintance from twenty years ago.</p>
<p>This person named Qin Xuanjiu, was now the defending general stationed at the strategic Northwestern town of Wangxiang Pass in Daqi. This time he had come to West Mountain fiercely determined to see Su Yishui.</p>
<p>Su Yishui, however, changed his usual aloof demeanor, and personally went down the mountain to meet him. He even had a hearty drink with him in the pavilion at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>Originally, General Qin was disdainful of drinking with Su Yishui, but it seemed that he had been upset by something and was eager to drown his sorrows in alcohol, becoming quite excitable for a while.</p>

<p>The two senior brothers had been responsible for buying groceries, wine and running errands. They were not able to hear any of the conversation between Shifu and his old acquaintance.</p>
<p>But at the end, when they saw General Qin drinking until his tears and snot flowed, he was no longer aggressive towards Shifu. It seemed that the alcohol had worked its magic, resolving all grievances and enmities in one drunken stupor!</p>
<p>After Xier recovered, Su Yishui proposed taking them along with General Qin to Wangxiang Pass and practice cultivation along the way.</p>
<p>This journey was going to be a little further. Su Yishui gave the instructions and Second Uncle Master, with immense heartache about spending a fortune, bought a carriage with a horse and three swift horses for riding.</p>
<p>The disciples of XiShan no longer needed to measure the distance with their feet, making the journey much easier.</p>
<p>General Qin traveled with a few personal guards alongside them.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until later, when Ranran and the others spoke with General Qin, that they learned he was also a disciple of XiShan (West Mountain).</p>
<p>Others believed that Su Yishui was Mu Qingge’s closed-door disciple. But that wasn’t accurate. Before being executed, Mu Qingge once made an exception and accepted one more disciple.</p>
<p>This General Qin, past forty years old, covered in pockmarks, was Mu Qingge’s closed-door disciple.</p>
<p>Qin XuanJiu became Mu Qingge’s disciple was completely accidental.</p>
<p>Back then, Mu Qingge assisted the Daqi garrison in defending FangYao Pass against the rebellion of Prince Ping in a great battle. It was during that time that she saved the critically wounded Qin Xuanjiu and accepted him as her disciple.</p>
<p>Unlike other disciples who were fresh and tender, General Qin’s rough appearance and pockmarked face did not fit Mu Qingge’s standards for accepting disciples.</p>

<p>Curious, Xier asked the Senior Uncle Master if General Qin was more handsome twenty years ago?</p>
<p>Yu Chen shook his head vigorously, and said that General Qin didn’t look as robust and was even creepier, thinner and uglier back then.</p>
<p>Just then General Qin passed by on his horse, he glared at Yuchen and shot, “My Master didn’t mind my appearance. Who do you think you are to criticize me?”</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that General Qin actually did not get along well with Su Yishui and his two attendants.</p>
<p>Ranran also only learned later, that Su Yishui was actually the illegitimate son of Prince Ping who started the rebellion.</p>
<p>In other words, if Mu Qingge hadn’t intervened, Prince Ping might have been successful in his rebellion and become Emperor. At that time, if Su Yishui was made legitimate, he would have become a  real prince.</p>
<p>Because of this, General Qin, a military officer of Daqi, didn’t have a good opinion of the illegitimate son of the Rebel prince and his attendants. This, coupled with the betrayal incident involving the Master, created new worries and old grudges!</p>
<p>When General Qin cursed, Yu Chen also got upset. With a few words, the two started arguing on horseback.</p>
<p>Yu Chen cursed, “Look at yourself in the mirror. With your appearance, Mu Qingge must have been so drunk and made a mistake when she accepted you!”</p>
<p>As his Master had been killed shortly after he joined the sect, General Qin Xuanjiu had always been upset that he couldn’t be recognized officially and return to his roots in the sect.</p>
<p>Now, hearing Yu Chen point out his weaknesses, he became livid. He took out a pair of golden hammers from his bag and preparing to fight Yu Chen to the death.</p>
<p>Ranran watched the spectacle from the carriage by their side for a while, and seeing that they couldn’t resolve it, she hurriedly smiled and comforted the angry general.<br/>“General Qin, my Senior Uncle Master is just joking with you, playing around. One can see that you clearly have extraordinary foundation, a rare talent for cultivation. Moreover, the disciples of Xishan belong to the Wood element. Your name has the character ‘wine,’  just like my Shifu’s name has ‘water,’ which is beneficial for Wood energy. Grandmaster Mu must have thought that your life lot will be good for her, so she accepted you as a disciple.”</p>
<p>These were just conciliatory words, but when General Qin heard them, he looked at her in amazement, tears welling in his leopard eyes, and said, “……My Master said the same thing back then. How did you know, little girl?”</p>
<p>Um… Ranran could only awkwardly smile and say that she was just talking nonsense, and if there was any resemblance to the truth, it was purely coincidental.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this unintentional talk aroused General Qin’s nostalgia for his esteemed Master, so that night, he sought out Su Yishui by the riverside camp to drink, getting very drunk again.</p>
<p>Ranran found the subtle interaction between these seemingly opposing fellow disciples very profound.</p>
<p>Considering their opposite attitudes toward their former Master, Mu Qingge, but they were still able to travel together peacefully, was truly unthinkable. However, she didn’t know what circumstances had linked these two together, leading them to Wangxiang Pass in the Northwest.</p>
<p>But very soon, she found out the reason.</p>
<p>Allowing his disciples to relax along the way, as they were approaching Wangxiang Pass, he looked at the dark clouds that have gathered and asked his disciples, “Do you know the mystery behind the name ‘Wangxiang’?”</p>
<p>Bai Baishan never missed a chance to show off his knowledge of cultivation texts and immediately said, “The Three Realms are divided into Heaven, Earth and Human Realms. Among them, the Earth Realm is the realm of death and forgetfulness. It is said that before the dead souls enter the underworld, they have to linger in Wangxiang Valley for three years, waiting to resolve their lingering thoughts from the human world, forget their ties before they can reincarnate from the underworld.”</p>
<p>Su Yishui nodded, indicating that his second disciples’s words were correct. Then he continued, “Originally, Wangxiang Valley did not overlap with the human world. But twenty years ago, during the Fangyao Battle, there were too many casualties. Together with the secret opening of the Netherworld, the balance between Yin and Yang was disrupted. The Yin energies of Wangxiang Valley leaked out and overlapped with the surface, turning Wangxiang Pass into a place of heavy Yin energy. Coupled with being a key border town, there are always conflicts here. The Yin energy, nourished by grievances, has even bred many Yin demons. Your purpose in coming here is to assist General Qin in subduing demons and eliminating evil.”</p>
<p>Gao Cang, the passionate young man, was excited and eager, filling with impatience. But the other three disciples became wide-eyed with fear.</p>
<p>Bai Baishan cautiously asked, “Shifu, besides cultivating and building foundations through meditation and carrying sandbags up and down the mountain, we haven’t learned anything else! Now that we’re in such a perilous place, what abilities do we have to subdue demons and eliminate evil?”</p>
<p>Ranran also nodded vigorously by the side. Besides pill alchemy, she had only practiced bouncing on lotus leaves. If Shifu brought them some minor demons for them to practice on, it would still be fine. But now that they were in a place full of Yin demons, won’t they would just be swallowed up whole by those demons instead?</p>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu stood aside with disappointment: “Since when have disciples of XiShan Sect become so cowardly and afraid of death? Think about how impressive my Master used to be. How did you produce such timid disciples? This is really not giving her any reason to be proud!”</p>
<p>Yu Chen coldly snorted, “What does Master’s disciples have to do with that female demon?”</p>
<p>But obviously, arguing was of no help in improving their skills. Su Yishui’s disciples lacked confidence and had no assurance of saving any dignity for XiShan’s Lingxi Palace.</p>
<p>Su Yishui tried to reassure his disciples by comparing their experiences with Ranran’s Light body technique: “If you want to make rapid progress in cultivation, you must face life-threatening situations. This kind of situation is exactly a great opportunity for your advancement, so you must cherish it even more.”</p>
<p>Ranran was a bit unsure whether the master meant for them to cherish the opportunity for advancement or cherish the remaining time of their lives.</p>
<p>However, seeing Su Yishui’s serious expression, it was clear he wasn’t joking. The disciples, who had been enjoying themselves along the way, reluctantly began memorizing the techniques for Subduing Demons and practicing their skills of pasting talismans.</p>
<p>Qiu xier would cry while practicing, then wipe her tears and continue.</p>
<p>Ranran wanted to cry with her, but fearing it would waste time, she could only pat her choking senior sister on the back and say, “Be good, recite the Thirteen Techniques for Demon-Slaying with me again.”</p>
<p>In short, *the inadequate disciples managed to cram in some knowledge by **rote learning before reaching the Main gate of Wangxiang Pass. They more or less learnt the basic skills that they were going to use when facing demons.<br/>*<strong>赶鸭子上架</strong> : <br/>比喻强迫去做能力达不到的事情 <em>forced to do something they are not capable of doing</em><br/>**<strong>囫囵吞枣</strong>:<em> literal- swallowing the whole date without chewing – learning without analyzing at all</em></p>
<p>They also learned about the strange events that occurred at Wangxiang Pass two months ago. It turned out that just two months ago, an entire camp of Qin Xuanjiu’s soldiers went missing while patrolling along the Wangxiang River.</p>
<p>The border had been calm for a while with no conflict, so Qin Xuanjiu immediately sent people to search for the missing soldiers.</p>
<p>But the soldiers who returned were all deathly pale and some spoke incoherently, only saying they were all in the river.</p>
<p>When Qin Xuanjiu went to see for himself, he found the naked bodies of thirty-six soldiers floating on the river’s surface, their armor and clothing neatly stacked by the riverbank.</p>
<p>It looked as though they had collectively decided to throw themselves into the river.</p>
<p>But Qin Xuanjiu didn’t believe it at all. Several of these thirty-six soldiers were trained by him personally, all of them were straightforward and brave men. Two of them had families at Wangxiang Pass, and they were even about to become fathers.</p>
<p>Before they set off for the patrol, they had joked, eaten and drank together, saying they would continue the celebration when they returned. How could they have done such a senseless thing?</p>
<p>The mystery of these deaths by drowning had not been solved, and similar strange events had subsequently occurred at Wangxiang Pass.</p>
<p>Rumors began to spread, suggesting that Qin Xuanjiu had mistreated his men so much that they couldn’t bear the humiliation and chose to die by drowning with grievances.</p>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu couldn’t defend himself, so he took soldiers to guard the river for three nights, but nothing unusual happened. This seemed to further confirm the accusations of mistreatment of soldiers.</p>
<p>Right when he was inexplicably accused, he suddenly remembered something and quickly retrieved an Bagua compass from behind the portrait of his Master, Mu Qingge.</p>
<p>Looking at it, he saw that the yin and yang on the compass were completely reversed, things were out of order.</p>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu remembered his Master’s instructions when she gave him this compass, saying that if there were anomalies on the compass, he must look for Su Yishui. So, he temporarily put aside his grudges against Su and went to West Mountain to find him, asking him to come and resolve the crisis at Wangxiang Pass and took the chance to vent some of his pent-up resentment towards Su Yishui.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for the vow he made to his esteemed Master never to make things difficult for Su Yishui, he really wanted to kill this ungrateful *white-eyed wolf with one swing of his blade!<br/>*白眼狼<em> raised someone ungrateful</em></p>
<p>But Qin Xuanjiu didn’t expect that Su Yishui, while a rascal as a disciple, was even worse as a Master. He had actually sent out his newly initiated disciples as sacrifice for evil spirits.</p>
<p>In the vast yellow sands of the northwest, watching a few young people wrapped in borrowed military uniforms like dumplings, standing pitifully by the Wangxiang River like abandoned children, Qin Xuanjiu asked uncertainly, “Is it really okay to leave them here for the night?”</p>
<p>Over the past two months, there had been three consecutive inexplicable incidents of soldiers drowning. Was it really alright to leave behind four rookie cultivators who were still so green by a dark river?</p>
<p>Su Yishui nodded and took out a stack of something from his pocket, handing it to Ranran.</p>
<p>Ranran took a look and found that it was a stack of green paper cut into lotus leaves…</p>
<p>Su Yishui said, “If you feel something is wrong, throw these into the river.”</p>
<p>“Master, are these Thunderbolt Spirit Talismans capable of subduing demons and eliminating evil?” Ranran asked hopefully.</p>
<p>However, Su Yishui shook his head. “It’s too cold here, and lotus leaves can’t grow in the river. With these, you can use Light body technique to avoid drowning…”</p>
<p>This kind of answer made Ranran’s little face fall—she was afraid she might be ensnared by some evil spirit and lose her senses, simply won’t remember to use light body techniques to step on lotus leaves.</p>
<p>Moreover, these green oiled paper lotus leaves seemed too perfunctory, right? They were Master and disciples, at least provide some real lotus leaves!</p>
<p>After instructing them, with a wave of his sleeve, Su Yishui left without taking any disciple with him, and went to the city.</p>
<p>Although Qin Xuanjiu sympathized with these young people, he couldn’t persuade Su Yishui, so he also shook his head and left with the soldiers.</p>
<p>The imperial envoy had already entered the Pass, and Qin Xuanjiu had to deal with those annoying lawsuits. But he consoled himself a little—if Su Yishui’s disciples also drowned, it would at least prove that it wasn’t his mistreatment of soldiers that led to their suicides by drowning.</p>
<p>In recent days, coffins in nearby towns had been in high demand. He wondered if their Master would be willing to spend a large sum of money to prepare some good funeral items for them…</p>
<p>Second Senior Uncle, Yu Tong, felt sorry for her nephews and nieces and left them with two warm military tents, fire starters and a bundle of firewood for keeping warm at night. As she left, she sighed helplessly, telling them to take care and strive to have a reunion breakfast the next day.</p>
<p>When everyone had left, only four fellow disciples remained, looking at each other.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier said with a sullen face, “My mother said she sent me up the mountain to cultivate immortality, but she didn’t say I would be fed to evil spirits! Big Senior Brother, Second Senior Brother, should we think of a solution ourselves?”</p>
<p>With a loud clang, Gao Cang drew out his sword that had been passed down his family, and said with determination, “Third Junior Sister, don’t be afraid. If there are truly evil spirits or demons, I will fight to the death to protect you all!”</p>
<p>Ranran was more practical. She borrowed the sword from her eldest senior brother, to open up the bundle of firewood. She then made a fire for them to keep warm, roasted some sweet potatoes and drumsticks that she had prepared, to pass this long night in the northwest.</p>
<p>After the firewood burned into embers, Ranran tossed the sweet potatoes into it and soon a sweet fragrance filled the air. Adding to that the drumsticks marinated with coarse salt and spirits on the grill, these naive young men and women couldn’t help but swallow continuously, setting aside their fear for a while.</p>
<p>After the drumsticks were grilled, Ranran mysteriously took out a wine bag from her pocket. “You’re in for a treat. I brought this from the Western Mountains…” Gao Cang took a sniff and widened his eyes, “So fragrant? What kind of wine is this?”</p>
<p>Ranran smiled and said, “I brewed it myself. If it’s nice, have a few more sips. It’ll warm you up.”</p>
<p>She made this wine, called “Detain Heaven’s Immortal” brewed following the instructions in the ‘Playing Classics’. She had been hesitant to bring it out for fear of her Shifu recognizing it.</p>
<p>Now with only her fellow disciples left, it was the perfect time to fortify their spirits against the cold.</p>
<p>The night in the northwest was very cold, but Ranran was dressed warmly. Inside her thick cotton military coat, she wore a small floral jacket her mother had made for her. Although it made her look plump like a roly-poly doll, she felt really warm when she drew her neck into the woolen collar.</p>
<p>After enjoying the delicious food and wine, everyone’s dantian felt warm.</p>
<p>Bai Baishan told some jokes at the right time, making everyone laugh heartily. This didn’t seem like demon hunting anymore but more like an excursion. Ranran started singing folk songs from the mountains, her beautiful and clear voice echoing in the wilderness, soothing everyone’s hearts.</p>
<p>Coupled with the exceptionally mellow wine, they forgot what fear was, completely immersed in the excitement and laughter of youth.</p>
<p>Coming from a military family, Gao Cang, after taking a sip of “Detain Heaven’s Immortal,” poured a cup into the river to honor the fallen soldiers.</p>
<p>These brave spirits buried in the mountains had sacrificed themselves for their country. How could he drink alone?</p>
<p>The night was too dark for Gao Cang to notice that when he poured the wine into the river, bubbles began to emerge from the calm surface.</p>
<p>After they finished eating, they each returned to their tents to sleep, but such an atmosphere made sleep elusive. So, they decided to meditate in their tents to calm and restore themselves.</p>
<p>Ever since Ranran took the Clear Heart Pill she refined some time ago, after over ten days of fasting, she suddenly felt some breakthroughs.</p>
<p>During meditation, she no longer felt unbearable back pain. When her breathing and the flow of energy throughout her body synchronized, she really felt a sense of connection with the world.</p>
<p>Her hearing also became much sharper, able to hear the distant howls of wolves on the mountain and the sounds of rodents digging holes not far away.</p>
<p>In short, all sounds were amplified endlessly, while she herself gradually became calm amidst the cacophony…</p>
<p>Suddenly, Ranran opened her eyes wide and whispered, “There’s a sound in the river…”</p>
<p>To be precise, it was an almost inaudible song. Vaguely, the lyrics seemed to be something like “Returning home…”</p>
<p>When she looked at Qiu Xier next to her, she realized Xier had already opened her eyes, staring blankly at the river outside the tent.</p>
<p>Ranran called out to her several times, but Xier remained unresponsive, completely ignoring everyone.</p>
<p>At that moment, Ranran heard the bubbling sounds from the river seem to grow louder. Qiu Xier stood up suddenly, and walked out of the tent.</p>
<p>Ranran quickly got up and followed her out, finding that the two senior brothers from the other tent had also come out.</p>
<p>Their eyes were vacant, clearly in the same state as Qiu Xier, walking blankly towards the Wangxiang River.</p>
<p>Ranran continued calling out to them, but they did not turn back. When they reached the riverbank, the three of them started to undress and neatly fold their clothes, placing them by the shore.</p>
<p>The uniformity of their movements was absolutely chilling and goosebumps inducing. This scene was exactly as General Qin Xuanjiu had described before!</p>
<p>Realizing that if she didn’t do something right now, they would soon take off their underwear and shoes, and jump into the river, Ranran quickly picked up a new piece of firewood, made a torch from the still-burning firewood pile, and ran to shine it towards the river.</p>
<p>When the firelight illuminated the area, she saw large bubbles emerging from the river, but she could not tell what was in the water.</p>
<p>Turning back to look at those who had fallen under the spell, Ranran bit her lip, suddenly recalling something. She took out the Clear Heart Pills she had refined from her pocket. Then she poured three of them into her mouth, chewed them into pieces, and put them into their mouths.</p>
<p>Ranran wasn’t sure if it would work, but she remembered Shifu saying that the simpler the pill, the purer its effects.</p>
<p>For example, the Clear Heart Pill she used at the entry-level was not only helpful for cultivating and fasting but also lived up to its name, calming the mind and resisting mental disturbances.</p>
<p>Although her Shifu had never explained, Ranran speculated randomly that the pills she made with the alchemy furnace used by Mu Qingge before, was itself a divine item that focused spiritual energies. It had higher demands towards the user of the furnace, and must not mix in distractions which could completely disrupt the control of the pill’s effects.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of this, the pills she first made, with distractions mixed in, were so overbearing that they ruined her Shifu’s three years of fasting.</p>
<p>Now, the pills she refined were made during her meditation, with fewer distractions. Today, out of desperation, she could only try giving them to see if they would work.</p>
<p>The crushed pills melted in their mouths. Even without swallowing, they flowed down their throats. Just as they were about to take off their inner wear and shoes, the Clear Heart Pills finally took effect.</p>
<p>Bai Baishan was the first to come to his senses. He shivered in the cold wind, then looked down at the neatly stacked pile of clothes, feeling somewhat dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Next, Qiu Xier came around as well. She first saw the under-dressed appearance of the two senior brothers, then looked down at herself, realizing she was only wearing her undergarments. She immediately screamed in embarrassment and anger, then quickly squatted down to pick up her outer clothes and put them back on.</p>
<p>Senior Brother was awakened by Third Sister’s scream, looking foolishly at his fellow disciples, and stuttered, “Wha… what’s going on?”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran had no time to explain, so she just pointed to the river and said, “There’s something strange in the water, quickly move away from the river.”</p>
<p>At this moment, the three who had just awakened also saw the roiling water bubbles on the surface of the water, so they quickly picked up their clothes and shoes and hurriedly retreated.</p>
<p>Perhaps because the three controlled individuals resisted the evil power and woke up in time, the river now became even more turbulent, even starting to emit water sprays that gradually turned into numerous rising streams of water, which rushed towards the shore as if to drag these few young people into the water.</p>
<p>“Quick, set up the formation!” Ranran shouted quickly.</p>
<p>The other three immediately formed the Demon-subduing formation taught by their Shifu, drawing talismans with their hands in front of their chests, while the four of them formed a *’Pin’-shaped formation. *品</p>

<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>According to their Shifu, once the formation was set up, they could support each other and face the enemy more calmly. The so-called demons were just a kind of creature that absorbed yin energy. </p>
<p>As long as they remained calm, observed carefully, discover the vital points of these creatures, they could use their swords to subdue the demons and uphold righteousness.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these few novices were using this technique for the first time. Some were fast, some were slow. Qiu Xier was panicking and completely uncoordinated. In the end, she didn’t run to her position and even tripped and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>When she exclaimed as she fell, the demon-subduing formation, which was fine just now, revealed a gap. The water stream also seemed to have noticed this weak point and suddenly attacked Ranran.</p>
<p>“It” had just used a spell to bewitch the minds of people, and while the other three were all affected, only this young girl was not affected at all. She even had a way to awaken the other three.</p>
<p>So “it” decided to deal with this troublemaker first, before dealing with the remaining three.</p>

<p>Ranran was caught off guard and swept up by the water stream. Although Senior Brother drew his sword to chop at the water stream, cutting at the water only made it flow more vigorously, and he couldn’t intercept Ranran, who was swiftly being swept away.</p>
<p>Just as Ranran was about to be pulled into the water, she pulled out the thick stack of green oiled paper lotus leaves and scattered them on the river surface like a *heavenly maiden scattering flowers. *天女散花</p>
<p>Upon touching the water, the seemingly ordinary green oiled paper, suddenly emitted thousands of streaks of golden light. These lights quickly connected to form a vast net, woven from the numerous pieces of green oiled paper, tightly covering a large area of the river surface.</p>
<p>As the golden light formed a net, a sharp and miserable howl suddenly came from the river. The water stream holding Ranran also suddenly loosened its grip and she was about to fall into the water.</p>
<p>With her life hanging on a thread, the technique she had memorized by heart came into play. Ranran used the Light body technique and landed steadily on the lotus leaves made of oiled paper.</p>
<p>The mysterious power in the water continued to struggle, extending water streams like tentacles. Ranran, who had been trained by Shifu to dodge stones, now agilely leaped back and forth like a little rabbit, dodging very timely.</p>
<p>When she managed to get a moment, Ranran shouted loudly at the three dumbfounded people on the riverbank, “Quick! Form the attack formation!”</p>
<p>The three were stunned by Ranran’s extraordinarily agile movements. Usually lazy and always goofing off, she had only been enthusiastic about cooking and eating. But their little junior sister actually possessed such light and nimble skills!</p>
<p>Only when they heard their little junior sister’s reminder did they react and hurriedly proceeded to fell into formation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they were too slow to react. The power in the river had rallied again, breaking through the golden net to once again envelop Ranran.</p>
<p>At this critical moment, a white cat rushed out from the nearby bushes and transformed into a fierce Gengjin white tiger in an instant, roaring as it pounced toward the strange waves.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the situation, Ranran somersaulted onto the back of the white tiger. The Geng jin white tiger firmly planted its four paws on the lotus leaves made of oiled paper and fiercely bit towards the foaming area of the river surface.</p>
<p>Under the shining golden light of the lotus leaves, Ranran noticed that the white tiger was biting at the area where the foam was churning vigorously. There was a rending wail, and black water emerged from there.</p>
<p>Ranran understood that this area of foaming bubbles is the vital point of this water demon.</p>
<p>She shouted again for Senior Brother to throw her his sword . This time, Gao cang finally reacted quickly and threw the long sword in his hand to Ranran.</p>
<p>Sword in hand, Xue Ranran rode on the back of the tiger, clasping its waist with her legs and moved back and forth with the white tiger. Whenever she saw a foaming area on the river surface, she fiercely stabbed into it with her sword.</p>
<p>As she had guessed, there was resistance when the sword pierced into the water, and it indeed hit something!</p>
<p>Soon, the disturbance in the water became weaker and weaker. Although the unknown water demon was dodging everywhere in the water, it couldn’t match the speed of the white tiger. It was soon covered in wounds from Ranran’s sword. It let out a loud splash, and then dived into the river bottom to escape.</p>
<p>When the white tiger carried Ranran back to shore, Qiu Xier rushed to the front, agitatedly hugging Ranran and said, “Junior sister, you’re amazing!”</p>
<p>The other two senior brothers also gathered around and praised their junior sister’s bravery.</p>
<p>However, Ranran felt a bit embarrassed; she knew her own limitations. If it weren’t for the lotus leaves made of oiled paper covering the river surface and the help of the white tiger, she would have fallen into the river long ago.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, although she injured the water demon with the help of the white tiger, it fled so quickly. She didn’t know if it would come back and cause chaos again.</p>
<p>Just as the four were still in shock, the water surface suddenly churned again, but this time with even greater momentum, the waves surged straight into the sky.</p>
<p>Obviously, the demon had returned and its power was even more violent now. The oil paper lotus leaves on the river surface were quickly swept away without a trace.</p>
<p>Ranran looked up at the huge waves, feeling a tightness in her chest. She felt that even if the white tiger was powerful, it would not be able to enter the river in such a violent wave.</p>
<p>Just as the giant waves were about to slam down on the river surface, suddenly, as if blown by a violent wind, they were abruptly stopped.</p>
<p>In the sweeping whirlwind, a figure in white robes suddenly appeared.</p>
<p>The youths all looked closely and shouted in unison, “Shifu!”</p>
<p>It turned out that Su Yishui appeared just in time and conjured a whirlwind spell to stop the giant waves. He held a random branch picked from somewhere in his hand, and  seemed to casually thrust it into the center of the giant waves, and another earth-shattering wail sounded.</p>
<p>The water on the river surface then retracted, and it seems like the demon intended to escape again. However, Su Yishui held a random fishing net from somewhere. He threw it onto the river surface and pulled it back, actually pulling out a humanoid creature with fish scales and gills from the water. With a twist of his wrist, he slammed it fiercely onto the shore.</p>
<p>With this, the giant waves also fell heavily, crashing back into the water.</p>
<p>Ranran held the sword with both hands, nervously facing the “monster” that Shifu had thrown onto the shore. Upon closer inspection, she found that it looked very human, and it was a woman with a rather beautiful face.</p>
<p>With the exception of “her” face, “it” was covered in scales all over its body, even its fingers were webbed, and there were fish gill-like things on the sides of its cheeks.</p>
<p>There was a gaping hole in its chest, oozing black blood, and its cheeks were also full of scars.</p>
<p>Ranran guessed that the bubbles earlier were from the monster’s gills, so the two gills should be the ones she had cut, and the fatal wound on its chest should have been inflicted by Shifu.</p>

<p>Seeing that Shifu did not abandon them and leave, but was silently standing guard nearby, Ranran’s heart was full, and she looked ardently towards Shifu.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Shifu did not seem to feel the ardent gaze of his disciple. He came over with a cold face and spoke harshly to her, “In the Ninth Technique of Subduing Demons, it is said that when in danger, one should first protect oneself and not chase after enemies. Why did you risk your life just now, fighting it while riding on the white tiger?”</p>
<p>This… Ranran was a bit at a loss for words on where to begin refute his words. If they started at the beginning, she had been in danger only because Shifu had left them here in the first place!</p>
<p>However, according to the news rules of the XiShan Sect, everything Shifu said is correct. Ranran could only humbly accept the lesson and promised that she would definitely escape when she could, should they fight demons again.</p>
<p>Seeing that his disciple was still receptive to his teaching, Su Yishui finally stopped looking stern and turned his head to look at the injured monster.</p>
<p>“Shifu, what kind of exotic beast is this?” Bai Baishan couldn’t recognize it, so he asked.</p>
<p>“She’s not a monster, just a woman who practiced Beast Taming Technique and became possessed.” </p>
<p>Beast Taming Technique? Ranran had heard about it when Second Uncle Master talked about the Summary of Spells. It was a technique to merge oneself with the body of a beast, aiming to change one’s ordinary mortal attributes.</p>
<p>For example, merging with tigers and leopards could give sharp claws and swiftness in movement. This woman had obviously merged with a fish-like aquatic creature, gaining the features of a fish, allowing her to cause trouble in the water.</p>
<p>At this moment, Su Yishui lowered his head with a cold face and asked the strange woman, “Why did you lure soldiers into the river?”</p>
<p>The woman’s mouth was already oozing blood, and she reached out in fear as if seeking help, “I… I had no choice, save……save me…”</p>
<p>Xi’er looked at her pitifully. Feeling sorry for her, she took out hemostatic medicine powder, wanting to apply it for her.</p>
<p>But as soon as she squatted down, the woman suddenly revealed a murderous intent. Her webbed fingers suddenly grew sharp thorns and fiercely stabbed towards Xi’er’s neck.</p>
<p>Clearly, this woman knew that she did not have long to live, so she wanted to take someone along with her if she could.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Su Yishui extended his long leg and kicked Xi’er aside, narrowly avoiding the attack.</p>
<p>The woman’s scheme failed, she only smiled grimly and glared at Ranran. Suddenly, her voice, which had been feminine, became low and terrifying, completely different from her voice before: “Why… aren’t you controlled? Who are you really…”</p>
<p>Before she could finish her words, she died. The originally red pupils gradually dissipated, becoming dark and murky.</p>
<p>Just then, as the sky was getting brighter, Qin Xuanjiu rushed over with his men on horses.</p>
<p>Seeing the strange-looking fish-woman, Qin Xuanjiu’s brows furrowed, “How could such a monster appear in Wangxiang River?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui pointed to a tattoo of a talisman-like pattern on her neck and said, “Someone was controlling her. Even after being injured, she can come back again. Such reckless fighting also seems a bit involuntary…”</p>
<p>Ranran squatted down carefully, looking at the talisman, which was different from what Shifu usually taught. This was very complicated, and seemed to have some ancient text that was difficult to understand.</p>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu frowned, “Someone is controlling her? For the sake of harming people’s lives? What’s the benefit?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui looked at Qin Xuanjiu and said mildly, “With your kind of brain, how did you manage to remain an official until now?”</p>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu didn’t expect Su Yishui to attack him suddenly with such sarcastic words, which made him so angry that his belly bulged up and down. He was about to retort when Ranran, who was thinking by the side, whispered thoughtfully, “Yeah, what’s the benefit? Naturally, it’s to destabilize General Qin’s position. Wasn’t there already an imperial envoy sent to investigate General Qin?”</p>
<p>This silenced Qin Xuanjiu. Because the fact was just that. If he was convicted of mistreatment of his soldiers and causing them to commit suicide, he would definitely be punished and sure to lose his position.</p>
<p>But who would go to such lengths to frame him? After all, being a small city defense general was not a glorious position. Being stationed in such a poor and remote place, many military commanders would want to avoid it!</p>
<p>Su Yishui looked at the endless Wangxiang River and said to Qin Xuanjiu, “Your Master once entrusted you with the task of remaining at Wangxiang Pass, because this is where the Yin and Yang converge, a place of obscurity. If there are any anomalies, they will definitely begin from here. Someone went to great lengths to get rid of you, probably thinking that your presence was hindering them.”</p>
<p>Thinking of the instructions from his Master, Mu Qingge, Qin Xuanjiu felt fire in his heart. He clenched his fists, declaring, “I absolutely will not leave Wangxiang Pass!”</p>
<p>Before he finished speaking, Su Yishui suddenly reached out and grabbed Qin Xuanjiu’s collar, throwing him into the river.</p>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu struggled to stand up, already becoming completely soaked. He wiped the water off his face and roared furiously, “Su, what are you doing?!”</p>
<p>Su Yishui maintained the demeanor of a Master, calmly saying, “Helping you resolve your current lawsuit.”<br/><br/>……</p>

<p>When Qin Xuanjiu ordered the body to be carried into the city, it was already bright daylight, and the road leading into the city was bustling with merchants. Along the way, the onlookers were shocked by the scene.</p>
<p>As for the earlier rumors about Qin Xuanjiu mistreating the soldiers, they were naturally debunked — it turns out there was such a monster enticing the soldiers to jump into the river! Fortunately, General Qin showed his bravery by entering the river and killing the monster. Truly deserving of the title of a brave and heroic general!</p>
<p>With such a mighty General stationed there, it was a blessing for the people! Watching the drenched Qin Xuanjiu return to the city, its clear that he had personally fought the water demon in the river.</p>
<p>The people eagerly cheered for General Qin, creating a lively scene. If it weren’t for the guards protecting him, they might have even knocked down the Imperial Envoy Li, who was standing in front.</p>
<p>As for the disciples of XiShan, they kept a low profile and quietly entered the city with the crowd. They then went to a porridge shop to have breakfast.</p>
<p>However, Gao Cang felt a bit disappointed. Looking at the distant cheering crowd, he felt that the flowers and accolades should have been for them.</p>
<p>Ranran comforted her senior brother, “If it weren’t for Shifu, we would be floating on the river now, probably also carried into the city and watched by a crowd. So, sitting together like this having breakfast is better than being a spectacle.”</p>
<p>After hearing her junior sister’s words, Gao Cang recalled the danger of last night. He quickly drank the porridge to calm himself, feeling that this blissful moment did not come easy.</p>
<p>Ranran also attentively served some side dishes to her senior brother.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Ranran suddenly noticed Shifu staring at her, with great displeasure in his eyes. Not understanding why, she quickly placed some food into Shifu’s bowl with her chopsticks as well.</p>
<p>Usually, Su Yishui didn’t like eating outside food from street vendors or restaurants. However, seeing his disciple serving him out of filial piety, he reluctantly ate it slowly.</p>
<p>Ranran silently noted down in her heart: Shifu doesn’t like disciples serving each other dishes; at the dining table, we should only serve Shifu!</p>
<p>Although Shifu didn’t say it explicitly, but another peculiar rule from XiShan was added.</p>
<p>After accepting their heroes welcome, Qin Xuanjiu reported to Envoy Li about last night’s battle. When Li saw the half-human, half-fish monster, he was quite horrified.</p>
<p>He came here intending to bring charges against Qin Xuanjiu; there were instructions from above, hoping General Qin would relocate. Originally, everything was falling into place; even though there were no soldiers in the camp accusing him of cruel treatment, the deaths of so many people in two months were strong evidence.</p>
<p>But who would have thought that in just one night, Qin Xuanjiu would suddenly catch a water monster from the Wangxiang River. Now, the soldiers’ inexplicable actions of jumping into the river had an explanation; it was this water monster’s ability to enchant hearts, luring the soldiers to lose their senses and jump into the river.</p>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu said he had already written a report and had it expedited to the emperor. The body of this female water monster would also be wrapped in lime to prevent decay and sent to the capital.</p>
<p>As for being framed for mistreating soldiers, he officially objected to accusation and had already requested his former superior — the current Minister of War, General Zhou Dao — to seek justice for him.</p>
<p>Envoy Li, knew that now charging General Qin and investigating him would seem untenable. The Emperor would surely be alerted to such a strange incident and likely to prompt deeper inquiries.</p>
<p>So, he couldn’t immediately convict him as planned; he had to report back first and then make new plans.</p>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu had just sent away the envoy when one of his subordinates hurriedly reported that the village’s chief constable, while watching the water monster’s body being paraded, recognized her as the missing widow Yue’e from their village.</p>
<p>This widow took on the task of delivering meals to the nearby military outpost for construction work, cooking three meals a day near the military outpost’s large stove with three women from the village.</p>
<p>But three months ago, she suddenly disappeared and never returned. At that time, it caused quite a stir; her elder brother even said that soldiers in the camp fancied his sister’s beauty, which is why they abducted and imprisoned her.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, when they saw her again, not only was she dead, but she also turned into that ghastly appearance, which was truly frightening! The chief constable felt this matter was significant and didn’t dare to conceal it, so he immediately reported it to General Qin.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Su Yishui asked if there could be a mistake.</p>
<p>The chief constable thought for a moment and said affirmatively that the female demon had a black mole on her cheek, identical to Yue’e’s, which was too coincidental.</p>
<p>Su Yishui then inquired about what kind of person Yue’e was in daily life.</p>
<p>The chief constable said disapprovingly, “She was young and could have married a young man, but she chose to marry the 80-year-old rich widower in the village. Unfortunately, less than a year after their marriage, the old man died. She conspired with her brother to try to take over the family’s fortune but was ousted by the old man’s daughter, as she did not manage to birth a child. She failed miserably and became a laughingstock in the village, so she went to work at the military outpost to make a living.”</p>
<p>Knowing that this water demon was an ordinary village woman just three months ago made the situation even more suspicious.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Su Yishui asked the chief constable to summon the women who worked with Yue’e.</p>
<p>The chief constable nodded and called the women who worked with Yue’e to the General’s residence for questioning.</p>
<p>At first, these women were a bit fearful, but once they saw Su Yishui, their eyes widened in astonishment— my my, there’s a man who looked like a handsome immortal from a painting, how is he so handsome!</p>
<p>Ranran, seeing this and fearing that they were staring at him for too long, which may annoy Su Yishui, stood in front of them and waved her hand, saying, “Excuse me, do you know Wang Yue’e?”</p>
<p>These women, after recovering their senses, looked at the young girl in front of them — My my, how could she also be so beautiful?</p>
<p>One of the women said honestly, “We know her, but we don’t know who kidnapped her. It’s been a long time since we’ve seen her.”</p>
<p>Ranran asked again, “Do you remember the last time you saw Yue’e? When was it?”</p>
<p>After thinking for a while and discussing with each other, they finally remembered. It was at the beginning of the month, three months ago when Yue’e had dressed up nicely, put on a new dress, and said she was going to the town to buy things. She rode on a donkey and went by herself.</p>
<p>Listening to the women’s words, it didn’t sound like she was buying things but rather meeting a man in secret.</p>
<p>So, when she didn’t return for a long time, they speculated privately that Yue’e had eloped with a man. But it was strange because during those days, they were so busy working in the military outpost, cooking for over fifty craftsmen three times a day; where would she find time to meet a man? Could she have met a man from the army camp?</p>
<p>But she insisted on dressing up every day, wearing pretty dresses, looking very cheerful, and occasionally standing by the Wangxiang River, smiling foolishly.</p>
<p>After further questions, nothing substantial could be gleaned from the women. Furthermore, based on Yue’e’s daily activities, it seemed to have nothing to do with any activities linked to sinister spirits or talismans.</p>
<p>Why did she suddenly mutate into a demon who killed countless people?</p>
<p>However, as for who was behind this female water demon, that needed to be thoroughly investigated. Otherwise, if similar events happened again, innocent soldiers would be killed. To investigate thoroughly was quite simple; all they needed to do was examine the origin of the talisman symbols on her neck.</p>
<p>Su Yishui had already instructed Yu Tong to copy down the symbols for him to search through ancient texts. But after a thorough search, he still couldn’t find anything similar.</p>
<p>There was another thing that Ranran couldn’t understand. If the water demon wanted to frame General Qin, why were those three nights he was on duty peaceful?</p>
<p>Regarding this, Su Yishui had an explanation. He mildly said, “His destined lot is good; he was born in the Year of the Cat and can escape nine dangers. The three days that he was on duty happened to coincide with a cold wave, which caused the Wangxiang River to freeze. The water demon absorbs water vapor to generate her power, she will hibernate when the water surface freezes.”</p>
<p>After hearing this, Ranran looked at General Qin with respect. Such a great fortune was truly rare. However, General Qin had already risked his life on the battlefield many times before; who knows how many of these nine lives he had left?</p>
<p>As for why Mu Qingge had made an exception to accept such an ugly disciple, could it be because she saw value in his remarkable destiny lot?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As for this incomprehensible talisman, it seemed they needed to find an expert to decipher it.</p>
<p>Su Yishui remembered a person, conveniently living not far from the Wangxiang river in the Cuiwei Mountain, which can be reached in a day.</p>
<p>That person was an expert in taslimans; consulting him might provide some clues.</p>
<p>So Su Yishui, accompanied by his entourage and disciples, went to visit. Qin Xuanjiu also followed them.</p>
<p>After a day’s journey, when they reached the foot of Cuiwei Mountain, there was a cultivated farmland, and as far as the eye could see, it was filled with lush green wheat seedlings and vast patches of sweet potato seedlings.</p>
<p>Bai Baishan looked at the farmland in shock and muttered to himself, “Now… isn’t it almost winter? How are these seedlings growing so well?”</p>
<p>This place was not the water-rich region of Jiangnan, and approaching winter, barren fields were the norm; how could there be such fresh wheat seedlings?</p>
<p>Gao Cang saw several farmers wearing straw hats weeding in the fields and walked over to inquire.</p>
<p>But no matter how he called out, that person didn’t respond. Gao Cang got a little angry and reached out to pull the person.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the person was as frail as paper glued together; with a little force, the person fell straight down.</p>
<p>Scared, Gao Cang also jumped, then quickly squatted down to help the person. But when he turned the person over, Gao Cang screamed in horror and jumped up again.</p>
<p>It turned out that person… was actually made of straw, dressed in clothes and wearing a hat, but there were no eyes or nose on the face, just lying there like that, scaring the living daylights out of people.</p>
<p>Ranran was also startled; she stared at the “people” working in the field and found that their movements were stiff, each one emitting a strange bizarre vibe.</p>
<p>Just then, a strong wind blew, and several “people” floated along with the wind, spinning in the air. When the wind subsided, those “people” fell to the ground again, picked up their hoes, and continued working methodically.</p>
<p>It seemed that these “people” were all made of straw. Ranran noticed that there were talismans attached to their backs, apparently someone was controlling them to work in the fields.</p>
<p>At this moment, a crow suddenly landed on one of the straw figures, tilted its head, carefully scrutinizing Su Yishui and his group. It then opened its long, sharp beak and cawed, “Who goes there?”<br/></p>

<p>Su Yishui glanced at the talisman tied to the crow’s foot. Clearly someone was controlling the bird to come and inquire about their identities.</p>
<p>So he replied, “Xishan Su Yishui, here to visit Elder Jiu.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing Su Yishui’s name, the crow suddenly jumped up, flapping its wings and said, “Bastard Su Yishui, won’t see won’t see!”</p>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu, listening from the side, developed a newfound appreciation for this Elder Jiu, whom he had never met. At the very least, they shared a mutual dislike for this Su guy.</p>
<p>Su Yishui was not annoyed; he reached out in a flash, somehow grabbed the crow’s neck, and then took out their copied water demon talisman, and held it in front of the bird. He said, “This was obtained from a woman practicing Beast Taming. Sir, I would like to ask, do you know its origin?”</p>
<p>The crow, upon seeing the talisman, widened its eyes massively and forcefully broke free from Su Yishui’s hand. In a sharp voice, it asked, “How is this possible? Someone actually knows about this…”</p>
<p>It was clear that the person controlling the bird was in a dilemma. The crow landed on the back of a straw figure again, pacing anxiously, then finally made up its mind, “Alright, come to the Grass Hall on the mountain.”</p>
<p>So Su Yishui and the others followed the crow’s lead and climbed up the mountain.</p>
<p>The road up Cuiwei Mountain was really steep, they can see that not many people came here. If it were in the past, Ranran would definitely not be able to make it up. Fortunately, her Light Body Technique had become more proficient; she effortlessly leaped and hopped up the steep slope like a deer on her tiptoes.</p>
<p>As for Gao Cang and Bai Baishan, who were used to their Shifu’s punishments back in Xishan, their legs were agile from training with sandbags. It was only poor Xier who couldn’t make even halfway up and had to stay at the foot of the mountain to wait for their return.</p>
<p>The mountain became even more steep, so Qin Xuanjiu, Yu Chen, Senior brother, and Bai Baishan couldn’t go any further and had to stay behind.</p>
<p>In the end, only Su Yishui and Ranran climbed up the mountain.</p>
<p>Actually, Ranran didn’t want to continue the climb a while ago. It wasn’t because she was tired, but she felt that it would be nice to stay with her senior brothers halfway up the mountain, have some of her drinks, eat some dried jerky and biscuits that she brought, and enjoy the scenery.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Shifu didn’t allow her to stop. In the end, he even held her waist and carried her along, riding on the wind, and quickly arrived at the mountaintop.</p>
<p>The mountaintop of Cuiwei Mountain was also lush green, with a simple grass hall nearby and several barns filled with sweet potatoes and wheat.</p>
<p>The air was filled with the fragrant aroma of sweet potato wine, and a short old man was turning the brewing materials in front of a wine vat.</p>
<p>Seeing the visitors, the old man, with a nose covered in yeast, snorted, “I wondered why another barrel of wine went bad today? Turns out a Disaster star was coming!”</p>
<p>Su Yishui didn’t mind the old man’s peculiar temperament; he just stood in the courtyard, waiting for the Elder Jiu to come over to talk.</p>
<p>The Elder Jiu seemed to not know Su Yishui. After angrily smashing the spoiled wine vat, he limped over, scrutinizing Su Yishui from head to toe, “You look quite decent! No wonder that Mu girl was so bewitched, you made her suffer so terribly!”</p>
<p>It seemed the old man was an old friend of Mu Qingge’s and harbored great animosity towards Su Yishui, the rebellious disciple. Then, he rudely gave Xue Ranran the once over, and asked coldly, “And who might you be?”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran bowed politely and softly said she was Su Yishui’s disciple, causing the Elder Jiu’s eyes to widen in surprise.</p>
<p>“What can you learn from someone who betrays their Master and ancestors? Young girl, you’ve gone astray at such a young age!” the Elder Jiu retorted.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran couldn’t find a rejoinder so she could only pretend to inspect the surroundings, slipping away to the side.</p>
<p>Su Yishui seemed to understand the elderly man’s eccentric nature and didn’t engage in a verbal argument. Instead, he took out the copied symbols of the talisman and said, “Old Sir, you seem to recognize this talisman. Could you tell me their origin?”</p>
<p>The Elder Jiu circled him a few times, before reaching out for the talisman, carefully examining it. They couldn’t quite tell if his face showed a mix of nervousness or excitement, but he laughed almost breathlessly, “That Mu girl did her very best to seal the breach caused by the Netherworld spring. But in the mouths of those righteous folks, it became her causing trouble in the mortal world! A scapegoat, indeed. *<em>‘Picking hundreds of flowers to make honey, for whom do they suffer, for whom is it sweet’</em>! But your retribution came swiftly! Aren’t you self-proclaimed righteous people? Let’s see who else will be as foolish as that Mu girl, to give their all to save you from the breach opened by the Netherworld this time !”<br/>*采得百花成蜜后，为谁辛苦为谁甜 <br/><em>A poem that praises the great virtues of hardworking bees and criticizes those who benefit from the hard work of others</em></p>
<p>He laughed maliciously, but his words left Xue Ranran bewildered.</p>
<p>According to this elderly man, was Mu Qingge actually a good person before? Was there something more to her privately breaking into the Spiritual spring and releasing the demon lord?</p>
<p>But seeing him mock Shifu like this, Xue Ranran couldn’t help but step in to defend her master: “Old Sir, what you’re saying isn’t fair. When the chaos of Yin and Yang arrives, who could keep to themselves? And can you just stay hidden here making wine? Besides… your wine-making isn’t right! You’ve wasted so much grain for nothing!”</p>
<p>The Elder Jiu was the younger brother of the renowned Grand Medicine Immortal who ascended long ago. Due to his love for wine, he had delayed his progress in cultivation and, despite living to two hundred years old he was always one step away, still yet to achieve immortality.</p>
<p>The old man was uninterested in the first half of Xue Ranran’s words but took great offense at her remark about how his “wine-making isn’t right”. </p>
<p>He has boasted that he had tasted the best wines in the world and was not only a connoisseur but also skilled in brewing. How could this silly young girl dare say his wine wasn’t brewed right?</p>
<p>The Elder Jiu jumped up, angrily asking, “What’s wrong with it? If you can’t explain yourself, watch me knock you down the mountain with one strike!”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran, who was bored earlier, had smelled the wine from the broken jars on the ground and picked up a piece, taking a small sip.</p>
<p>Upon tasting it, she immediately recognized the wine… It was an attempt to copy the renowned “Detain Heaven’s Immortal” from the “Playing Classics”. However, the timing of adding ingredients during fermentation was wrong, and the fermentation temperature was off, leading to a deviation in taste.</p>
<p>Actually, the wine itself wasn’t bad, but since Xue Ranran had tasted the genuine “Detain Heaven’s Immortal” she had brewed following the recipe, she naturally found this imitation extremely awful.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran stole a glance at her Shifu, weighed the pros and cons, and decided that resolving the water demon issue was more important right now.</p>
<p>So she asked the Elder Jiu in a low voice if he was trying to brew the “Detain Heaven’s Immortal”. The old man was astonished, staring at her with wide eyes and asked, “What? Have you heard of this wine before?”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran nodded and handed him the wine gourd by her side.</p>
<p>This was the last of “Detain Heaven’s Immortal” that she had brought; the rest had been consumed by her senior brothers while they were keeping watch by the river.</p>
<p>The Elder Jiu was initially skeptical but, upon opening the gourd, was hit by a strong aroma of wine. He couldn’t resist tasting it and completely disregarding if the wine might be poisoned, he just drank it without any thought. After savoring a sip, his eyes lit up. He quickly took several more big gulps.</p>
<p>In just a few gulps, he finished the wine. Longing for more, he smacked his lips in satisfaction, and asked, “Young girl, how do you have such authentic ‘Detain Heaven’s Immortal’?”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran honestly replied, “I brewed it. If you like it, I can help you brew some.”</p>
<p>The Elder Jiu, hearing this, jumped back, “Nonsense! Nonsense! Only Mu Qingge knows how to brew this. How could a young girl like you know it?”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran felt he was getting drunk and cautiously hid behind her Shifu, showing only half of her little face and said in a small voice, “It’s just wine, not some elixir of immortality. Why can’t I know how to brew it?”</p>
<p>This remark made the Elder Jiu start stomping his feet in fury once more. It was this wine, that he had only tasted once and could never forget. But despite spending twenty years studying it painstakingly, he just couldn’t replicate the taste again.</p>
<p>Now, a young girl spoke to him with such disdain, as if the wine was ordinary well water, isn’t she mocking him for being stupid?</p>
<p>But after jumping around for a while, the intoxicating taste of the wine that lingered on his tongue was too much. How could a few mere sips satisfy his craving? The Elder Jiu stopped jumping and solicitously directed his words behind Su Yishui, “Young girl, I couldn’t confirm the authenticity of the flavor just now. Give me another pot to taste.”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran remained hidden behind her Shifu, refusing to come out. She muttered, “I don’t have any left. But if you tell my Shifu about the origin of that talisman, I’ll brew you a vat.”</p>
<p>The Elder Jiu raised his eyebrows and glared at Su Yishui, his tone unfriendly as he said, “I heard that you saved Mu Qingge in the end and guided her soul to the tree?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui nodded and replied mildly, “She has safely reincarnated.”</p>
<p>The Elder Jiu let out a gratified sigh, believing this statement immediately. It seemed that after living in seclusion for so long, this man had forgotten that people can be deceitful, revealing a childlike innocence.</p>
<p>The Elder Jiu was pondering in his mind: he and Mu Qingge were old friends who bonded over wine. If Mu Qingge had died at this kid’s hands, he would rather never satisfy his craving than strike a deal with this kid.</p>
<p>But since Mu Qingge was still alive, making a very small deal with Su Yishui wouldn’t be considered betraying their friendship of the wine cup.</p>
<p>Thinking this, he couldn’t suppress his wine craving any further , and he confidently said, “As long as you teach me how to brew this, I’ll tell you everything I know about these symbols and talismans.”</p>
<p>However, brewing wine wasn’t something that could be done overnight. Even under ideal temperature and humidity, it would take at least seven days.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran indicated that it would take a very long time, but her Shifu’s situation couldn’t wait, so could the Elder Jiu tell them first. Elder Jiu proudly laughed and presented a porcelain wine vat covered in mysterious talismans. </p>
<p>According to Elder Jiu, while a day passed in heaven and a year passed on earth, this vat also has control of time. A day passes outside this vat, while a year passes inside the vat.</p>
<p>However, such manipulation of time was extremely draining on spiritual power. The vat full of talismans actually condensed half of the Elder Jiu’s lifetime of spiritual power.</p>
<p>This kind of absurd manipulation of time might explain why his elder brother, the Grand Medicine Immortal, ascended long ago while the Elder Jiu remained in Cuiwei Mountain, growing sweet potatoes to make wine.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran thought to herself, engaging in such frivolous pursuits… no wonder he and her former Grandmaster are birds of a feather!</p>

<p>With the blessing of this treasure vat, the wine was brewed quickly. Following the steps from the “Playing Classic,” Ranran meticulously mixed the ingredients, her movements fluid and seamless, completing the process in one go.</p>
<p>The vat was also quite amazing. In just a short while, the aroma of wine started seeping through the sealed oil paper.</p>
<p>Elder Jiu excitedly took a sip, confirming it was indeed the desired taste. Now, he looked at Ranran as if she were a treasure, impressed by the skills of this young girl.</p>
<p>Worried that he might get drunk, Ranran hurriedly reminded him of his promise. Elder Jiu urgently took several big gulps more and then squinted, saying, “This talisman is the Seven Evil Transformation Spell. When used, it can transform a person into a beast, greatly enhancing their spiritual power. At the same time, the caster can also drive the target to extreme demonic transformation, a very powerful ability… This talisman is too domineering and wicked. It’s said not to belong to the human realm, merely used to manipulate desires and amplify greed… See here, what are these two characters?”</p>
<p>Ranran, with her three years of private school education, couldn’t hope to understand. Su Yishui glanced at it and said, “This is Sanskrit.”</p>
<p>Elder Jiu nodded, “Since tens of thousands of years ago, it was said that the Netherworld Spring had breached three times. During the last disaster, a group of Tian zhu people worshipped the Spiritual spring as a deity and founded a demonic sect called the Fantian Sect. These symbols were charms used by the sect members to enhance their spiritual power. They didn’t need to cultivate their foundations or Qi; they just needed the blessings from talismans, to grant them tremendous power like the water demon you encountered. This is why some speculate these talismans’ symbols are manifestations of the Spiritual spring’s power, used to seduce and manipulate people for its own ends…”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Ranran immediately thought of that Yue’e. She was also a greedy person; who knows if she fell to some temptation and so turned into that inhuman state?</p>
<p>Elder Jiu, sipping his wine, sighed ruefully, “All these people… their greed is too great, choosing not to remain humans… But the Fantian Sect was wiped out a hundred years ago in the battle of righteousness and evil. How could something like this still be circulating?”</p>
<p>Ranran was also puzzled: if these talismans were long lost, why did they appear in the Wangxiang River?</p>
<p>Could it be that the Netherworld Spring has breached again, creating these talismans to beguile people?</p>
<p>If the water demon had been deliberately created by someone, with the aim of driving away Qin Xuanjiu who guarded Wangxiang Pass, it was likely for opening a dangerous rift between the Yin and Yang realms, with intention to bring forth chaos.</p>
<p>Thinking about how her Shifu once gave Wei Jiu the key to the Netherworld Spring, Ranran couldn’t help but wonder if this had something to do with Wei Jiu?</p>
<p>Just then, Elder Jiu went into the house and brought out a small wooden box. Opening it revealed a velvet-wrapped… finger-sized small bottle?</p>
<p>The bottle was exquisite, with delicate patterns that also seemed like talisman symbols, its jade-like material shimmering with a faint light.</p>
<p>“Back when Mu girl was possessed by the Spiritual spring, she barely managed to escape it but she had no way to send it back to the Netherworld. She could only seal it temporarily with a Soul-Hosting Stone. I don’t know where she hid it. However, the Spring’s power will grow over time, even if sealed, it won’t last long. Once the stone cracks, it will summon many evil spirits… This is the Sky-Mending Jade that Mu Qingge had asked me to find. It’s made of millennium ice and condensed into spiritual jade. This was all there is of it, made into this small bottle. Unfortunately, she was gone when I finished it… If you ever have the chance to find the Soul-Hosting Stone, use this to contain the Spiritual Spring. It’s sturdier than the stone.”</p>
<p>Saying this, Elder Jiu handed the small jade bottle to Ranran. Clearly, he didn’t think much of Su Yishui, but seeing the evil talisman he brought, he knew the Spiritual spring that Mu Qingge had sealed might be causing trouble again. If he ignored this, he probably couldn’t live peacefully either and drink wine every day anymore.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Spiritual spring was Mu Qingge’s unresolved regret, so after some thought, Elder Jiu decided to give the bottle to this young girl, who he felt a connection with.</p>
<p>Since there was nothing else to inquire further, Su Yishui was about to leave with Ranran.</p>
<p>Elder Jiu felt a special affinity with this young girl and took the opportunity as she was leaving to give her a small cloth pouch.</p>
<p>“Besides being a wine connoisseur, I’m also skilled in drawing talismans. This pouch contains some protective charms. Perhaps you might need them. After all, following an unfortunate master like yours, you might get into trouble too. If things go wrong, be smart and escape first. If you’re not happy following this Su, you can seek refuge in Cuiwei Mountain with me. My abilities far exceed those of Su Yishui!”</p>
<p>Elder Jiu openly played the villain, trying to poach Ranran in front of Su Yishui.</p>
<p>Ranran looked at the red-nosed Elder Jiu and forced a dry laugh, not wanting to upset her Shifu, she hurriedly followed Su Yishui down the mountain.</p>
<p>On the way down, she voiced her suspicions and carefully asked, “Shifu, when you gave the key to Wei Jiu, weren’t you afraid that after obtaining the Spiritual Spring, he might come back for revenge?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui glanced at her and replied, “The Spiritual Spring is no longer in the Netherworld. Even if he goes, it’s just to see the scenery. He gave up so much of his cultivation to me; it’s only right to send him for a break.”</p>
<p>Although Ranran had already suspected that there must be something more to the key, she didn’t expect her Shifu to be so mean.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu with half of his golden core gone… when he goes searching for the Spring only to find a dried-up waterhole, his androgynous face must have turned purple with anger, right?</p>
<p>However, the Fantian Sect, exterminated a hundred years ago, had no survivors. If it was really the Spiritual spring that breached again, and using evil talismans to beguile people, how could they find out where Mu Qingge hid the Spring?</p>
<p>After hearing Ranran’s question, Su Yishui counter-questioned, “Where do you think Mu Qingge would hide it?”</p>
<p>This… although Ranran thought it would be more straightforward if her Shifu asked Mu Qingge directly, she still thought about it carefully and replied, “Mu Qingge had specifically instructed General Qin to guard this place, and this human-turned-demon, also appeared at Wangxiang Pass. That means the Soul-Hosting Stone should also be here.”</p>
<p>When they reached the foot of the mountain, Su Yishui briefly explained the situation to Qin Xuanjiu and then asked, “When Mu Qingge asked you to guard Wangxiang Pass, did she also tell you what you are guarding?”</p>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu raised his eyes as if trying to recall, then said somewhat evasively, “At thet time, Master was severely injured from battling the demon lord in Fan Yao’s Great Battle. She needed time to recuperate and saw many disciples buried here without any family to care for their graves. So she ordered me never to leave this place and to regularly tend their graves. That’s why I repeatedly turned down Lord Zhou’s offer to promote me to the capital and stayed here.”</p>
<p>Su Yishui listened to this, then asked mildly, “What else do you need to do while stationed here?”</p>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu hesitated for a moment and said, “Apart from tending the graves during Qingming Festival, every year on the first and fifteenth day of the month, I need to replenish the lamp oil in the temples I was tasked to build by Master, in the order of east, west, south, and north. This keeps the lamps in these temples lit, comforting the souls of the fallen warriors…”</p>
<p>These were clearly insincere words of evasion. It seemed Qin Xuanjiu was still wary of Su Yishui and didn’t want to reveal the truth.</p>
<p>So no matter how Su Yishui asked next, Qin Xuanjiu kept his mouth tightly shut behind his beard.</p>
<p>Seeing that Qin Xuanjiu didn’t want to tell him, Su Yishui didn’t press further. However, when Su Yishui was about to leave with his disciple, Qin Xuanjiu became anxious.</p>
<p>“The mastermind behind this hasn’t been caught yet, why are you in such a hurry to leave? If they regroup and break through… what should we do?”</p>
<p>Ranran found General Qin’s behavior very amusing, so she spoke softly, “General Qin, if you want my Shifu’s help, you must be willing to share what you know. Besides, your Master once entrusted you to seek help from Su Yishui if there’s anything unusual here, right?”</p>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu scratched his beard, feeling relieved as he finally spoke, “Back then, she subdued the demon lord and also took his Netherworld Spiritual Spring. Unfortunately, because Master nearly got controlled by it, she spent alot of effort in order to free herself. Later, Master said she sealed it somewhere in the Wangxiang Pass.<br/>In order to prevent it from causing chaos in the world again, someone has to guard it always. When my Master accepted me as her disciple, she was already practicing dangerously close to demonic cultivation. The Soul Transference Technique she used was a profound art that could reverse the heavens and earth, shifting the stars themselves. If not controlled properly, the demonic nature within one’s body would surge uncontrollably. Initially, in order to suppress the demon lord, she used this technique to transfer most of his demonic nature and a large portion of his spiritual spring energy away. However, the demonic nature of the spiritual spring was too strong, and even my master struggled to contain it. Eventually, she devised a method. On the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month, using the peak of Yin energy at Wangxiang Pass, she transferred the demonic nature and power onto a Soul Hosting Stone, sealing it thereafter. My duty was to guard this Soul Hosting Stone, but I truly do not know its whereabouts. My master only instructed me to diligently observe the BaGua Compass; if anything unusual occurred, I was to seek you out…” </p>
<p>Second Uncle Master Yu Tong couldn’t help but sigh when she heard this. Previously, she had believed that the female demon Mu Qingge had been tempted by powerful magic, which led her to dabble in the dark arts. Now, after hearing General Qin’s words, she realized how deeply misunderstood Mu Qingge had been by the world back then.</p>
<p>However, if she was trying to restrain the demon lord, she could have sought help from the orthodox sects. Why was she unwilling to explain her actions to anyone? And what was the purpose to send Qin Xuanjiu to look for Su Yishui to solve the breach of the Spiritual spring?</p>
<p>At this point, Qin Xuanjiu was already shedding tears uncontrollably, he continued: “But she was already weak at the time, and ambushed by the accursed righteous factions, resulting in her tragic death… You bastard! You were there but did nothing to stop it, allowing them to bully my master!”</p>
<p>As Qin Xuanjiu spoke, he couldn’t contain his grievances any longer and he wanted to kick Su Yishui. Yu Chen hurriedly intervened, but he also did not know what to say.</p>
<p>Ranran glanced at her expressionless Shifu and felt that beneath his calm exterior, he wasn’t as indifferent as he appeared. But as his disciple, she could only try to smooth things over.</p>
<p>“General Qin, there were so many people back then, and my Shifu can hardly fight them alone! Besides, he did his best to preserve GrandMaster’s soul and helped her to reincarnate on the Rebirth Tree. Now, GrandMaster Mu has been reborn and is doing well… By the way, why didn’t you go to Jiuhua Mountain to look for her?”</p>

<p>At Ranran’s words, Qin Xuanji’s sobbing intensified, and he said with his wet beard, “Of course I went to look for her! But my Master spent twenty years on the tree so her memories are a bit confused. She said she doesn’t remember me anymore!”</p>
<p>After hearing that Mu Qingge had reincarnated, Qin Xuanjiu was so excited that he hadn’t slept for several nights. Before looking for Su Yishui, he had been inquiring all the way, leading him to Jiuhua Mountain.</p>
<p>But it seemed that his reborn Master was busy and had no time to see him.</p>
<p>Later, Qin Xuanjiu finally managed to run into Mu Qingge at the foot of the mountain, when she returned from Xishan. She looked at his pockmarked face in surprise and then laughed, saying she did not remember him. Could it be that he took her joke seriously and thought of himself as her closed-door disciple?</p>
<p>After all, everyone knew that Mu Qingge only took in disciples who were good-looking; being too ugly would hurt her eyes.</p>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu had wanted to say more to jog his Master’s memory but was impatiently driven away by the disciples of Jiuhua Sect.</p>
<p>So when Qin Xuanji went to Xishan to look for Su Yishui later, he cried his heart out while drowning his sorrows in alcohol. Even Su remembered him, why did his Master forget him?</p>
<p>Seeing General Qin so distressed, one can’t help feeling bad to see a grown man cry. Rannan contributed her small handkerchief to let General Qin wipe his tears and comforted him, “GrandMaster Mu may have forgotten things, and can’t remember you, but she will definitely not forget about important matters like the Soul Hosting Stone! As long as you guard Wangxiang Pass and repel those with evil intentions, when she recalls everything later, she will surely feel that she didn’t misjudge you and be glad she accepted someone as outstanding as you as her disciple!”</p>
<p>As Rannan spoke, her eyes sparkled, looking at Qin Xuanjiu with sincerity.</p>
<p>For some reason, Qin Xuanji felt a sense of relief and thought this did make sense. After all, his Master had been hanging on a tree for twenty years; how could he expect her to come back exactly the same as before?</p>
<p>The most important thing now was to guard the Soul Hosting stone and not screw up the task his Master had given him.</p>
<p>Now that they have discovered the motives of those behind the scenes, Master and disciples couldn’t go home for now. They had to slowly search for where the Soul Hosting stone was hidden.</p>
<p>So they settled into a house arranged by Qin Xuanjiu in the town near the Pass.</p>
<p>The adventure on Wangxiang River had made the young ones aware of their shortcomings. They might face even fiercer battles in the future and couldn’t always rely on the tiger and their Shifu Su Yishui to bail them out every time.</p>
<p>So every morning, even before dawn, they would practice swordplay, meditate, and work on cultivating their foundations.</p>
<p>Since Rannan had figured out the key to Pill refinement alchemy, Qiu Xier’s alchemy furnace had almost been idle. No matter how she practiced, the pills she made were not as potent as Rannan’s. Since Rannan wasn’t selfish about it, Qiu Xier simply became lazy and used the pills Rannan made to consolidate her foundation and cultivate her Qi.</p>
<p>Even though they were just basic Clear Heart Pills, they were very nourishing. Qiu Xier’s heart ailment had not recurred for a longwhite. So….. Shifu could now train his female disciples equally. In the early mornings, they would run laps with their two senior brothers.</p>
<p>In the words of their Second Uncle Master, without strong legs, they could stumble again in the next battle during formation. Something as foolish as tripping oneself up when subduing demons was simply humiliating!</p>
<p>To redeem themselves, they had to run ten laps around the river every morning.</p>
<p>But Rannan didn’t find it very tough. As Shifu said, once they mastered the essentials of foundation building, cultivating and regulating Qi in the dantian would make you feel light and agile. Covering a thousand miles in a day wouldn’t be just a myth.</p>
<p>Watching their little junior sister bouncing around like a little rabbit at the front of the group, while the three of them behind were slightly panting, only able to call out, “Little junior sister, wait for us!”</p>
<p>Rannan turned around and smiled, “You guys are too slow. I still have mushroom meat buns steaming on the stove in the kitchen! I’ve already finished ten laps, so I’ll go back first. You guys continue running!”</p>
<p>With that, Rannan ran towards Wangxiang Pass on her own.</p>
<p>It was early in the morning, and the Pass was open. Merchants doing business had already lined up early to pass through the inspection.</p>
<p>However, a team with magnificent horses and carriages stood out, escorted by soldiers, bypassing the queue and heading straight below the Pass. A military commander riding on a horse in front shouted loudly, “By the decree of His Majesty, the JiuHua Battle Goddess and Immortal Mu Qingge is requested to investigate the case of the demon at Wangxiang Pass. Quickly summon General Qin Xuanjiu to receive the decree!”</p>
<p>The man who shouted wore the official uniform of the Capital’s *Imperial Guards, with an Official plaque hanging from his waist and holding a shining imperial decree in his hand.<br/>*<em>Imperial Guards, also known as the Forbidden Troops</em></p>
<p>The city guards dared not delay and hurried to find General Qin Xuanjiu inside the Pass.</p>
<p>Rannan squeezed into the crowd, curiously watching the beautifully crafted wooden carriage. Just then, a gust of wind blew, lifting the curtain of the carriage, revealing Mu Qingge’s beautiful face.</p>
<p>The onlookers erupted into exclamations, whispering to each other, “Oh my, there is actually such a handsome young lady. Could it be that the Jiu Tian Fairy has descended from heaven?”</p>
<p>The people inside the carriage naturally heard the commotion. Mu Qingge seemed to enjoy the ordinary praises and raised the curtain further, looking out with a cool expression.</p>
<p>The crowd exclaimed, “WAH!” and they got even more excited, calling out “Look, it’s a fairy!”</p>
<p>At this moment, Mu Qingge smiled, ready to lower the curtain. But in the midst of her gaze sweeping around, she suddenly saw Rannan standing in the crowd. Her eyes paused, and she got off the carriage.</p>
<p>The soldiers cleared the way and dispersed the onlookers, as Mu Qingge beckoned for Rannan to come closer to talk.</p>
<p>“You… are Yishui’s little disciple, called Xue Rannan, right?”</p>
<p>Because Qin Xuanjiu had told them of Mu Qingge’s unknown hardships, Rannan felt very sympathetic towards this female demonic cultivator who had been misunderstood by the world.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Mu Qingge’s question, Rannian respectfully bowed and said, “Yes, that’s me. May I ask why Immortal Mu has come here?”</p>
<p>Mu Qingge looked at Rannan in a manner as how one would look at a junior, smiling benevolently, “You’ve come… has your master also come?”</p>
<p>Rannan felt that she couldn’t casually reveal her Shifu’s whereabouts. After all, their relationship was unclear, with unresolved grievances. So she just smiled foolishly and didn’t speak.</p>
<p>Seeing her like this, Mu Qingge didn’t get angry but instead held Rannan’s hand and smiled gently, “I once had a younger sister named Mu Ranwu, just like you, with the word ‘Ran’ in her name. Unfortunately, she’s no longer with us. But seeing you, it’s as if I can see her again, like a little stooge always following me around…”</p>
<p>As she spoke, Mu Qingge’s expression carried an indescribable sense of melancholy, as if talking to herself, “She never left my side, always leaning on me for everything…”</p>
<p>Then she turned her gaze to Rannan and said with a smile, “Although we’ve only met a couple of times, I always feel a sense of affinity with you. I really like you, child. If we consider it, you can be considered my grand-disciple. Calling me ‘Shi zu’ sounds too old, so just call me ‘Grandmaster.'”</p>
<p>Rannan learned from Qin Xuanjiu about the undisclosed truth of the past and also knew that this Grandmaster was not as bad as the righteous sects portrayed her. However, her over-familiar manner and deliberate move to establish a relationship made Rannan feel a bit uncomfortable. Ranran wasn’t a child who becomes friendly with anyone easily. Having her hands held by someone she wasn’t very familiar with felt awkward.</p>
<p>So she discreetly pulled away and took a step back, saying, “Immortal Mu, I still have a pot of buns steaming. I shall take my leave first!”</p>
<p>With that, she dashed away, heading back to deliver the message to her Shifu.</p>
<p>Watching the little girl abruptly run off without observing proper etiquette, Lin Yeting, the newly acquired wealthy disciple of Mu Qingge and the son of Prime Minister Lin, frowned slightly. “How is Su Yishui’s disciple is so lacking in manners! She runs off before finishing her words! But then again, Su Yishui has always been arrogant. It’s not surprising that he would produce such rude disciples.”</p>
<p>Lin Yeting had suffered from severe rheumatism and had once sought medical help from Xishan but was turned away. Su Yishui’s attendant had mercilessly mocked and insulted his father, accusing him of being corrupt, causing him to be utterly humiliated. However, due to the large crowd gathered then, he couldn’t retaliate, so his resentment towards Su Yishui was immense.</p>
<p>Fortunately, with Mu Qingge’s rebirth, his father, being the Prime Minister, had been entrusted by the Emperor to personally visit Mu Qingge. He then pleaded with her to relieve his son’s illness.</p>
<p>Although Mu Qingge had been hanging on a tree for twenty years, she was well-versed in human affairs and showed great benevolence. Not only did she remove Lin Yeting’s pain with her spells, transferring his rheumatism to one of his servants, but she also gladly accepted him as her disciple, allowing him to cultivate some body strengthening techniques.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Lin had always been concerned about his son’s frail health, so naturally, everyone was pleased with the situation. Lin Yeting knew that Mu Qingge was a person highly regarded by the Emperor, so he put aside his noble status and diligently studied under Mu Qingge, not for immortal cultivation but following the Emperor’s instructions to have a reliable person by Mu Qingge’s side. If Mu Qingge needed anything, it had to be arranged promptly, showcasing the Emperor’s favor.</p>
<p>However, his brown-nosing just now clearly fell flat. Hearing Lin Yeting mock Su Yishui, Mu Qingge’s gaze turned cold, and after giving him a glance, she rebuked, “Xishan was established by me, and Yishui is also my disciple. If we think about it, he’s your Senior brother. How can you speak rudely and mock your senior?”</p>
<p>Lin Yeting quickly apologized with a bow. But Mu Qingge’s attention had already shifted away from him, focusing on the general with a face full of pockmarks who was briskly walking out of the city gate.</p>
<p>This person… she had seen him before! He had once claimed to be Mu Qingge’s closed-door disciple and tried to establish a kinship with her at the foot of Jiuhua Mountain… Could he be Qin Xuanjiu, the commander of Wangxiang Pass?</p>
<p>With that thought, Mu Qingge put on a smile and walked towards that tearful pockmarked face…</p>
<p>Leaving behind the tearful scene of Master and disciple acknowledging each other at the city gate, Rannan ran all the way back to the small courtyard where they were staying, ready to report to her Shifu.</p>
<p>But to her surprise, after searching the courtyard, she found her noble and refined Shifu actually in the kitchen, rolling up his sleeves and using bamboo tongs to take out the buns from the steaming iron pot!</p>
<p>Hmm… With her Shifu having to carry out such mundane tasks, it seemed like the disciple had been negligent in service. Rannan hurried over, circling around Su Yishui, “Oh dear, Shifu, are you hungry? Let me serve the buns for you!”</p>
<p>But Su Yishui said he wasn’t hungry. Its just that she had mentioned before that when the buns are done, they should be kept for only *fifteen minutes more in the pot, exactly.<br/>*半炷香 <em>the time it takes to burn half a stick of incense</em></p>

<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>When he saw that the time was up and she hadn’t returned yet, he decided to take out the buns first to avoid overcooking and affecting the taste.</p>
<p>Rannan was moved, her Shifu was so attentive, remembering every word she said!</p>
<p>So she quickly picked a bun with a red mark on it, blew on it, and handed it to her Shifu, “Shifu, you don’t like chopped green onions, so these with red marks are filled with a different filling that I made. Try it while it’s hot and see if it suits your taste?”</p>
<p>After saying that, she couldn’t wait and picked up one herself, broke it open, let out the steam, took a big bite, and then looked eagerly at her master, motioning him to eat while it’s hot.</p>
<p>The corner of Su Yishui’s lips curled slightly, like a smile but not. Following her example, he opened the bun, and ate it slowly one bite at a time.</p>
<p>After the master and disciple finished one bun each, not letting down the aroma of the buns fresh out of the pot, Rannan suddenly remembered the proper business, and quickly relayed the news about Mu Qingge’s visit to Wangxiang Pass with the imperial decree.</p>
<p>Although she suspected that her Shifu had a complicated relationship with Mu Qingge, her master seemed calm and composed right now, seemingly not agitated at all. He just used his chopsticks to pick up another bun and asked Rannan to prepare some sauce for dipping.</p>
<p>Rannan was meticulous, following the ratio in “Playing Classics” she prepared an oil and vinegar sauce for her Shifu.</p>
<p>This time it seemed to suit Shifu’s taste, as he leisurely dipped the sauce and ate another bun. Then, he suddenly asked, “How did you know that I don’t like green onions?”</p>
<p>…Uh, this…</p>
<p>Rannan suddenly realized that Shifu had never specifically told her to exclude onions and garlic when cooking. Although “Playing Classics” had detailed annotations, Shifu would still eat the dishes even when she made them with onions and garlic…</p>
<p>“And, how did you brew the “Detain Heaven’s Immortal”? That’s a fine wine created by Mu Qingge herself.”</p>
<p>Since they left Cuiwei Mountain, Shifu had never brought up this topic. She didn’t expect him to suddenly mention it now, catching her off guard.</p>
<p>Now, she couldn’t really say it was just her guess. After hesitating for a while, she could only uneasily reveal that she had accidentally discovered the hidden compartment in the study.</p>
<p>Su Yishui, with lowered eyes, continued to eat a bun while listening to his young disciple struggle to explain the section on “Fierce Beasts” in “Playing Classics.”</p>
<p>Of course, she couldn’t go into too much detail about the embarrassing incident from long ago, where Shifu had been teased by the female demon, to avoid Shifu getting angry right now.</p>
<p>The specifics would have to wait until Shifu returned to Xishan, and he could read it for himself.</p>
<p>However, Shifu would not let her off easily. With a flat expression, he demanded that she recite word for word, what was written about him. Under his relentless prodding, Rannan had to awkwardly recount everything in detail.</p>
<p>After reciting everything exactly as it was from the book, she was somewhat afraid to look up at her Shifu’s face.</p>
<p>But her Shifu remained silent for a long while, so she tentatively raised her head—only to see Su Yishui’s handsome face devoid of the raging fury she had imagined.</p>
<p>Seeing her finally lift her head, he then said very mildly “When cooking in future, you don’t need to specially exclude onions and garlic. I’m not picky about those anymore. Using sea salt to marinate longan fruit was a method out of necessity to preserve them, because there was no sugar. I don’t like to eat it.”</p>
<p>Rannan was somewhat surprised. Her former Grandmaster’s painstakingly observations, turned out to be all wrong? Come to think of it, her Shifu was the son of a prince, how could he possibly enjoy snacks favored by commoners?</p>
<p>Just then, Second Uncle Master, Yutong, walked in. “Master, Mu Qingge and disciples from Jiuhua Sect have arrived at Wangxiang Pass and are currently being welcomed at the general’s residence by Qin Xuanjiu. Qin Xuanjiu has sent someone to invite you over.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Rannan heaved a sigh of relief. Her entrapping former Grandmaster had finally proved somewhat useful by getting her out of a bind.</p>
<p>Yutong had overheard a little, and seeing Rannan looking crestfallen after her lecture, she comforted her, “You don’t know about your Master’s childhood circumstances, naturally, you have some misunderstandings… Although he was the Prince’s son, he wasn’t acknowledged until he was ten. Before that, his days with the Lady were quite impoverished… My Master once told my brother, that one time, the Lady got some rare longan fruits during an outing and wanted to save them for him. But she was afraid they’d spoil on the way back, so she used sea salt to preserve them. When she brought them back, the Master found the taste peculiar but didn’t say anything to avoid hurting the Lady’s feelings, so he quietly ate them all…”</p>
<p>Rannan’s eyes widened as she listened. She had not expected Shifu’s childhood to be like this. But thinking about it, he was just an illegitimate son of the Prince’s concubine. If the Prince had ignored him before, wouldn’t he have been worse off than children from poor families?</p>
<p>“Then… why did Mu Qingge say that whenever he got angry in the past, eating sea-salted longan fruits would improve his mood?”</p>
<p>Yu Tong shook her head, indicating she didn’t know either.</p>
<p>However, as Rannan thought about it, her heart skipped a beat. She knew Shifu had been forced to join Mu Qingge’s sect. As a teenager at a rebellious age, he had to live with Mu Qingge’s unpredictable temperament, inevitably having to endure humiliation.</p>
<p>So every time Mu Qingge provoked and angered him, feeding him those salted longan fruits that represented bitter days, it was akin to *Goujian, the King of Yue, tasting gall in silence, patiently biding his time.<br/>*<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goujian#:~:text=Goujian%20(Chinese%3A%20%E5%8F%A5%E8%B8%90),the%20son%20of%20Marquis%20Yunchang." rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">勾践 </a><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goujian#:~:text=Goujian%20(Chinese%3A%20%E5%8F%A5%E8%B8%90),the%20son%20of%20Marquis%20Yunchang." rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Goujian was a king</a> who forced himself to taste bitter bile, in order to remember his days of humiliation</em></p>
<p>This kind of endurance and testing of one’s limits… even the most raging anger could be extinguished by that sour and bitter taste, teaching the young man patience and resilience, like a spring ice river about to crack, calm on the surface but turbulent below…</p>
<p>But Mu Qingge had misunderstood, thinking he liked them, so every time he got angry, she would use them to placate him…</p>
<p>Ranran was startled by her own thoughts. At the same time, she felt a sense of inexplicable sadness: perhaps Grandmaster Mu’s behavior at that time was just her being playful, but it made a sensitive and melancholic young man feel deeply humiliated.</p>
<p>This kind of two-way disparity, a master-disciple relationship running counter to each other, was really lamentable……</p>
<p>Thinking about how Shifu would slowly swallow those unpalatable longan fruits in front of Mu Qingge, he was probably thinking about how to dismember her into pieces?</p>
<p>In this way, it could be explained why he would stand by and watch while Mu Qingge was besieged, with her soul scattered in the wind.</p>
<p>Ranran sighed again. The “Fierce Beasts” chapter in “Playing Classics” had been completely wrong. Throughout it all, perhaps only the part about “Retaliation for small offences” was accurate…</p>
<p>Perhaps because he couldn’t let go of the memories of oppression from Mu Qingge, that’s why Shifu was now so cold and distant from her. When Shifu finally arrived at the General’s residence with his disciples who had all eaten their fill of buns, it was already noon.</p>
<p>Wei Fang, who had been accompanying Mu Qingge in her wait, was very fed up! Seeing Su Yishui arriving late, he immediately raised his eyebrows and coldly snorted, “Su Yishui, making us all wait for you, you have quite the arrogance!”</p>
<p>Su Yishui completely ignored him. He looked at Qin Xuanjiu, who was serving Mu Qingge diligently, he went straight to the point and asked, “General Qin, what’s the matter that you wanted to see me about?”</p>
<p>This time, Qin Xuanjiu had finally given a few glances by his esteemed Master. As he explained the process of how he became a disciple, his respected Master seemed to recall some long-forgotten memories, remembering bits and pieces.</p>
<p>However, those past memories were still hazy, and his respected Master couldn’t recall most of it; she mainly relied on what Qin Xuanjiu told her.</p>
<p>Considering there were too many people around his respected master, including even disciples from Jiuhua Sect, Qin Xuanjiu kept his guard up and didn’t mention the Soul Hosting stone that contained the Demon Son’s power.</p>
<p>He would have to wait until there were no others around, to talk to his Master about this hidden secret.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t mention it, the fact that there were demons coveting this place was enough to arouse curiosity. Mu Qingge was instructed by His Majesty Su Yu to investigate the water demon matter.</p>
<p>Initially, she wasn’t very concerned, but when she saw Qin Xuanjiu, who claimed to be her closed-door disciple, and learned that Su Yishui was also present, Mu Qingge finally took things seriously.</p>
<p>However, since even Su Yishui couldn’t detect the mastermind behind the scenes, she was also at a loss, and could only wait for the hidden hand to act again so she could investigate further.</p>
<p>After Qin Xuanjiu helped his respected Master settle in, he passed through the garden and saw Ranran standing at the garden gate, holding a vassal of wine, asking him, “General Qin, I brought back a newly brewed “Detain Heaven’s Immortal” from Cuiwei Mountain. I remember you enjoyed it, so I especially brought you some.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Qin Xuanjiu’s eyes brightened. He praised the Xue girl for her thoughtfulness, took the wine bag and eagerly drank a sip.</p>
<p>However, after that sip, Qin Xuanjiu’s eyes gradually glazed over, his sturdy tower of a body swayed unsteadily, and finally, he fell backward and passed out.</p>
<p>At that moment, Yu Chen rushed out from the corner and promptly caught Qin Xuanjiu, dragging him into the nearby room.</p>
<p>Su Yishui was waiting in the room, very much at ease.</p>
<p>He casually drew a talisman, then flicked his fingers to ignite it, burning it to ashes. He dissolved the ashes into a bowl of clear water and had Yu Chen pour it into the mouth of Qin Xuanjiu, who was lying on the ground. Then he had Yu Chen remove Qin Xuanjiu’s shoes, and drew another rune under his feet.</p>
<p>Ranran watched fearfully from the side, suspecting whether she inadvertently became an accomplice to a major crime and helped her Shifu to murder a high-ranking official of the court.</p>
<p>Just now, Shifu only asked her to serve wine, not to knock out General Qin!</p>
<p>Su Yishui looked at her big eyes rolling nervously and guessed her unease.</p>
<p>After he finished writing the spell under the foot, he told Ranran that he had only cast a “Forgetful curse” on Qin Xuanjiu, and the talisman under his foot was just a protective charm to ward off evil.</p>
<p>Since the Emperor has invited disciples from Jiuhua Sect to Wangxiang Pass, they will surely cause chaos again now that they have gotten mixed up in this. So Su Yishui simply added a “lock” to Qin Xuanjiu’s mouth.</p>
<p>He would temporarily forget about the Soul Hosting stone so that he won’t have to engage with the Jiuhua Sect people. Although this charm only lasts for three days, it should be enough.</p>
<p>After they put Qin Xuanjiu’s shoes back on, Yuchen brought him back to the Moon Gate where he passed out just now. Qin Xuanjiu woke up clutching the wine bag.</p>
<p>He shook his head dazedly and muttered, “Why is this wine so strong…”</p>
<p>But before he could finish speaking, the young girl standing before him snatched away the bag of wine, saying, “Perhaps it wasn’t brewed well. I’ll bring another bag for the General in future.”</p>
<p>The young girl ran away so fast, that Qin Xuanjiu hadn’t reacted yet when she had disappeared from sight.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>
<p>Even though it seems like one of the more quiet chapters, without any exciting fights with demonic vines or rolling pins, but this is one of my favorite chapters.</p>
<p>Shifu and disciple eating steamed buns companionably together, just the two of them, without the others. </p>
<p>Most importantly, Su Yishui finally had the opportunity to ask Ranran, how she knew of the things she knew. </p>
<p>He must have been in so much inner turmoil since she started doing things that only Mu Qingge knew? Ranran had always been similar to Mu Qingge in behavior even though she seemed to be a clean slate, with no past memories. But when she brought out those dried longans he must have been quite shocked. Did he think she was testing him?</p>
<p>Or like General Qin, was he also very sad when Ranran did not remember him at all? <br/>Was restoring the ice lotus pond his way to jog her memories of her past life? He seemed quite disappointed when she told him she didn’t remember anything.<br/>Did he hope she will remember? Did he want her to remember? </p>
<p>I wonder how he feels now that he knows that his dear Master wrote a chapter on him in her ‘Play Book’ <em>haha</em> <br/>This is also the beginning of clearing misunderstandings of two lifetimes and two people getting to know each other properly, again. Or are new misunderstandings being made? <em>hahaha</em></p>

<p>When dinner time arrived, Mu Qingge specially had the royal chef whom the emperor had granted to her, prepare several exquisite dishes and served fine wine to privately entertain her beloved disciple, Qin Xuanjiu.</p>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu had been waiting for such an opportunity to see his Master alone! As they drank together, Mu Qingge tentatively asked him why she had sent him here in the first place. Qin Xuanjiu immediately couldn’t wait to say, “Master, I was just about to explain it to you in detail. Have you forgotten? You sent me here to…”</p>
<p>Mu Qingge handed him a cup of wine, leaned forward slightly, and smiled, “Yes, I sent you here to……”</p>
<p>She patiently prompted him, but the bearded pockmarked man before her was as if he had been struck in his acupoint, staring round-eyed and drawing out his words, “Yes, you sent me here to…”</p>
<p>This back and forth continued for a while, even though Mu Qingge usually had a good temper, Qin Xuanjiu’s antics irritated her, and she couldn’t help but set down her wine cup heavily, saying sharply, “General Qin, are you playing tricks on me?”</p>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu banged his head against the table, then fell to his knees and cried, “Master, how could I dare play tricks on you? I just don’t know if I’ve been drinking too much recently, my memory isn’t very good, I vaguely remember something, but I just can’t recall it…”</p>
<p>When he said this, Mu Qingge had nothing to say in response. After all, everyone has a bad memory. This disciple being as forgetful as his master, no one can be blamed more than the other.</p>
<p>However, Mu Qingge suspected that he was deliberately hiding something, dangling it in front of her without revealing it.</p>
<p>In a fit of anger, the just warmed up relationship between master and disciple suddenly turned cold. Qin Xuanjiu didn’t even get to taste a bite of the royal cuisine before he was unceremoniously sent away.</p>
<p>Feeling frustrated, Qin wanted to go and ask Su Yishui, as he remembered mentioning something to Su, hoping Su could remind him of what it was.</p>
<p>But when he arrived at the small courtyard where Su Yishui and others from Xishan resided, the courtyard was empty, with only a laboriously prepared Five-spice Pig Trotters still simmering on the stove…</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Su Yishui and everyone else, returned to prepare in the courtyard after meeting Mu Qingge during the day.</p>
<p>These past two days, Yu Chen, under Su Yishui’s orders, had brought a lot of dry straw, and then he led the few juniors to make straw men.</p>
<p>After the straw men were made, Su Yishui affixed the Activation talismans Ranran had obtained from Elder Jiu to the chests of the straw men. These straw men, like the ones planting the fields below Cuiwei Mountain, could now act upon commands.</p>
<p>It was already night when everything was ready.</p>
<p>For convenience when subduing demons, Qin Xuanjiu had given them his waist token to leave the city. Su Yishui had Yu Chen drive the carriage, taking a cartload of straw men and their disciples out of the city.</p>
<p>They headed towards the direction of the military platform where Yue’e had previously worked. The ground there had just been compacted, and a new watchtower had been rebuilt. However, it had not been put into use yet, and with the patrols recently concentrated near Wangxiang River, entering and leaving was convenient.</p>
<p>Quietly, Ranran asked her master how they would determine if there was anything suspicious about the military platform. Su Yishui said mildly, “The Spirit Spring can bewitch the heart, knowing the deepest desires within. Wang Yue’e used to come here every day to cook, but gradually started dressing up, not afraid of getting the kitchen ashes on her new clothes. Moreover, she often laughed foolishly towards the direction of Wangxiang River by herself, indicating she had hallucinations, maybe she thought she was flirting with someone like a wealthy young man. The Spirit Spring is sealed and has limited power, only able to influence within a *30 meter radius. Yue’e is probably affected there, so going to the military platform will surely yield some results.”<br/>*丈<em> is 3.33 meter</em></p>
<p>Listening to Shifu’s analysis, Ranran also found it reasonable.</p>
<p>However, she was still puzzled and asked softly, “If what we’re looking for is hidden by Mu Qingge, wouldn’t we gain something by asking her in detail? Why do we need to sneak around at night?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui lowered his head and looked at her. He said, “Didn’t she say she couldn’t remember? But she was seriously affected by that thing in the past, so it’s better if she doesn’t remember.”</p>
<p>He paused for a moment and explained further, “The seal on the Soul Hosting Stone’s demonic nature will gradually increase over time, and eventually, the Soul Hosting Stone will shatter on its own. The abnormality in the compass Qin Xuanjiu carried was because of this. The leaking demonic nature attracted covetous individuals. What we need to do is find it before the Soul Hosting Stone completely shatters. However, its power fluctuates like the tides with the waxing and waning of the moon. I originally planned to wait until the end of the month when its power wanes before acting. But now, people from Jiuhua Sect have also arrived, so we have to take the risk and act in the *middle of the month.”</p>
<p>Ranran whispered, “Will its power also weaken in the middle of the month?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui shook his head, “The Spirit Spring will rise in the middle of the month, it will be at the peak of its powers…”<br/>*<em>Middle of the month is 15th, with full moon which is when the Yin is the strongest</em> </p>
<p>The disciples were immediately dumbfounded, looking at each other in shock. Dealing with a normal village woman who had been mutated by the Spirit Spring was already terrifying enough, and now they had to deal with the main entity. It seemed like an impossible task!</p>
<p>Qiu Xier choked up, almost in tears. Fortunately, their master spoke again, “Don’t worry, it’s been sealed for a long time, with limited abilities and no physical form. As long as you keep your mind steady and don’t get bewitched by it, everything will be fine. What you all need to do is spread out and find the location of the Spirit Spring. Once it’s confirmed, I’ll deal with it alone.”</p>
<p><br/>After he said this, the disciples all let out a collective sigh of relief.</p>
<p>After groping around in the dark for a while, the carriage arrived at the military platform fifty li (25km) away from Wangxiang Pass.<br/>*里 is 500 meters</p>
<p>Su Yishui took out a compass similar to those used by Feng Shui ( geomancy ) masters and distributed them to the disciples, teaching them how to use it before they dispersed.</p>
<p>It was said that the late Emperor of Daqi had once deployed troops and generals here to stabilize the northwest for thousands of miles. So, besides its practical function, this military platform also held a particularly sacred significance. Even when the current emperor was still a Prince, he had personally come here to reward the troops.</p>
<p>Over the years, this place had been regularly maintained. Even though the northwest was covered in yellow sand, the wooden painted surface of this platform still looked new.</p>
<p>This place could accommodate a thousand troops and horses, so it was quite spacious. Besides the platform for reviewing troops, there was also a pavilion for military officers to rest. Nearby was a small kitchen where Yue’e and the other women cooked.</p>
<p>Holding the compass, Ranran unconsciously walked towards the pavilion.</p>
<p>The pavilion was built grandly and exquisitely, in stark contrast to the rough and majestic architectural style of the northwest. It seemed to have been built to highlight the grandeur of the emperor’s personal expedition.</p>
<p>Ranran stared at it fascinatingly and said, tilting her head at the building, “Shifu, the style and carvings of this building are quite similar to the houses on our West Mountain, aren’t they?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui glanced at her coldly, his gaze strangely fierce for some reason.</p>
<p>Ranran suddenly remembered what her second uncle master had said. The houses on West Mountain seemed to have been built by the little prince Su Yu, for Mu Qingge while she was out traveling, at considerable cost.</p>
<p>And this place… It was said that Mu Qingge had also come here with the little prince to inspect troops… Mu Qingge loved indulgence, so could it be that this tall building was also specially built by the little prince for Mu Qingge’s extravagant tastes?</p>
<p>Ranran thought of how her master detested extravagance and waste, so she immediately stopped talking. However, from this perspective, the Emperor really valued talent! With such privileged treatment, it’s no wonder Mu Qingge was willing to help him.</p>
<p>Just then, Su Yishui led her to the right side of the military platform. He closed his eyes suddenly, and at the same time, grabbed Ranran’s slender arm tightly.</p>
<p>Ranran had unintentionally glanced at her master earlier. At the moment before he closed his eyes, there seemed to be a flash of red light in them. So even though her master grabbed her arm firmly, she didn’t dare to struggle, only asking softly, “Shifu… Are you not feeling well?”</p>
<p>After a while, Su Yishui finally opened his eyes, which were as clear as they have always been. He let go of her arm, looked at Ranran’s slightly reddened wrist, frowned slightly, and then asked, “Does it hurt?”</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t want her master to feel guilty, so even though she felt a searing pain on her wrist, she shook her head and smiled, saying it was nothing.</p>
<p>While everyone else was unloading the straw men from the carriage, Su Yishui handed Ranran a talisman made of cinnabar and gold lines.</p>
<p>“If I show any signs of abnormality and the situation goes out of control, you must stick this talisman between my eyes….. No, stick it on yourself.”</p>
<p>Ranran had her mouth half open, not understanding, “Can this talisman ward off evil spirits?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui nodded briefly, saying briefly, “If I’m ever controlled, you all should leave quickly.”</p>
<p>Ranran said in a small voice, “I will never leave Shifu behind… If you’re ever controlled, I’ll find a chance to stick the talisman on you.”</p>
<p>But she still felt worried, “Shifu, if even you could be bewitched, we who have shallow cultivation, won’t we be even more vulnerable? I’m afraid I…”</p>
<p>Before Ranran could finish, Su Yishui interrupted her doubts, “Evil arises from the mind and will magnify the host’s desires infinitely. Pure minds cannot be manipulated. You have a pure mind clear as a mirror, there’s nothing to be afraid of?” For some reason, Su Yishui seemed very certain.</p>
<p>Although praised by her master, Ranran still felt something was off. If she had nothing to fear, wouldn’t her Shifu, who has higher cultivation and lived in seclusion without desires, have even less to fear?</p>
<p>She couldn’t help but feel that her master was very wary of that Soul Hosting Stone.</p>
<p>But her master’s caution made sense. Since the demonic cultivator Wei Jiu was doing everything possible to obtain the Spirit Spring. And Mu Qingge had been targeted just for possessing it, so this Spirit Spring must be very powerful.</p>
<p>Just then, Su Yishui handed her an exquisite short staff with a button in the center. Su Yishui motioned for her to press it, and immediately, the staff extended like Sun Wukong’s Golden Cudgel, becoming longer.</p>
<p>“This staff had been made by an old acquaintance of mine. The shaft is made of ancient green iron. You hold onto it for self-defense.”</p>
<p>Ranran took the staff, about to say something, but her master went straight to the front of the military platform.</p>
<p>The strongest fluctuations in aura is in this spot, so it should be here.</p>
<p>He circled around the military platform a few times and quickly found something amiss.</p>
<p>The military platform was built of stones with large wooden boards on top. However, under the light of their torches and careful observation, one could see that the color of several stones in the west corner of the military platform were slightly different from the surrounding stones, obviously patched later.</p>
<p>Yu Chen took the pickaxe from the carriage and aimed it at those stones, swinging it down. With his natural strength, it didn’t take long before the stones shattered.</p>
<p>When nearly half of it was smashed open, it was indeed hollow inside. When the broken stones fell in, it actually took a long while before a sound could be heard as they hit the ground, indicating how deep the hole was.</p>
<p>As the opening widened, the foul air dissipated, replaced by cold wind, and a whistling sound came through, sending shivers down everyone’s spine.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier was a little scared, but fortunately, Shifu said they did not need to go down below. That dark hole was really frightening.</p>
<p>Su Yishui held a torch and without using the rope ladder tied to the entrance, jumped straight down.</p>
<p>Everyone else sat on the high platform of the military platform, waiting quietly.</p>
<p>Since Su Yishui went in, the howling sound from the hole seemed to lessen. Yu Chen and Yu Tong, the two siblings, squatted at the entrance, nervously waiting for their master’s update.</p>
<p>After about *the time it would take for an incense stick to burn, Yu Chen couldn’t help but stick his head in to ask, “Master, have you landed safely?”<br/><em>*about 30 minutes on average</em></p>
<p>But all that came in response was the sound of whistling wind. Just as Yu Chen was about to shout again, a leisurely voice came from the hole, “I’ve landed, you can come on down!”</p>
<p>Yu Chen asked again, “Master, do you want Yu Tong and me to come down?”</p>
<p>The voice from the hole replied, “Everyone, come down!”</p>
<p>With the master’s command, the rest of them climbed down the rope ladder tied to the wooden stake at the cave entrance.</p>
<p>First was Yu Chen, followed by Gao Cang and Bai Baishan.</p>
<p>After Bai Baishan descended for a while, he shouted downwards, “Master, is it safe down there?”</p>
<p>Soon, Su Yishui’s voice came from the cave, “Hurry up, don’t dawdle!”</p>
<p>Upon hearing the master’s voice, Yu Chen sped up and was the first to land. However, when the other two landed, they were bewildered.</p>
<p>With torches in their hands, they looked around and found an empty cave with no one in sight. Su Yishui, for some reason, was nowhere to be found…</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the surface, Rang Rang was originally sitting near the steps of the high platform with the third senior sister.</p>
<p>The cold night wind from the northwest was very chilling. Ranran, having experience guarding by the river, had bought a small hand warmer in town. She lit charcoal pieces, put them in a round copper box, then wrapped it in a thick cotton bag and tucked it into her arms for warmth.</p>
<p>After all, one must be fully prepared with a Shifu who likes to give surprise tests. She wouldn’t be surprised at all if their Shifu decided to throw them into a graveyard to test their courage one day…</p>
<p>Just as she was lost in her thoughts, the master’s voice suddenly came from the cave, ordering them all to go down. Their Senior Uncle Master had already gone down with the two seniors.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier’s expression fell upon hearing the master’s command. With a slightly tearful voice, she said, “Shifu, I’m feeling unwell. Can I wait here for you guys?”</p>
<p>“No! Come down quickly!” Su Yishui’s voice became stern, and seems very impatient.</p>
<p>Yu Tong hurried over to the two female disciples and said, “The Master wants us to go down. It must be because there aren’t enough people. Let’s hurry and not hold up important matters.”</p>
<p>Since second uncle master said so, Qiu Xier had no choice but to follow along. She could only shuffle slowly to the cave entrance and then said to Ranran, “Stay behind me. Being sandwiched between you and second uncle master will make me feel more at ease.”</p>
<p>Ranran nodded and was the last to descend into the cave.</p>
<p>Because she was holding a small torch, Ranran descended a little slower than the others. By the time she landed, she shone the torch around but saw no one else.</p>
<p>Ranran tentatively called out, “Shifu, Second Uncle Master!”</p>
<p>But after calling several times, there was no response at all. The cave was eerily silent as if no one had ever been there.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Ranran tried to calm herself down. She illuminated the cave with her torch and carefully inspected it.</p>
<p>The walls around the cave were damp, and further ahead was a dark passage with only the sound of dripping water. After thinking for a moment, Ranran turned around and prepared to climb back up the rope ladder. But just then, Su Yishui’s voice came from behind her again.</p>
<p>“Come over here this way.” Obviously, he wanted Ranran to enter the pitch-black passage.</p>
<p>However, this time Ranran didn’t immediately go over. She hesitated for a moment before asking him, “Shifu, why can’t I see you all? Where did Second Uncle Master and the others go?”</p>
<p>At this moment, the voices of Yu Tong and Qiu Xier came from the dark passage, “Hurry up and come over, it’s just you left… Why are you so slow?”</p>
<p>Ranran hesitated and took a step forward, then asked Qiu Xier, “Third Senior Sister, it’s so dark. I’m a little scared…”</p>
<p>Qiu Xier impatiently said, “What’s there to be afraid of? Hurry up and come in!”</p>
<p>Ranran said “Okay” and turned around to grab the rope ladder, ready to climb up with all her strength. When she was heading into the cave earlier, Qiu Xier was so scared that she almost wet herself. Why was she now urging her on as if nothing had happened?</p>
<p>Ranran couldn’t see anyone else and felt something was wrong. Her intuition tells her to climb up first, get Qin Xuanjiu to bring soldiers to rescue them. Otherwise, if she perished in the cave as well, they will be completely wiped out.</p>
<p>But as she climbed the rope ladder, she suddenly felt her body falling straight down, as if an invisible force was pulling her into the dark passage.</p>
<p>In the moment Ranran was being pulled down, she took out the talisman Shifu had given her, and regardless of consequences, turned herself around and struck at what was dragging her from behind.</p>
<p>Her Light Body Technique was now most accomplished and her body was very light. She swiftly turned in mid-air while hitting out with the talisman in one smooth move.</p>
<p>As the talisman struck something, there was a “crack” sound, and sparks actually flew as if something had been repelled by the talisman. With a mournful and eerie scream, accompanied by a gust of foul wind, whatever it was disappeared.</p>
<p>Still shaken, Ranran picked up the talisman that had been blown away by the wind and was about to continue climbing the ladder when her feet were entangled again. This time, the force and speed were even more ferocious, not giving Ranran a chance to react, and she was once again dragged into the dark passage.</p>
<p>Ranran instinctively felt that entering the dark passage would be very dangerous. She quickly dropped the torch, took out the short stick the master had given her, pressed the spring in the middle, and the stick immediately extended at both ends, automatically lengthening. If pressed again, it would even shoot out hooks, which caught onto the entrance of the dark passage.</p>
<p>The pulling force on Ranran paused for a moment, but then it began to increase again.</p>
<p>At this critical moment, Ranran decided to take a risk and try the Demon-Subduing Technique Shifu had taught her.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes, focused her mind and loudly recited the incantation while gripping the stick tightly. Her clear voice echoed repeatedly in the dark passage, gradually emitting a dim golden light. Ranran finally broke free from the pulling force and, at the same time, kicked off the cave wall and barely escaped from the dark passage.</p>
<p>But as she tried to climb up to the cave entrance once more, the cave suddenly collapsed, completely sealing it.</p>
<p>At that moment, a voice came from the dark passage again, but it was the voice of her mother, Qiao Lian, calling out, “Quick, save me! Help! Save me!”</p>
<p>The voice was unmistakably her mother’s. Ranran’s palms sweated, struggling to make a decision.</p>
<p>In the end, she wrapped the golden talisman around the stick, held the spring-loaded stick tightly, and then sat cross-legged on the ground, as if she were meditating back at their Xishan grass hall.</p>
<p>Shifu had said that demons arise from the mind. Since she was convinced that these voices were deceitful, she must not let them disturb her mind. Since she couldn’t escape anyway, meditating was the best way to keep her composure!</p>
<p>Ranran’s current meditation skill and her ability to step on lotus leaves were techniques that have advanced to a higher level. In just a moment, she entered the realm of “Returning to the Void”.</p>
<p>Although her eyes were closed, she was already attuned with the heavens and earth, and every pore on her body could sense the subtle changes in the air.</p>
<p>When a gust of wind attacked, the staff with the talisman attached to it flipped along her wrist and accurately struck back. As the gusts of wind came from all directions, Ranran’s wrist moved quickly, and her staff danced.</p>
<p>This staff, crafted by an unknown expert, had two heads that changed direction with the force. For a moment, it formed a dense web shield around Ranran, giving a sense of impregnability.</p>
<p>Just then, the voice that had been calling Ranran with different voices suddenly changed again, roaring like a furious beast, “Why are you so uncontrollable? I can’t tempt you at all!”</p>
<p>This time, the voice was rough and hoarse, just like the voice Mu Yue’e used before she died.</p>
<p>Ranran remained silent, only gripping the staff with both hands, appearing completely focused.</p>
<p>The voice became increasingly frantic, akin to an enraged man cursing loudly. Strangely, when footsteps splashed through water in the dark passage, the voice abruptly stopped.</p>
<p>Ranran still kept her eyes closed, but when she felt someone approaching, she continued to strike with the staff.</p>
<p>Except this time, her staff was accurately grabbed by someone, and with a skillful move, she was pulled into their embrace.</p>
<p>Ranran let out a low cry and had to open her eyes.</p>
<p>When she looked closely, she saw that the one who had pulled her into their arms was… her Shifu, Su Yishui. However, he seemed to have fallen into water just now, so he appeared drenched from head to toe. Water was trickling down his straight nose, landing on Ranran’s face.</p>
<p>Although her Shifu was wet, still as handsome as ever, but Ranran noticed the redness in his pupils… just like the possessed villager Mu Yue’e.</p>
<p>She tried to break free from his embrace but found herself tightly held by arms with an iron grip, unable to escape. She could only warily ask, “Who… are you?”</p>
<p>But her Shifu remained silent, his gaze… was indescribably frightening. Ranran finally understood what Qiu Xier meant when she said Shifu’s gaze was terrifying. Staring into his eyes, she felt a chilling shiver to her core.</p>
<p>The golden talisman was still wrapped around the staff. Ranran tried her best to move her hands to the back and noiselessly removed the talisman, holding it in her hand in case of need.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Su Yishui lowered his head, getting closer to Ranran’s face, looking as if he wanted to devour her in one bite or do something else.</p>
<p>Ranran did her best to tilt her head away, but her lips accidentally brushed against her Shifu’s cheek… She clearly felt his body stiffen, seemingly uncomfortable by this affront…</p>
<p>So when her Shifu turned to look at her, she said with some tears in her eyes, “Shifu, I didn’t mean to…” But after this accidental kiss, Su Yishui’s grip on her seemed to loosen slightly.</p>
<p>Seizing the opportunity, Ranran suddenly reached out and stuck the golden talisman on her Shifu’s forehead. As the talisman took effect, she could see the redness in her master’s eyes slowly dissipating.</p>

<p>Ranran dared not even take a breath as she tentatively tried to break free from her Shifu’s embrace. However, although the redness in her master’s eyes had faded, he did not release his grip on her, still holding her tightly.</p>
<p>It was only when Ranran looked up at him questioningly that Su Yishui slowly loosened his grip, but their faces remained very close.</p>
<p>Rannian could only tilt her head slightly and tentatively ask, “……Are you…”</p>
<p>Ranran had wanted to ask if he was her Shifu, but it felt strange to ask that to his face. So, she dragged out her words, waiting for his reaction.</p>
<p>Su Yishui also looked at her with a tilted head but just did not speak. It wasn’t until he saw his little disciple frozen, almost unable to even blink her eyes that he casually removed the golden talisman from his forehead and spoke, “I am Su Yishui. The demon on the Soul Hosting Stone can mimic human voices. If you hear any voices, never believe them easily. It only steals the most memorable voices from your memory and mimics them, it does not know who you are.”</p>
<p>His explanation was logical. The voices she had heard before has never called her name.</p>
<p>Ranran remained wary. Who knew if this demonic stone had already gained sentience and form, transforming into her Shifu’s appearance to deceive people!</p>
<p>She decided to test her Shifu and said in a small voice, “You look really handsome…”</p>
<p>Su Yishui always forbidden discussions about his appearance, and disliked people staring at him even more. This test would reveal the truth at once.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, this Su Yishui before her showed no sign of anger, just calmly said, “If you like to look, you can take your time and look all you want later. For now, stay close to me.”</p>
<p>Ranran obediently nodded, but as Su Yishui turned, she dashed off in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Demon! The resemblance is uncanny! Little did it know, her sharp eyes immediately spotted the fault!</p>
<p>This time, its her collar that was grabbed, and in a moment Su Yishui pulled her back into his arms. “Why run? The entrance to the cave has been blocked, and we can’t get out for now.”</p>
<p>Ranran turned her head fearfully. She looked into his eyes and said “You’re not my Shifu…”</p>
<p>Su Yishui remained expressionless for a moment, then immediately understood. She must have recalled the statement from “Playing Classics” about him disliking discussions about his appearance, leading her to conclude he was fake.</p>
<p>So he dryly asked, “Did you bring the dried longan?”</p>
<p>Ranran nodded and took out the snack bag she always carried with her.</p>
<p>It was sewn by her mother, with several small compartments for carrying multiple snacks at once. One of the compartments contained the longan with sea salt that has not been eaten much. She had packed them a while ago, kept for emergencies. But after hearing from her Second uncle master she thought it was  no longer necessary to carry it, but with all the recent unexpected events, she had been too busy to eat snacks and had forgotten to throw it away.</p>
<p>Su Yishui took it and put it into his mouth. He chewed hard and swallowed forcefully, then said coldly, “Can you follow me now?”</p>
<p>Only she, her Shifu, and Mu Qingge knew the complicated story behind this longan. Su Yishui’s sudden action reassured Ranran and she heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>This was indeed her Shifu without a doubt… but where did everyone else go?</p>
<p>According to Su Yishui’s explanation, when he came down, he fell into a spiritual spring cunningly set by the demon stone.</p>
<p>Back then, this demonic force had attached itself to the Netherworld’s Spiritual spring, and it was adept at controlling water. Later, it broke free from the Netherworld but was trapped in the Soul-Hosting Stone for many years.</p>
<p>After a long wait for someone to finally come down, it immediately set a trap eagerly.</p>
<p>Su Yishui had just opened the hidden door of the secret passage, but he was momentarily distracted, slightly influenced by the demonic force, and later encountered Ranran here.</p>
<p>As for the others, they were obviously confused by the disguised voices and lured into the secret passage.</p>
<p>“What does it want with them?” Ranran was worried about Uncle Masters and the others, so she asked Su Yishui.</p>
<p>Su Yishui thought for a moment and said, “The demonic force in the Spiritual spring is bound by the Soul-Hosting Stone, so it can’t leave. It can only entice people who seek to use its power to smash the Soul-hosting Stone so that it can free itself completely.”</p>
<p>Saying this, he picked up a torch and led Ranran into the secret dark passage. The demonic stone seemed to fear Su Yishui very much. When he led Ranran into the secret passage, the enchanting voice that had been alluring her stopped completely.</p>
<p>However, the secret passage became increasingly damp, and in the eventually the water was already ankle-deep. Ranran’s Light Body technique seemed ineffective, her steps becoming heavier and she felt her strength being drained.</p>
<p>At this point, Su Yishui squatted down, indicating for Ranran to get on his back and he will carry her from here. Since the water here had a demonic nature, and Ranran’s cultivation was shallow, being in the water for too long could lead to undesired outcomes.</p>
<p>Listening to Shifu, she could only suppress her slight embarrassment and got onto Shifu’s broad back.</p>
<p>Shifu usually wore long robes and appeared tall and thin, but as Ranran lay on him, reaching out for his neck, her hand accidentally touched his solid chest.</p>
<p>…Shifu looked gentle and elegant but was in fact really muscular… And she had just accidentally kissed his face…</p>
<p>“Hold on tighter, don’t fall down!” Sensing that Ranran wanted to retract her hand, Su Yishui suddenly turned his head and spoke.</p>
<p>His sudden movement nearly made Ranran’s mouth touch his face again. If Su Yishui hadn’t held her steadily, she would have almost fallen backward when she whipped her head back.</p>
<p>And so she had no time to care about blushing and quickly wrapped her arms around Shifu’s neck, stabilizing herself on his back.</p>
<p>Although he was carrying a person, Su Yishui’s steps were as swift as he was flying, seemingly unaffected by the effects of the water.</p>
<p>It’s unknown what happened when he went down earlier, causing him to lose his senses momentarily.</p>
<p>Soon, they reached the end of the secret passage. Upon entering a hidden chamber, Su Yishui waved the torch and quickly saw oil grooves on the walls for lighting.</p>
<p>After lighting them, Ranran couldn’t help but exclaim softly. It turned out that both Uncle Masters, as well as senior brothers and senior sister, were sitting around a huge stone in the center.</p>
<p>The stone was covered in frost, and they were huddled against the ice, using their true qi and body warmth to “hatch” the large stone.</p>
<p>Second Uncle Master, who had a deeper foundation, was relatively better off. Although she was in a trance like the others, her body reacted automatically, circulating true qi to fend off the invading cold.</p>
<p>But Senior Brother and the others had weaker foundations. The cold had invaded their bodies, their lips turned purple and formed icicles. Beneath them, a stream of water flowed like a small creek, flowing into the secret passage.</p>
<p>Obviously, the water Shifu had waded through just now was the ice which melted from the stone. If all the ice on the stone completely melted, the seal on the Soul-Hosting Stone would be completely released.</p>
<p>Su Yishui said in a deep and calm voice, “Set up a protective formation behind me to guard your own mind.”</p>
<p>Ranran immediately began to form hand seals, sitting down on a stone stool to help provide Shifu with some protection.</p>
<p>After Su Yishui finished speaking, he leaped up, and in his hands were several medical silver needles. Using true qi, he shot the needles into the Heavenly Connection Points of the others.</p>
<p>As the silver needles entered their acupoints, Yu Tong was the first to wake. She realized her situation and immediately tried to move backward, only to find that her body seemed firmly stuck to the stone, unable to move.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yu Chen and the others also woke up. Gao Cang shivered from the cold, and starting to cry out. But the worst was Qiu Xier; her body was already frail, and now she couldn’t seem to wake.</p>
<p>The demonic force in the stone was deeply ingrained and Su Yishui also seemed very wary. He couldn’t easily approach, only putting two fingers into his mouth and letting out a long whistle.</p>
<p>Soon, a group of swaying “people” rushed out of the secret passage. It was the strawmen they had painstakingly made over the past few days. It seemed that these strawmen had been digging with tools above, digging open the entrance and then jumping in one by one.</p>
<p>The strawmen walked over, three to five in a group, and started pulling the frozen Yu Chen and the others away from the stone.</p>
<p>Although these strawmen had no flesh and blood, with the help of Elder Jiu’s talismans, they were incredibly strong, easily pulling these people off the ice stone.</p>
<p>However, their palms which had pressed against the ice stone had become bloody, as their frozen skin were torn off as the strawmen pulled them away.</p>
<p>Just at moment they were pulled off, Su Yishui quickly recited an Ice Spell, refreezing the Soul-Hosting Stone that was about to melt, and the water in the secret passage also flowed backward, wrapping the stone in a thick layer of ice once more.</p>
<p>Ranran also got up and helped Qiu Xier, who had been carried back by the strawmen.</p>
<p>“Give her a Clear Heart Pill,” Su Yishui instructed.</p>
<p>Ranran quickly took out the pill she had refined and crushed it, stuffing it into Xier’s mouth. Only then Xier slowly regain consciousnesses, shivering while half-asleep, muttering, “Did I kick the blanket again? Why is it so cold?”</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t have time to answer her senior sister because the Soul-Hosting Stone, which had been resealed, suddenly emitted angry screams and what sounded like many people talking. At one moment, it was Su Yishui’s voice shouting, “Let me out! I will make you all stronger!” and then it changed to Yu Chen’s roar, to Qiu Xier’s crying, making everyone’s ears ache.</p>
<p>Su Yishui remained unfazed, continuing to recite the Ice Spell, leading the water in the secret passage to flow back, gradually thickening the layer of ice.</p>
<p>But just then, the backflowing water seemed to have a consciousness of its own. It struggled hard, breaking free from Su Yishui’s control and converging into a female form.</p>
<p>Gradually, under the illumination of the firelight, the clear surface grew eyebrows and eyes, as well as the color of skin. A woman who seemed to have just finished her bath, dripping with water, appeared in front of everyone.</p>
<p>Ranran widened her eyes in astonishment because she recognized this woman… This beauty…..isn’t it Mu Qingge?</p>
<p>No, she was even more beautiful and charming than Mu Qingge who had just been reborn from the Rebirth Tree. It wasn’t about her physique but the lively spirit in her eyes.</p>
<p>Before, she thought that the Mu Qingge reborn from the tree, should look very similar to her portrait. Now, seeing this beauty, she realized that Mu Qingge after rebirth seemed… to look different from before.</p>
<p>The woman who appeared in front of everyone now, actually bore a striking resemblance to the red-clothed beauty riding a tiger in the Lingxi Palace’s painting.</p>
<p>Her eyes were watery, her clothes half undone, her pearly teeth gently biting her red lips as she softly said, “You have such a cruel heart. Are you going to continue to seal me? Let me out, and I promise you everything…”</p>
<p>Su Yishui looked at the lifelike Mu Qingge in front of him, and his body suddenly stiffened as she approached slowly.</p>
<p>While Ranran was stunned, she remained clear-headed. Seeing “her” approaching, she immediately reminded loudly, “Shifu, be careful!”</p>
<p>However, her worries were unnecessary. Su Yishui had already taken action while she was speaking. Using the torch in his hand as a sword, he thrust it straight towards the woman’s chest.</p>
<p>As the torch pierced through her, the woman stared wide-eyed, looking at Su Yishui with disbelief.</p>
<p>In Su Yishui’s handsome eyes, there was no struggle or reluctance, only an unmistakable disgust…</p>
<p>“How could this be? Your heart… wasn’t it…”</p>
<p>Su Yishui didn’t let “her” continue. He unleashed his spiritual power, causing the condensed spiritual water to collapse, losing its human form.</p>
<p>Seeing that Shifu wasn’t bewitched, Rang Rang breathed a sigh of relief. However she couldn’t help but wonder if Shifu had acted similarly when they besieged Mu Qingge with the three major sects, ruthlessly striking her with a sword through the heart?</p>
<p>She was actually curious about what the creature that could manipulate people’s hearts wanted to say. Because she always felt that Shifu’s feelings towards Mu Qingge were ambiguous.</p>
<p>However, in Cultivation and enlightenment, one must learn to let go and cut off worldly attachments, only then can they attain true enlightenment.</p>
<p>So, Su Yishui could hardly be blamed when he cut down his demonic Master on behalf of the righteous path…</p>
<p>In this critical moment, Ranran couldn’t help but be distracted for a moment. When she snapped out of it, she sighed softly again but then she saw Shifu’s cold eyes staring at her, a gaze akin to being stabbed with ice picks.</p>
<p>Ranran shrank her neck slightly, fearing that Shifu would get addicted to enlightenment and continue to kill disciples in pursuit of it, especially targeting a weakling like her.</p>
<p>After the spiritual water was dispersed, it flowed back onto the ice stone, forming a thick layer of ice again. The temperature in the entire secret chamber also dropped sharply.</p>
<p>After completely sealing the Soul-Hosting Stone again, Su Yishui walked up to the stone, and the others followed him cautiously, carefully observing the demonic stone.</p>
<p>It was obvious that this anomaly of the demonic stone was not caused by their entry into the cave because there were already many cracks on the stone, as if a touch would cause it to split open. That’s why there was spiritual water that kept bubbling out of it.</p>
<p>Now that Su Yishui had frozen the spiritual water again and resealed the Soul-Hosting Stone, once the ice melted, this thing would be uncontrollable again…</p>
<p>With his heart still racing from the scare, Bai Baishan asked Senior brother in a low voice, “When we were being controlled by this creature earlier, what did you see?”</p>
<p>Gao Cang’s eyes welled up with tears. “I saw my deceased mother holding me and humming under the peach tree at home… Whenever I heard her sing before, I would fall asleep quickly, so I couldn’t open my eyes no matter what… What about you?”</p>
<p>Bai Baishan wiped the cold sweat from the back of his neck, feeling lingering fear. “I… saw myself become a great Cultivator, and the three major sects were bowing to me in worship…”</p>
<p>When it came to Qiu Xier, she blushed and remained silent, but her eyes secretly glanced at Shifu. Ranran understood her thoughts and felt that she might have done something disrespectful to their elder in the illusion, so she tactfully didn’t ask.</p>
<p>However, listening to their accounts, this demon truly understood human hearts and could magnify the deepest desires, making people immersed in them, unable to resist.</p>
<p>It was too bad that Shifu was too strong, and the Soul-Hosting Stone couldn’t bewitch him, falling short of success in the end.</p>
<p>At that moment, Ranran suddenly noticed inscriptions on the stone walls of the chamber, and Su Yishui was holding a torch and examining them.</p>
<p>Her fellow disciples were trying to meditate and recover their strength. So Ranran walked over to look at the inscriptions.</p>
<p>Those inscriptions were probably also written by Mu Qingge, and they were as free-spirited as the person, with graceful unrestrained strokes.</p>
<p>“My good disciple, Shui’er, when you see these words it is like seeing me, by the time you read this letter, you should have let go of your grievances against me. If you can do this, that will be good. I believe you can also control the Spiritual Spring and send it back to the Netherworld. This thing has been tainted by the mortal world for too long, learning too much of human greed and vices. I fear that if this continues, its demonic nature will become stronger… Behind the waterfall in the western mountain valley, there is a cave with excellent temperatures throughout the seasons. Inside, there is a hidden jar of “Detain Heaven’s Immortal” wine. I’m afraid I won’t have the chance to drink it. By the time you find it, it should have already matured. Even though Elder Jiu has a technique to let ten years pass in a day, can true fine wine be rushed in a day? Only with the passage of time can one truly enjoy the essence of youth. Once matters here are settled, if you can taste this wine on my behalf, it would not have been in vain for it to age for so many years…”</p>
<p>According to Qin Xuanjiu’s account, Mu Qingge had hidden the Spiritual spring here not long before she was besieged in Jue Mountain and had her soul scattered.</p>
<p>So, these words were probably Mu Qingge’s final wish from her past life.</p>
<p>Aside from entrusting the important task of returning the Spiritual spring, what Mu Qingge had on her mind and could not let go of, was unexpectedly a jar of fine wine hidden in the cave behind the back mountain. How could such a carefree person plot to release a demon lord and plunge the Three Realms into chaos?</p>
<p>At this moment, she stole a glance at Shifu beside her and couldn’t help but be shocked. Because Shifu, who was usually cold and indifferent, now had an expression as if a river of ice had cracked, his eyes filled with indescribable desolation and resentment…</p>
<p>He suddenly used spiritual energy and wiped away the inscriptions on the wall. He then slowly turned to look at Ranran, staring at her with eyes that seemed ready to tear her apart in the next moment.</p>
<p>Ranran thought that Su Yishui did not like that she peeked and saw Mu Qingge’s message, so she quickly tried to step back discreetly. However, Su Yishui grabbed her wrist and didn’t let her go.</p>
<p>“To what extent can a person be so simple and so heartless? Knowingly heading to certain death, yet what they hold in their heart…. is just a jar of wine?” He suddenly asked Ranran.</p>
<p>Ranran stole a glance at the Soul-Hosting Stone. Seeing no abnormality, she verified that Shifu wasn’t possessed by the demon, so she could only answer the question seriously, “Um… although “Detain Heaven’s Immortal” becomes more fragrant with age, it’s indeed best after around twenty years. Shifu, when you go back, don’t forget to drink it. I’ll make scallion beef and salted peanuts as side dishes for the wine, alright?”</p>
<p>The lingering taste of “Detain Heaven’s Immortal” was very strong, with both sweet and spicy notes, which complements tender beef and peanuts perfectly!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, his disciple’s sincere answer only intensified the anger in Su Yishui’s eyes, and he gripped her wrist even harder.</p>
<p>Ranran suddenly realized that she had obviously fallen into the glutton’s mindset and couldn’t get out of it. She quickly cleared her throat and tentatively said, “I see that Grandmaster Mu cares about you, Shifu. *You are the first one she thought to offer her fine wine….. Of course, it’s not quite right for Shifu to risk your life to escort the Spiritual spring. If it’s too dangerous, Shifu, you shouldn’t go… Your disciple can’t bear to see you in danger…”<br/>*先紧着你 <em>giving you priority</em></p>
<p>The girl’s clear and gentle voice finally calmed down the few veins that had popped up on Su Yishui’s head.</p>
<p>He looked at Ranran with a gloomy expression until Qiu Xier finished meditating and stood up, calling out to Ranran. Only then did Su Yishui take a deep breath, slowly releasing her hand.</p>
<p>Ranran quickly stepped back a few steps, slipped over to where her fellow disciples were meditating, and left Shifu staring listlessly at the wall.</p>
<p>The others also finished restoring their breath and regained their strength, ready to leave the cave. However, the scene just now was too shocking, so everyone inevitably bombarded Su Yishui with questions about what had just happened.</p>
<p>Su Yishui explained simply that because this stone sealed a demonic spirit. Spiritual power had leaked for some time, it tempted a weak-willed villager and made her draw a curse on her own neck, then used her transformed into a water demon to harm soldiers, all to lure Qin Xuanjiu.</p>
<p>Ranran understood upon hearing this. After all, there were guards at the military platform, not something a villager like Yue’e could handle alone. If Qin Xuanjiu had been controlled, he could have made the soldiers open the secret passage to release the Spiritual spring.</p>
<p>It was too bad, Qin Xuanjiu’s life lot was too good, that he encountered the cold spell which froze the river, narrowly escaping this disaster. As for the calls to impeach him, it could only be said that General Qin didn’t know how to get along with others, and probably offended someone in the official circles.</p>
<p>Right now the Soul-Hosting Stone couldn’t bear the burden any longer, so the Spiritual spring must be transferred into the specially-made Spiritual Jade Talisman Bottle from Elder Jiu. However, the demonic nature of the Spiritual spring was strong. Although it had been sealed for a long time and its power had diminished considerably, thinking about the situation just now, it still seemed extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>“You guys go up first.” Su Yishui instructed them.</p>
<p>So the two uncle masters led them up first. But Ranran didn’t move from her spot. “Shifu, let me stay with you!” Ranran said, raising the golden talisman in her hand.</p>
<p>If Shifu was beguiled again, she could stick the talisman on his forehead.</p>
<p>But for some reason, Su Yishui was certain that it would not be necessary, that nothing would happen to him. Perhaps when he decisively dispelled Mu Qingge’s illusion just now, it also dispelled his inner demons?</p>
<p>So Ranran had no choice but to go up the rope ladder. She went to the medicine box in the carriage to get medicine powder and white cloth, and treated the bloody palms of the others.</p>
<p>Su Yishui also came up sooner than expected.</p>
<p>Ranran noticed that the talisman bottle given by Elder Jiu was tied with a golden rope, hanging around Shifu’s neck. It was originally made of white jade, but now it was as red as blood, as if something had been injected into it.</p>
<p>It seemed that Su Yishui glanced at her and then stuffed the talisman bottle into his collar, putting it out of sight.</p>
<p>Shifu must have resealed the Spiritual spring in the talisman bottle. Since the Netherworld Spiritual spring was so important, there seemed to be nothing safer than carrying it on oneself.</p>
<p>However, only Su Yishui and Ranran knew the secret of the talisman bottle. When they went up Cuiwei Mountain, only the two of them met Elder Jiu.</p>
<p>So except for the two uncle masters, the other disciples only knew they found something sinister that confuses the mind, not knowing that the stone in the cave held the Netherworld spiritual spring that was coveted by all in the cultivation world. They definitely did not know that Su Yishui had already transferred the spring into the jade bottle around his neck.</p>
<p>Ranran always knew when to speak and when to keep quiet. Since Shifu did not want to let the other disciples know, he must have his reasons. However, how to bury the big hole they dug became a problem.</p>
<p>The other senior brothers didn’t get up to Cuiwei Mountain, nor did they know why Qin Xuanjiu had been guarding this place for many years. Naturally, they didn’t know the secret of the Netherworld’s spiritual spring. Thinking that there was a demonic object here, and that the sinister stone was still in the cave. So Bai Baishan, feeling uneasy, asked Shifu, “The entrance is wide open like this. If someone breaks in there, what should we do?”</p>

<p><em>I don’t care what others say! The Spiritual Spring is a blessing!</em></p>
<p>I wonder why was Su Yishui affected differently? <br/>The others went to warm up that stone, but he was wandering around, looking for Ranran?</p>

<p>Upon hearing second senior brother’s question, Su Yishui leisurely replied, “Someone will take care of it.”</p>
<p>As he said this, the straw men that had just come out of the cave took out bags of sand from the carriage, along with tools like a trowel, and started meticulously patching the hole in the wall with rocks.</p>
<p>The straw men, driven by spirit talismans, all seemed very skillful, and it seemed they could finish repairing the large hole before dawn.</p>
<p>Now, everyone finally relaxed and hurried back to the city in the carriage to catch up on sleep.</p>
<p>Because of the commotion caused by the killings in Wangxiang River, the military had been on edge, and no one had used the military station these days, so when the mud and sand used to fill the hole dried, no one noticed.</p>
<p>The next day, in the night, Su Yishui also pasted the accelerating wine-brewing charm from Elder Jiu on the newly patched mud and sand. The newly patched area immediately dried and aged, leaving no trace of having been dug open.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As for Qin Xuanjiu, these days he had been accompanying his Master Mu Qingge. They had almost traveled all over Wangxiang Pass, but they had not seen any anomalies.</p>
<p>Lin Yeting said to Mu Qingge, “Master, Qin Xuanjiu offended the son of a general who came here for training before, which is why the incident with the water demon caused such a stir. Someone above wanted to deal with him, and they found a ready-made excuse. It might even just be someone creating a scare with a deformed person. Why bother staying here? His Majesty has been hoping for your early return to the capital.”</p>
<p>While Mu Qingge was on the way here, she had seen the corpse of the water demon. Due to much time had passed since death, it had mostly returned to its original human appearance, although wrapped in lime. However, the strong fishy smell was overwhelming, and Mu Qingge was unable to discern anything.</p>
<p>After hearing Lin Yeting’s words and thinking about Su Yishui’s cold attitude towards her, Mu Qingge smiled coldly.</p>
<p>After instructing Lin Yeting to leave, she couldn’t help but look in the mirror. The woman in the mirror had bright eyes and white teeth, stunningly beautiful.</p>
<p>This must be the face that Su Yu couldn’t forget right? He possesses vast lands and power, yet he could not embrace a beautiful woman. It truly is a regret one could not let go of…</p>
<p>However, as Mu Qingge looked at herself, she suddenly smashed the tea cup in her hand against the copper mirror—still not like her! Although there was a fifty percent resemblance in appearance, she just couldn’t replicate “her” carefree and disdainful attitude towards the world!</p>
<p>Could it be because of this that Su Yishui continued to ignore her?</p>
<p>Thinking about this, the beautiful face in the copper mirror suddenly revealed a trace of uncertainty. She slowly extended her hand, revealing a blood-red line on her white arm, like a winding snake, curling up her arm—this was the evil created by Wei Jiu! He actually came up with a way to use grudge water to nourish the Rebirth Tree!</p>
<p>As a result, after absorbing enough grudge water, her spiritual power became abundant upon arrival. However, the consequence of this expedited method was that after using spiritual power each time, she felt a discontinuity in her true qi flow, and the red line on her arm was clearly a sinister object.</p>
<p>This should be the evil thing that Wei Jiu had planned to use to control Mu Qingge’s life force when she was reborn, which is why he easily agreed to making a Soul oath with Su Yishui.</p>
<p>Because this grudge water had been used before the Soul oath was made, even if she died because of it, Wei Jiu wouldn’t be considered in violation of the oath.</p>
<p>Initially, this red line was not very noticeable, but in these past few days, it had grown wildly.</p>

<p>Mu Qingge dared not disclose her weaknesses to the crafty Elder Kaiyuan of Jiuhua Sect. She could only wait for Wei Jiu to come and threaten her, then see how to deal with him.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Mu Qingge became frustrated again, unable to stop herself from wondering how “she” would handle such a situation if it happened to her?</p>
<p>Probably be as carefree as always, drinking wine under the moon, singing freely with friends? What in this world could make “her” feel the torment of sorrow that cannot be resolved?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, she gritted her teeth, took a deep breath, and slowly lowered her sleeve.</p>
<p>But what was so great about being carefree? Now, she was the unforgettable Mu Qingge in front of everyone.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Just then, Qin Xuanjiu suddenly came to call on her.</p>
<p>It turned out that when Qin Xuanjiu was washing up tonight, he suddenly remembered what Master had instructed him before, so he quickly explained everything to Mu Qingge.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge’s *pupils slightly contracted when she heard about the Netherworld Spirit Spring. This was extremely crucial information, but Qin Xuanjiu claimed that he had just remembered it. This kind of talk seemed suspicious, like he was trying to fool her.<br/>*<em>pupils dilates in response to increased cognitive activity, such as increased levels of arousal or mental effort</em> <em>( apparently Chinese novel writers like to use this phrase lol )</em></p>
<p>However, the urgent matter was to take possession of the Netherworld Spirit Spring. As long as she had the power of the Spirit Spring, resolving the grudge water in her body should be easy, right?</p>
<p>Now the Elder Kaiyuan of Jiuhua Sect was only using her as a stepping stone, so that he could have easier access to the Emperor. Although he appeared polite on the surface, he was still wary of her.</p>
<p>Because although the spiritual power taken by the another spirit fruit was not much, it still had a great impact on her. If she followed the rules to cultivate and advance, it would probably take twenty or thirty years to recover it back.</p>
<p>In recent days, Mu Qingge had also been inquiring about the whereabouts of the spirit fruit that fell prematurely sixteen years ago. However, even Wei Jiu did not get any answers, she naturally gained nothing either.</p>
<p>These past days, Mu Qingge had been restless, always worried that something unexpected might happen.</p>
<p>If she could benefit from the Netherworld Spirit Spring, it would be a completely different situation. Even if “she” were still around, there would be nothing to fear.</p>
<p>Thinking of the power that the spring holds, Mu Qingge was very tempted. Even though she knew the Spiritual spring’s demonic nature was great and mishandling it could easily backfire, she could overlook it.</p>
<p>But still she had to keep this matter hidden from the people of Jiuhua Sect. Thinking of this, Mu Qingge’s gaze turned to Qin Xuanjiu who was following her…</p>
<p>He was the garrison guarding this place, so if he could assist her, everything would be easy. Indeed, when she prompted him, Qin Xuanjiu readily agreed without hesitation.</p>
<p>In Qin Xuanjiu’s view, this thing was entrusted by Master, so if she were to take it away now, it is as it should be.</p>
<p>However, Qin Xuanjiu really didn’t know where it was. Master had only told him to diligently watch the compass but hadn’t informed him of the location of the object.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge asked again, “Has Su Yishui left the city these days?”</p>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu suddenly remembered that after being driven away by Master Mu Qingge, he couldn’t find Su Yishui and his disciples, so he called the city guards. After inquiring, he found out that they had left the city three nights ago.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, Mu Qingge went to visit Su Yishui.</p>
<p>When she pushed open the gate, she saw pieces of mushrooms scattered all over the floor being dried, as well as other mountain products.</p>
<p>The girl named Xue Ranran, with an apron tied around her waist, came to open the door, and upon seeing Mu Qingge, immediately turned and called for Shifu.</p>
<p>However, Mu Qingge stared at Ranran.</p>
<p>This young girl was quite delicate and lovely. But without the aura of youthfulness, she would just be an ordinary-looking woman.</p>
<p>But Mu Qingge found that every time she saw her, she seemed to have become more beautiful each time. It wasn’t a change in her facial features, but rather… an inexplicable charm that made people involuntarily stare at her.</p>
<p>Being stared at so intently by Elder Mu, Ranran blushed and touched her cheek, asking, “Elder, is there something dirty on my face?”</p>
<p>Mu Qingge came back to her senses and smiled slightly, “No, I just feel like I’ve seen you somewhere before, but for a moment, I can’t remember who you resemble…”</p>
<p>Ranran nodded, “I look a bit common, so naturally I tend to be similar to many people.”</p>
<p>Mu Qingge was about to say something when she saw that Su Yishui was already standing behind Xue Ranran.</p>
<p>“May I ask why you’re here?” Su Yishui asked.</p>

<p>Mu Qingge looked at Su Yishui’s face and slowly said, “I have some private matters to discuss with you. Could you accompany me for a walk by the Wangxiang river?” As if she was afraid that Su Yishui would rebuff her again, she urgently added “It’s about the Spiritual Spring and not our personal affairs.”</p>
<p>Without any change in his expression, Su Yishui thought for a moment and then turned to Ranran, saying, “If the food is ready, you all can eat first. No need to wait for me.”</p>
<p>Ranran, who always respected her master, quickly said, “I’ll save you some food. The steamed egg with cured meat won’t be ready for a while, I’ll also save it for you.”</p>
<p>Su Yishui nodded, and Ranran hurried to fetch a cloak for her master and helped him put it on—since it was windy and cold by the Wangxiang river, even though her master was already a half-immortal, it wouldn’t hurt to wear something warm.</p>
<p>Moreover, her Shifu is tall and sturdy. Wearing this cloak with fox fur trim, he exudes an ethereal charm and looks ridiculously handsome. Ranran felt that since her master was going out for a walk with Mu Shizun, they might renew their relationship, talk about fine wines behind waterfalls, so she should dress him up a bit.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Mu Qingge watched this master and disciple, and could not help feeling a lingering discomfort in her heart.</p>
<p>The pair before her looked similar in age. With the man tall and handsome, and the woman petite and gentle, they definitely don’t look like master and disciple? They seemed more like newlyweds and the wife was seeing her husband off…</p>
<p>This Xue Ranran was still young and didn’t seem to have much worldly experience. It was reasonable for her to be infatuated with her handsome master… But Mu Qingge knew Su Yishui too well. He was someone with very high standards, admired by many women, but in the end, *it was only wishful thinking on their part.<br/>*落花有意流水无情 <em>literally means the flowers that fall into the stream have intent, but the moving water heartlessly washes them away</em></p>
<p>But for now, finding the Spirit Spring’s whereabouts was the most important.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Once they left the courtyard, Mu Qingge silently followed Su Yishui. As both of them have a strong foundation they moved swiftly. In no time, they arrived by the Wangxiang river with its constantly flowing waters.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge asked tentatively, “You should know that I hid the Soul Hosting Stone containing the sealed Spirit Spring here before, right?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui didn’t answer but said mildly, “Since you were the one to hide it, how would I know?”</p>
<p>He didn’t answer directly, deflecting the question, like a slippery fish in the water difficult to grasp.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge decided to be straightforward, “Qin Xuanjiu has told me. He also said you have been searching for it already. Since you arrived here first, you should know more about it. After I reincarnated from the tree, I have forgotten many things, so I hope you can help me find the Spirit Spring to prevent another tragedy.”</p>
<p>At this, Su Yishui lifted his eyes. He looked at Mu Qingge and said with a mocking tone “Don’t you have the current emperor backing you? And the disciples of Jiuhua Sect are at your beck and call. Why bother me, a person in seclusion to be mixed up in this? Besides, what does your affairs have to do with me?”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Mu Qingge couldn’t help but smile knowingly, “Are you upset? Actually, Su Yu and I are just working together. Although he is an Emperor in the mortal world, in the eyes of us cultivators, he’s just a flesh and blood body. How can he compare to you in my heart?”</p>
<p>Saying this, Mu Qingge couldn’t help but look down at the water’s surface, where the reflection of a beautiful and charming woman’s face could be seen… In the previous life, this face, so similar to hers, captivated many men, who were willing to go through fire and water for her.</p>
<p>How this face had been enviable and made many women jealous! And this was what Su Yishui liked…</p>
<p>“There’s no one else here, so you don’t need to pretend to be indifferent. Others may not know, but I know that you have feelings for me… It’s just that at that time, I had too many admirers and inadvertently ignored you, hurting you…”</p>
<p>As she spoke, she took a few steps forward, almost falling straight into his arms. She raised her head slightly, tears in her eyes as she said, “Only in times of adversity can you see the true hearts of people. When my soul was shattered, only you were willing to give up everything and exchange it for my reincarnation. Even if I can’t become an immortal, I will never disappoint you again…”</p>
<p>After speaking, she leaned forward as if to offer a kiss, but was suddenly pushed away by Su Yishui with great force.</p>
<p>He used so much strength that Mu Qingge almost fell into the Wangxiang river.</p>
<p>Su Yishui took two steps back, looking at the river calmly, and said flatly, “I think you’ve misunderstood something. As you say it was the past life. Since you were fortunate enough to be reborn, you should cherish it. After all, there were people who hoped for your well-being, even willing to sacrifice their lives to redeem your sins.”</p>
<p>Su Yishui’s words were not false. Back when Mu Qingge’s soul had scattered, those disciples who cried their hearts out were grieving like they were losing their own parents. Some even cut their flesh and blood on the spot just to give Mu Qingge a chance at rebirth.</p>
<p>And Su Yishui sacrificed most of his cultivation just to save her wandering soul which had not yet dissipated. It was precisely because of this sacrifice that she was certain that he had Mu Qingge in his heart.</p>
<p>But now, it seems that Su Yishui intended to clear all debts. From now on, their ties are severed and they would have no further entanglement.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge was caught off guard. She felt quite embarrassed when he shoved her away.</p>

<p>She looked at him in some disbelief, a cold expression on his face. She took a deep breath and suddenly changed to a light tone, “If that’s what you think, then it’s fine too. But… you already know the whereabouts of the Spirit Spring, don’t you?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui and his disciples had gone out of the city at night before, heading outside the city, and returned at dawn.</p>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu was sure he had never told anyone this secret, and Su Yishui had only asked about it before.</p>
<p>Given Su Yishui’s intelligence, after getting some clues from that boorish man, it was not impossible for him to figure out where the Spirit Spring was hidden.</p>
<p>Moreover, Qin Xuanjiu also said that it was the Mu Qingge from the past life, who repeatedly instructed him to seek out Su Yishui.</p>
<p>With this, Mu Qingge softened her tone and said, “Yishui, you already know how dangerous the Spirit Spring’s backlash is. It shouldn’t have appeared in the human realm in the first place, and you were also harmed by it before. Even I am not completely sure I can control it, so why don’t you hand it over to me to handle? Otherwise, if the righteous path finds out you’ve secretly hidden the Spirit Spring, you should know best what happened to me before.”</p>
<p>Although her words seemed caring, upon closer examination, they carried a hint of threat. It was as if she was saying, “If you don’t help me obtain the Spirit Spring, I will reveal it.”</p>
<p>When Su Yishui heard this, he suddenly smiled and turned towards her.</p>
<p>The man who usually had a cold expression, once he smiled, he exudes a charm that was hard to resist, like an ice river melting, elegant and delicate.</p>
<p>As far as she could remember, she had never seen Su Yishui smile at her like this, so she couldn’t help but feel a bit dazed.</p>
<p>At that moment, Su Yishui leaned over and whispered in her ear in a low voice, “The red line on your arm should be wrapping around your shoulder soon, right? If you delay a few more days, you’ll turn into a walking corpse, at the mercy of Wei Jiu’s torment.”</p>
<p>Mu Qingge’s originally rosy face turned extremely pale in an instant, staring at Su Yishui in shock and suspicion. “How… how do you know?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui still had a smile on his face, but his eyes carried a chilling coldness that made one shiver from the core. “You think that hanging on the Rebirth Tree for twenty years would allow you to enjoy the blessings left by your past life without worries? The Grudge Water is the most Yin substance in the world, fermenting in the abyss for thousands of years. Even Wei Jiu doesn’t fully understand this thing. If I were you, I wouldn’t be thinking about Spirit springs or rivers. It is completely useless to you and will only intensify the toxicity inside you, becoming increasingly uncontrollable. You’d better think about how to prolong your life and protect yourself.”</p>
<p>Mu Qingge gritted her teeth, took a deep breath, and said softly, “Yishui, you wouldn’t be able to bear watching me fall into Wei Jiu’s hands, right? In the past, even if I just smiled at other men, you would sulk for days without talking to me…”</p>
<p>Su Yishui’s expression grew even colder, but his tone softened as he looked at the rushing river water. “I will prepare some pills to suppress the Grudge Water for you. But Wei Jiu will probably come looking for you soon. If you can get the key to the Netherworld from him, I will have a way to solve the Grudge water problem for you.”</p>
<p>He had given the key to Wei Jiu before, but he didn’t know if Wei Jiu had destroyed it out of anger after he found out he was tricked. If it was still intact, returning the Spirit Spring to its original home would be simpler.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge stared at him wide-eyed. “How can I ask him for that? Why would he give it to me?”</p>

<p>Su Yishui half-closed his eyes, his words seeming to imply something else. “You’ve always been capable. If you want something, you can get it by any means necessary. It’s a matter of life and death for you, and I believe you’ll find a way. I shall await for good news.”</p>
<p>With that, he no longer bothered with her response. He turned around, and prepared to go back for dinner. His little disciple’s steamed egg dish was very tender, if delayed too long, it wouldn’t taste the same.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge watched him leave with eyes full of hate, digging her nails into her palm until it bled. Just a moment ago, she couldn’t even be sure if Su Yishui was talking to Mu Qingge or to…</p>
<p>That damned Wei Jiu actually did such a vile thing to the Rebirth Tree, causing her to be poisoned by the Grudge water even before she was reborn. In hindsight, the other Spirit Fruit had fallen earlier and avoided the Grudge water. If “she” were still alive, it would have been a blessing in disguise after all…</p>
<p>For a moment, countless thoughts swirled in her mind. Eventually, she took a deep breath and calmed herself down.</p>
<p>Since Su Yishui was willing to suppress the poison for her and delay its effects, it was now easier to handle. Others might not know, but she knew very well that the men who were once charmed by Mu Qingge’s beauty wasn’t just Su Yishui alone.</p>
<p>Even Wei Jiu, that demonic cultivator, was probably acting out due to unrequited love, right?</p>
<p>With so many powerful and capable men around her, how many people would long for that? With just a bit of charm, she could manipulate them as she pleased. Unfortunately, someone didn’t know how to use it. Instead of using her charms, she only liked to roam mountains and rivers in their spare time, drinking with some old, decrepit old men…</p>
<p>But this life was different. She was the one with the captivating appearance that could mesmerize anyone. With a little tactics, the situation could change immediately.</p>
<p>Su Yishui didn’t know his own weight. Despite halving his cultivation, he still wanted to claim the Spirit Spring for himself? Mu Qingge didn’t know that Su Yishui had plotted against Wei Jiu, acquiring part of his golden core. She sneered, turned and also left.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When she returned to her residence, Wei Fang was instructing someone to unload a pill furnace from the carriage. Seeing her return, he greeted her respectfully, “My Master wrote a letter and borrowed a Purple Fire Pill Furnace from the Leader of the Flying Cloud Sect. Its firepower is slightly inferior to your previous pill furnace but still usable. Since we’re not far from the Flying Cloud Sect, I had someone transport the furnace here first. Do you want to start refining now, considering the urgency on His Majesty’s side…”</p>
<p>Mu Qingge lowered her eyes and looked at the pill furnace, nodding in satisfaction, then ordered, “Place it in the hall for now. This place is full of danger; we’ll discuss it later after we go back.”</p>
<p>But after everyone dispersed, Mu Qingge’s expression completely fell. After the failed attempt to ask for the furnace from XiShan, she had tried using other furnaces back home several times, but they all ended in failure.</p>
<p>What the Emperor wanted wasn’t just common fundamental pills like a Cleansing Pill. Cultivators all know that pills could be divided into gold and silver tiers. Silver Pills are easy to refine, but Gold Pills often required extremely high aptitude and mentality.</p>
<p>Only those with a heart untouched by worldly desires could concentrate fully and refine Gold Pills.</p>
<p>Her heart, tainted by two lifetimes of worldly affairs, was obviously not calm enough. Even if she got the Nine Revolutions Profound Iron Furnace, it would probably still be difficult to refine pills.</p>
<p>This made her feel rather anxious. After all, everyone knew that the demonic cultivator Mu Qingge had extraordinary talent in alchemy. Earlier she had used the excuse that her furnace was not suitable, but now that Elder Kaiyuan, that old fox, had borrowed the precious Purple Fire Pill Furnace, she could no longer find an excuse anymore.</p>
<p>Thinking about how she had encountered one obstacle after another since falling from the tree, she couldn’t help feeling enraged. All of these could be blamed on Su Yishui!</p>
<p>Su Yishui… he’s just a cold block of ice that can’t be warmed! She shouldn’t have given in to her feelings and fallen for this man with a heart of stone!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As for Ranran, she thought that her master and Mu Qingge were catching up, and it might take a very long time. She was afraid the steamed egg dish would get tough if left for too long. After some thought she decided to eat it first. </p>
<p>Later, she would steam another bowl, which would be perfect for Shifu when he returns. But unexpectedly, as soon as she took two bites, Shifu came back. When he entered the kitchen he saw his disciple sitting on a small stool eating her master’s share. </p>
<p>His expression slightly darkened, and he took the bowl and spoon from Ran Ran’s hand.</p>
<p>Ranran gulped down the piece of cured meat in her mouth and hurriedly exclaimed, “Shifu! Please let me explain!”</p>
<p>Su Yishui didn’t even bother to change the spoon and directly used Ranran’s, tranquilly eating what’s left of the steamed egg.</p>
<p>Ranran thought that her Shifu must be starving after exposure to the cold winds by the river, so she quickly scooped some rice for him onto the small table and brought out the reserved half of the dried Tangerine Peel Duck to go with it.</p>
<p>“Shifu, why did you come back so soon? I was thinking you might be going to the restaurant in the nearby town with Elder Mu for a meal!”</p>
<p>Su Yishui took a few bites of the duck, then looked up at her and asked, “Why would I eat with her?”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>
<p>Not Ranran who has not fallen for her Shifu yet ( or realize she has fallen? ), sending him out on his ‘date’ with his ‘ex’, looking all fine…</p>
<p>Not ‘Mu Qingge’ thinking those two behaving like a newly wed couple.<em> lol</em></p>

<p>Ranran would not dare to mention that she had guessed Su Yishui’s relationship dilemma with his former master, Elder Mu. Going to a restaurant, of course meant two people having a private conversation by themselves.</p>
<p>She couldn’t expose him, to save her Shifu’s dignity, so she could only force a dry smile.</p>
<p>Su Yishui ate gracefully but quickly, finishing a bowl of rice in a few bites. After putting down his chopsticks, he said, “The matters here are settled. We will pack up this afternoon and prepare to leave.”</p>
<p>Everyone smiled upon hearing this; they had long wanted to leave this horrible place!</p>
<p>If another demon were to appear, they wouldn’t be able to handle it with their current abilities.</p>
<p>However, they had gained something from this trip. When they were stuck in the underground passage at the Military Platform, their flesh was frozen from being attached to the Soul Hosting Stone for so long. However, during their recovery, they discovered that their spiritual power had become more refined.</p>
<p>Even chubby Qiu Xier could now jump lightly and get onto the carriage.</p>
<p>They only knew they were following their Shifu to find the demon responsible for Yue-e’s demonization, and they weren’t quite sure what was inside that big stone underground, but they vaguely guessed it was related to their improved foundations.</p>
<p>However, their Shifu said that everything bestowed by evil beings must be returned. These days, not only were they forbidden from using spiritual power, but they also had to calm their minds, dispel those spiritual energy, and write the Calming Heart Mantra fifty times a day.</p>
<p>According to their master, that thing is extremely malevolent. If one’s will was not firm enough, they could easily be tempted and fall into demonic cultivation. So, writing the Calming Heart Mantra for a month would help them keep their minds under control.</p>
<p>However, Su Yishui didn’t seem in a hurry to return to the Western Mountain to drink the aged wine of Mu Qingge’s. Seeing his disciples had been frozen so terribly and their misery from having to relinquish the recent advancement they received, he suggested they go soak in a hot spring to dispel the cold.</p>
<p>As for where they were going, it was called Cha Ming Mountain, located in the mild climate of Jiangnan. Without sword riding, it would take quite some time to travel there.</p>
<p>On the way, they would seize every opportunity to write their Shifu’s assignments on horseback or in the carriage.</p>
<p>Bai Baishan, being agile-minded, after he finished his homework, he came to sound Ranran out, “You were with Shifu when you went to Cuiwei Mountain. You should know the origin of that water demon spell. Also, when we were in the cave, you were the one who came with Shifu to rescue us. Did Shifu tell you what was inside that stone?”</p>
<p>Ranran shook her head, changing the subject, “Second senior brother, you only wrote this forty times, you still have ten left! Be careful not to get caught by Shifu; he might double your punishment.”</p>
<p>Actually, Shifu does not check their assignments; it was all based on their own sense of responsibility. Bai Baishan intentionally wrote larger characters on more paper, making his stack look thicker.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, his attempt to appear diligent was seen through by Ranran at a glance, and Bai Baishan quickly put a finger to his lips, whispering, “Shh.”</p>
<p>“Little Miss, please don’t tell Shifu, look at my wrist, it’s almost swollen. If you tell Shifu, and he punishes me again, my hand might be gone…”</p>
<p>Bai Baishan was afraid Ranran would expose him, so he put in all his effort to persuade his little sister.</p>
<p>Ranran chuckled at his nervousness, “You better finish the remaining ten, and I won’t tell Shifu.”</p>
<p>Bai Baishan glared at her, “You’re so unreasonable; now you’re not definitely not on our side. No wonder Shifu always favors you!”</p>
<p>Since coming out of the cave at the Military Platform, Bai Baishan’s spiritual powers was raised the most. This powerful feeling of lightness and agility was intoxicating.</p>
<p>If one day his martial arts could be as profound as Shifu’s, what a scene it would be! Unfortunately, these few days, Master had specially instructed them to dispel the energies gained from the cave, so Bai Baishan did not dare to use his skills.</p>
<p>It felt like having a fortune in hand but having to return it after just touching it; it was really frustrating!</p>
<p>So, he couldn’t help but jab his little junior sister with his words, to relieve his frustration.</p>
<p>Ranran ignored Second senior brother’s sarcastic remarks. As Shifu said, he led them to the door, but cultivation was up to the individual. If second senior brother wanted to slack off, he would always find a way.</p>
<p>As the younger disciple, she could only urge him on. Shifu from Western Mountain had always let his disciples manage themselves after teaching them skills.</p>
<p>However, Ranran herself had finished her assignments flawlessly. Qiu Xier now looks to Ranran for everything; seeing her meticulousness, she also finished her tasks diligently.</p>
<p>As for Senior Brother Gao Cang, he always took Shifu’s words as law and so he too wrote his assignments meticulously.</p>
<p>Bai Baishan, being set apart by their behavior, thus reluctantly completed a few more pages.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>However, this journey wasn’t all gloom. They had thought it would be a leisure trip, but it nearly cost them their lives. When they arrived at Cha Ming Mountain and experienced the prosperity of Jiangnan, they truly relaxed and enjoyed studying and playing.</p>
<p>Although the winter in Jiangnan was cold, it was much better than the desolation and chill of the northwest. Ranran finally could take off her thick cotton clothes and wear light dresses.</p>
<p>She had grown a lot taller in the past year, but she was still slender, so she couldn’t buy clothes that was too loose. Those that fit her waist were often too short. So, when buying dresses, she often had to extend the hemline to reach her shoes.</p>
<p>When she saw Ranran in a floral dress paired with a white undershirt, Xier clapped and said she looked good, but she also commented that Ranran’s choice of colors was too plain, not bright enough.</p>
<p>Ranran is now somewhat influenced by Shifu, feeling that the brightly colored clothes she used to wear were indeed a bit hard on the eyes. Wearing these softer colors made her feel much calmer as well.</p>
<p>However, Qiu Xier didn’t agree. In her opinion, young girls should wear bright vibrant colors, otherwise they will be letting down their youth!</p>
<p>Because it was Shifu’s money, she chose a bright lotus root color for her long skirt, which looked like a full blooming bellflower from afar.</p>
<p>While the two girls were chattering and choosing clothes, Senior Brother went to the shoemaker to add leather soles to his cloth shoes, making them more durable and easier to walk in.</p>
<p>As for Second senior brother, who originally followed them to pick clothes but found it boring, he decided to take a walk outside. However, as soon as he stepped out, he felt drops of water on his face, even seeping into his eyes…</p>
<p>He looked up in bemusement at the eaves, where the water seemed to be dripping from. Then he hurried into a nearby bookstore to buy books.</p>
<p>After Ranran and third senior sister finished buying clothes, they went to look for second senior brother. When they turned the corner, they saw second senior brother carrying a bamboo book frame, smiling and nodding at a nearby alley.</p>
<p>Because of the angle, Ranran couldn’t see into the alley and didn’t know who second senior brother was talking to.</p>
<p>So, Ran Ran walked straight over, and just as he turned around, they almost bumped into each other.</p>
<p>“Younger junior sister, why are you so clumsy? Rushing over like this, what if you bump into someone!” Bai Baishan came to his senses and immediately patted his chest.</p>
<p>Ranran looked past him, and behind him was a dead end, no one in sight…</p>
<p>Unable to figure out what happened, Ranran asked, “Second senior brother, who were you talking to just now?”</p>
<p>Bai Baishan impatiently said, “Just someone asking for directions, they were right…”</p>
<p>As he turned to point, he realized there was no one behind him and was left stunned.</p>
<p>Just then, Qiu Xier ran over shouting, “Come on, there’s a monkey show over there. Senior Brother saved us a bench, so we can sit and watch!”</p>
<p>So, the two of them hurried over. Young people always love to have fun, and in that empty alley, water droplets seemed to continue dripping…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After watching the monkey show, they reunited with Second Uncle Master and went up to Cha Ming Mountain. Shifu had gone up the mountain ahead of them, to visit an old friend.</p>
<p>Originally, they thought Shifu would just take them to soak in some spring in the wild mountains. But they never could have guessed, that Cha Ming Mountain had a beautifully built tea house and hot spring pools.</p>
<p>Perhaps seeing their struggles and hardships at Wangxiang Pass, Shifu was so considerate to bring them to this villa where only wealthy people could enjoy tea and hot springs.</p>
<p>The owner of the hot spring pool on the mountain was over forty, of medium build. According to Second Uncle Master, he was also once a disciple of Mu Qingge.</p>
<p>This owner’s surname was Zeng, full name Zeng Yi. After Mu Qingge’s soul scattered, the righteous sects disbanded the disciples of Lingxi Palace, and he was driven away from Xishan and ended up here, managing the hot spring pools.</p>
<p>When Ranran saw this scholarly middle-aged man, she could still vaguely see the charisma of a once-handsome youth between his wrinkled brows.</p>
<p>When this Uncle Zeng saw Su Yishui, he didn’t treat him coldly like Qin Xuanjiu, but warmly welcomed him. Instead of arranging them in guest rooms, he had them stay in what seemed to be his own backyard.</p>
<p>When he saw the two female disciples Xue Ranran and Qiu Xier, Zeng Yi looked back and forth at the two girls, then settled his gaze on Su Yishui, as if asking something.</p>
<p>Su Yishui didn’t answer but made an excuse to dismiss the three younger ones after they greeted this Uncle Zeng, leaving only Ranran. Then he said to her, “This is your Fourteenth Uncle Master. You should thank him because the stick you use was made by him.”</p>
<p>Zeng Yi stared at Ranran, silent for a long while. It wasn’t until Ranran obediently held up a tea cup to serve him that he seemed to snap out of it, quickly took the cup, and somewhat excitedly said, “You… don’t be so polite. What do you like to eat? I’ll have the kitchen make it for you right away!”</p>
<p>Ranran felt that this Fourteenth Uncle Master was indeed a kindly elder, but she didn’t want to be presumptuous and casually order food, so she just smiled shyly.</p>
<p>But when she looked up again, she saw tears welling up in the eyes of this scholarly uncle. He quickly wiped his eyes with his sleeve, forcing back his emotions, “The wind is a bit strong today, making my eyes water… You sit down quickly, I’ll bring some fruits for you to eat.”</p>
<p>Ranran looked out at the warm and sunny weather outside the window and didn’t know when the wind started blowing in the hall, causing Fourteenth Uncle Master’s eyes to water.</p>
<p>However, when he lifted his hand to wipe his tears, Ranran was shocked again. Because from his oversized sleeves, only his palm was visible, and not a single finger!</p>
<p>After Uncle Master left, Ranran served tea to her Shifu in the hall.</p>
<p>While boiling water and warming cups, she curiously asked, “Shifu, what’s the story with Uncle Master Zeng’s hand?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui glanced at her and slowly recounted the story of  Uncle Master Zeng.</p>
<p>It was said that Uncle Master Zeng was once a master craftsman of weapons. The weapons he made were very highly sought after. However, because his father offended the powerful, bringing calamity to the family, they sent him to XiShan for refuge.</p>
<p>At that time, Mu Qingge thought the fair and refined Zeng Yi was an interesting and talented person, so she generously took him in, even providing him with ancient weapon-making texts to study.</p>
<p>Although Zeng Yi didn’t practice foundational cultivation or fast, the weapons he made were extraordinary. But later, after the death of Mu Qingge, he was captured by some influential villains who forced him to make weapons.</p>
<p>But he refused to do so, even when they threatened him with death. They ended up cutting off his fingers one by one. Fortunately, Su Yishui arrived in time and saved him.</p>
<p>*Only guilty of being talented, losing his fingers made him unable to make weapons anymore, but also stopped the rest of the world from being interested in his skills. He was able to maintain a peaceful life by managing the hot spring pools here.<br/>*匹夫无罪怀璧其罪  比喻有才能、有理想而受害 <br/><em>Someone who suffered because they are talented or has ideals</em></p>
<p>Ranran felt deeply grieved and whispered, “So the spring-loaded mechanism stick was made by Master Uncle Zeng before he was harmed? Such skillful craftsmanship, but now he can’t make anything anymore, isn’t that a pity?”</p>
<p>Upon hearing Ranran’s whisper, Su Yishui chuckled lightly and said, “Take a look at the inscription on the stick.”</p>
<p>Ranran looked down and saw that there were two “Ran” characters in the shape of flowers on the inscription!</p>
<p>If it was a finished product from Master Uncle’s earlier days, how would he have known that the person using this stick in the future would be named Ranran?</p>
<p>Soon Ranran had her answer. When she accompanied Shifu to the backyard house to find Master Uncle, she happened to see him making something in a workshop.</p>
<p>However, he wasn’t using his hands but had removed his shoes and socks, placed his legs on the table, and deftly assembled various polished components with his ten slender toes…</p>
<p>The workshop was also filled with exquisite clocks, cosmetic cases, and similar items, all of which were presumably made by Master Uncle.</p>
<p>When Zeng Yi saw Ranran and Su Yishui, he quickly put down his work, put on his shoes, and stood up to greet them.</p>
<p>Seeing Ran Ran curiously examining a cosmetic case, he smiled and used his fingerless palm to open it. Surprisingly, a pleasant melody of strings and bamboo came from inside, and lifelike little jade figurines holding earrings and rings stood up and walked out of the box one by one, as if dancing gracefully to the music.</p>
<p>“This is my new creation. If you like it, you can have it to play with.” He pushed the cosmetic case towards Ranran.</p>
<p>Although Ranran was unable to recognize its worth, she guessed that such exquisite work must be very valuable. How could she accept it? She quickly waved her hand and declined.</p>
<p>But Su Yishui mildly said, “Your Uncle Master is offering it sincerely. Don’t refuse, accept it.”</p>
<p>With Shifu’s words, Ranran accepted it. She curiously opened and closed the lid repeatedly, her big eyes sparkling as she pondered the mechanisms inside the box.</p>
<p>Su Yishui then talked about their adventures at Wangxiang Pass and also thanked him again on behalf of his disciple for the excellent weapon he had provided.</p>
<p>Zeng Yi asked seriously, “Is it handy? When I corresponded with Yishui before, I roughly asked for your height, and I made that stick according to the height measurement in the letter. But now that I see you, it seems you’ve grown a lot taller. It seems I need to make some adjustments to the stick so that it fits your hand better.”</p>
<p>Ranran had entered XiShan for nearly a year now and had indeed grown taller. She thought about how her stick was specially made by Fourteenth Uncle Master for her, and she couldn’t help feeling touched.</p>
<p>He had created so many exquisite things using his feet instead of hands, which made her admire him even more.</p>
<p>Genius, even in adversity, can still change the world. Of course, it requires rock-solid determination to achieve that.</p>
<p>However, with so many senior brothers and sisters, why was she the only one who received Uncle Master’s love and received such a sophisticated weapon?</p>
<p>When Ranran brought it up, Master Uncle Zeng was momentarily dumbfounded. He then said, “I made something for everyone, but I haven’t had the chance to pass them to your Shifu yet…”</p>
<p>Ranran felt relieved after hearing this and nodded. However, as if remembering something, she earnestly said to Fourteenth Uncle Master, “Please rest assured, Uncle. I will never tell anyone where this stick came from. But Uncle, you shouldn’t make these anymore in the future. In my opinion, making cosmetic cases and clocks is already good enough.”</p>
<p>After all, Uncle had lost all ten fingers. If it was known that he regained his divine skills and attracted the covetousness of unscrupulous people again, wouldn’t it lead to a repeat of nightmares?</p>
<p>Upon hearing Ranran’s words which are mature beyond her years, Zeng Yi sat up straight and respectfully said, “Over the years, I have not made any more weapons… I just can’t stay idle, so I make some small items to pass the time. But *you’re right, I will learn to be more discreet in the future and not show off…”<br/>*您 <em>is a formal polite way to say ‘you’ but reserved for elder, seniors</em></p>
<p>Ranran noticed that Uncle Master was using a formal tone and sat up straight as well, saying, “Uncle Master, are you angry? Are you mocking your disciple niece for being too talkative and ignorant?”</p>
<p>Zeng Yi looked melancholy, but after a discreet glance from Su Yishui, he forced a smile and said, “You’re right. I just thought of how Master scolded me several times before for being too arrogant and not knowing how to show restraint. She often said that if she were still around, she would naturally protect us disciples, but if she wasn’t,  we would all be vulnerable. Unfortunately, I was young and arrogant at that time, and I didn’t listen to her. I was only focused on creating more impressive divine weapons to dazzle the world. I didn’t expect that in the end, her words would all come true. I have learned my lesson, but I never expected the price to be so high… She must be… extremely disappointed in me!”</p>
<p>This was the second disciple of Mu Qingge that Ranran had met, besides Shifu.</p>
<p>People often said Mu Qingge was greedy and lecherous, superficial and likes to judge people by appearance. But Ranran felt that Mu Qingge’s disciples were all excellent people.</p>
<p>Based on what Uncle Master Zeng said, Mu Qingge would educate her disciples with such seriousness and care, indicating that although she didn’t manage to train any outstanding immortals, at least her disciples were kind-hearted and straightforward enough to be considered gentlemen.</p>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu could abandon his prospects and stayed in the extreme cold of the northwest for twenty years just because of his Master’s instructions. Zeng Yi would rather lose all ten fingers than help tyrants cause suffering to the innocent.</p>
<p>As for Shifu Su Yishui, his character is even more impeccable. He had been practicing medicine on Western Mountain for several years, although his medical fees were expensive, and he was a bit lazy, only treating a few patients each year. But his reputation for saving lives and benefiting the world was absolutely authentic!</p>
<p>In this way, although Mu Qingge had a bad reputation and ended her life somewhat ingloriously, with such disciples who lived uprightly, they were much better than those seemingly noble but actually corrupt orthodox sects.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, she comforted, “If Master Mu knew about your situation, she would definitely be proud of you!”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this from Ranran, Uncle Master Zeng put away his sadness and exclaimed with joy, “Really?”</p>
<p>Ranran nodded vigorously, finally coaxing Uncle Master Zeng to smile through his tears.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>However, when night fell and she soaked in the hot spring pool with Qiu Xier, she saw the new weapon Qiu Xier had obtained—a common ring knife. Although the handle had exquisite patterns and the blade was delicate, it was nowhere near as stunning and extraordinary as Ranran’s mechanism staff.</p>
<p>Uncle Master Zeng probably made cosmetic cases often, understanding women’s preferences very well. Just the two exquisite magnolia bell ornaments hanging on the knife handle made third senior sister very satisfied. She leaned against the pool edge soaking in the hot spring while playing with the knife, commenting that the color and pattern of the handle matched dresses very nicely…</p>
<p>As for the eldest senior brother and the second senior brother, they received double swords and a longsword. Apart from the exquisite craftsmanship of the handles, there was nothing particularly remarkable about them.</p>
<p>It seemed that Uncle Master had run out of inspiration and did not put much effort into making things for the other three disciples.</p>
<p>However, the other three disciples didn’t know about Uncle Master’s past, let alone that Ranran’s weapon was also a gift from Uncle Master Zeng, so after thanking Uncle Master Zeng for his generous gifts, everyone was quite harmonious.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran felt that Uncle Master Zeng showed great respect for Mu Qingge. But he didn’t treat Su Yishui with the same coldness as Elder Jiu or Qin Xuanjiu, which was very puzzling.</p>
<p>However, it was normal for relationships among disciples to be varied, some good and some not so good. Perhaps Uncle Master Zeng had a good relationship with Shifu in the past, which led to such a long-lasting friendship.</p>
<p>But recently, Ranran hadn’t been getting along well with the second senior brother. He seemed burdened with something heavy and often disappeared during this time of healing in the hot spring pool.</p>
<p>When he returned, he would be humming a tune and appear quite pleased with himself.</p>
<p>Since this place was near a bustling town, Ranran secretly speculated with Qiu Xier that the second senior brother must have gone down the mountain alone to have fun.</p>
<p>They didn’t know what fun things he was doing that made him go down the mountain so often without telling them.</p>
<p>Ranran nodded indignantly. Shifu always let his disciples roam freely and didn’t pay much attention to their studies. Since coming here, he often stayed with Uncle Master Zeng in the backyard workshop for a long time without appearing, so he was even more lax in managing the disciples.</p>
<p>And the two Uncle Masters were also out on missions. The second senior brother now seemed like an unleashed dog, always running outside.</p>
<p>After breakfast that day, Bai Baishan used stomach pain as an excuse and left the three disciples who were meditating and cultivating Qi, returning alone to rest.</p>
<p>Once he left, Qiu Xier quickly got up and said to Ranran and Gao cang, “Let’s secretly follow the second senior brother and see if he’s gone down the mountain to have fun.”</p>
<p>Gao Cang straightforwardly said, “Isn’t this improper? What if Shifu comes to check our progress?”</p>

<p>Qiu Xier disagreed, “When has Shifu ever come to check our progress? We’ll go and return quickly, naturally he won’t find out.”</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t mind either; she was also in her playful years, and Shifu had never said they couldn’t go down the mountain. The second senior brother should have gone to the town nearby, which was very close. If they went to shop, it would be perfect to buy gifts for her parents.</p>
<p>After all, this was her first time going on a long trip away from home since birth. The last time she went shopping, she saw a piece of fabric suitable for her mother, but unfortunately, there was only about a meter left, which was not enough to make a skirt.<br/>*一匹布<em> is about 3.3 meters</em></p>
<p>The shopkeeper told her that new stock would arrive in a few days, so it was just nice to go have a look. Going on a trip and returning empty-handed to West Mountain would be quite embarrassing.</p>
<p>Thinking about this, they tidied up, each took their weapons, wore veiled hats, and went down the mountain together.</p>
<p>This manner of young heroes felt very cool and unrestrained; the three juniors were now skilled and agile, flying and leaping down the mountain with great joy.</p>
<p>Because the tea and hot springs here were famous, the visitors were mostly wealthy families, so the town was bustling.</p>
<p>When they were near the town entrance, they had seen the figure of the second senior brother from afar. They had originally planned to secretly follow him, but unfortunately, the second senior brother hurriedly walked and disappeared after turning into a long street.</p>
<p>Since they couldn’t find him, they decided to simply shop and buy things. Besides buying gifts for their parents, Ranran also planned to buy a gift for Uncle Master Zeng. After all, she should express her gratitude after accepting his exquisite mechanism stick.</p>
<p>Ranran planned to buy Uncle Master a pair of thick-soled shoes and soft white cotton fabric. She would personally make him a few pairs of comfortable and breathable socks and embroider *Pine tree motifs.<br/>*劲松 不畏风寒而挺立的松树。比喻刚强不屈的人。<br/><em>Sturdy pine tree, used to describe resolute and unyielding people.</em></p>
<p>Uncle Master’s feet were as important as a craftsman’s hands and naturally needed meticulous care. While selecting breathable white cotton fabric, Ranran inadvertently looked up and saw the second senior brother in front of a courtyard, smiling foolishly, and then walked straight into the courtyard.</p>

<p>Ranran wanted to call Gao cang and Qiu Xier but didn’t know which stall they were at. So she simply put down the cotton fabric and walked towards the courtyard, wanting to see what the second senior brother was up to.</p>
<p>There was a tall tree next to the courtyard. Ranran lightly jumped up to it, and she could see the situation inside the courtyard.</p>

<p>She saw the second senior brother standing in the courtyard, smiling indulgently at a burly man, saying, “Rou’er, it’s only been a day, why do you miss me so much? Come on, wipe away your tears…”</p>
<p>As he spoke, the second senior brother took out a handkerchief from his pocket, hugged the burly man’s thick waist, and wiped his tear-streaked face. Finally, he planted a big kiss on the man’s dark and hairy face…</p>
<p>Ranran’s cultivation was not enough, and she was so shocked that she almost fell from the tree!</p>
<p>Second senior brother, so you’re like this! Your tastes are really too heavy!</p>
<p>Thinking that she unintentionally witnessed the second senior brother’s illicit affair, Ranran felt very sorry as well.</p>

<p>But soon, she realized something was wrong. The burly man whom Bai Baishan kissed looked very angry, gritting his teeth and showing a completely different expression from the teary-eyed appearance the second senior brother was talking about, as if he could tear the second senior brother apart at any moment.</p>
<p>However, his words were flat and dry, like reciting lines from a play, “Bai Lang, without you by my side, I can’t even sleep well. I’ve already prepared the bathwater for you. Do you want to take a bath first?”</p>
<p>Hearing this, the second senior brother raised an eyebrow, smoothly lifted the man’s chin, and said in a flirtatious tone, “Are you so impatient because I didn’t give you enough yesterday? Don’t worry, after I take a bath, I’ll make sure to give you a good time…”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Ranran tried to stop herself from puking. She bit her finger, and felt unsure if she should continue eavesdropping. Although she felt that the second senior brother also had the freedom to love a man, seeing him being affectionate with a hairy brute made her feel extremely embarrassed and had goosebumps all over.</p>
<p><br/>But at this moment, she noticed that the burly man named “Rou’er” had led the second senior brother to a tub filled with crimson bloodwater.</p>
<p>The second senior brother seemed oblivious to the unusual tub and began undressing, chatting merrily with “Rou’er” while entering the tub. In an instant, the blood-red water in the tub eagerly rushed into the second senior brother’s body, and he suddenly rolled his eyes and fell unconscious in the tub.</p>
<p>Ranran was horrified. Just when she was about to go rescue the second senior brother, a woman walked out of the house and said to the burly man, “He has absorbed the blood of a horned demon and can’t wake up for a while! Go, drip more *’One Leaf Veils the Eyes’ into his eyes again, so he won’t notice anything wrong after he wakes up.”<br/>*一叶障目</p>
<p>The burly man roughly lifted the second senior brother’s eyelids and dripped some medicine into his eyes, but it was unclear what the medicine was for.</p>
<p>Just then, the burly man named “Rou’er” couldn’t hold himself back anymore. He said to the woman, “Elder Tu, can’t you find a woman to do this kind of seduction work? This kid keeps touching me like a horny dog every time, I really want to cut him alive!”</p>
<p>The beautiful woman glared at him fiercely and said, “I’m the only woman in Crimson Gate, if you won’t do it, do you want me to deal with this idiot?!”</p>
<p>With that, the burly man quickly knelt down, bowing repeatedly and profusely declared that he doesn’t dare.</p>

<p>Tu Jiuyuan softened her tone and said, “He’s under the influence of the drug, so a few suggestive words can create illusions in his eyes and sounds in his ears. In his eyes now, you are the stunning beauty that only appears in his dreams, and he thinks he has had passionate moments with you several times. This is an excellent opportunity that must be utilized well. Su Yi Shui is on Tea Fragrance Mountain. This kid’s body has already absorbed the blood of a horned demon, so any pool he soaks in will have the poison of the horned demon, subtly poisoning without detection. Once Su Yi Shui is poisoned, his internal energy will be disrupted, which will help Master regain his core cultivation. If this plan succeeds, you will be the top contributor… Besides, you are not a delicate girl, what harm is there in letting this kid take a little advantage of you?”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, “Rou’er” immediately saluted with clasped fist and declared loudly, “For the sake of the Master, I am willing to do anything!”</p>
<p>If it were an ordinary day, Ranran would have had the leisure to sigh at the hardships of being a disciple of the demonic sect. Even a proud and upright man of seven feet had to play the role of a woman to seduce others.</p>
<p>But now, her second senior brother was the victim, and from what she heard, they were planning something against theirShifu, Su Yi Shui! But what exactly were they planning to do?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Just then, after the female demonic leader finished her instructions, she turned and left the courtyard, walking towards another street.</p>
<p>Ranran looked at the second senior brother sleeping unconscious in the tub and was certain that since he was being manipulated by them, but he should be temporarily safe. So she agilely leaped from the rooftops, following that Tu Jiuyuan.</p>
<p>She walked swiftly to a lavishly decorated teahouse and walked in directly.</p>
<p>Some tea customers also wanted to enter, but they were stopped by two burly men at the door, who said that the teahouse had been booked and asked them to find another place.</p>
<p>Ranran knew that there must be some secrets in this teahouse, but she couldn’t enter at the moment.</p>
<p>So Ranran looked around and suddenly saw a tall Poplar tree on the street.</p>
<p>She walked over, circled behind the tree, took advantage of the distraction around her, lightly stepped on the tip of her toes, and leaped onto the tall tree. Then she jumped to a nearby rooftop, then another, moving like stepping on lotus leaves in a pond, quickly reaching the rooftop of the teahouse.</p>
<p>She found a shady corner of the roof, sat cross-legged, closed her eyes, and focused her mind. In no time, she entered a meditative state, able to ignore the noise from the street and listen clearly to the voices inside the teahouse.</p>
<p>A sharp male voice said, “Wei Jiu, His Majesty’s intention is simple. With a useless key, we can obtain the whereabouts of the Spirit Spring. Isn’t this a win-win situation?”</p>
<p>At this point, Ranran heard a familiar piercing laughter, “Mu Qingge has been reborn again, why has she become so timid? If she wants something from me, she should come and ask for it herself. Why involve an emperor to intimidate people? Does she think I, Wei Jiu, am a eunuch in the palace, peeing my pants at a mere threat and complying at once?!”</p>
<p>His words were sarcastic and pointed, and the seemingly eunuch-like man, upon hearing Wei Jiu’s biting words, smiled awkwardly, “How could Chief Wei possibly be like us servants? Your cultivation is profound, your followers are numerous, you are the number one person among the demon cultivators! His Majesty has never cared about immortal cultivation affairs, but now he needs Master Mu to refine pills for him. However, Master Mu has some misunderstandings with you. His Majesty is willing to mediate, and if we can turn hostility into friendship, wouldn’t it be a win-win situation? His Majesty is willing to give a reward on behalf of Master Mu, would these ten thousand taels of gold satisfy you?”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu smiled and said, “Mu Qingge said she knows the whereabouts of the Netherworld Spring, I believe her! But it’s not good for her to avoid me and seek help from other men. Tell her, the Marrow-Cleansing Pool Meet is coming up, and this time, my disciples from Crimson Gate will also participate. At that time, I will prepare a banquet for her and also check if the Grievance water poison she’s suffering from is serious. Of course, if she can’t bear it any longer, Crimson Gate will always welcome her. But if she continues to get other men to negotiate with me, even if it’s the emperor, I’ll treat him like a fart!”</p>
<p>To mock the emperor in front of a high-ranking eunuch like this, this demon has to the the only one in the entire world.</p>
<p>The old eunuch took a deep breath, seemingly finding it difficult to continue in his anger. But he probably knew Wei Jiu’s murderous temperament, so he just chuckled twice and said, “Back then, you secretly assisted His Majesty and he has always remembered it. If this matter fails, it won’t diminish His Majesty’s love and respect for you.”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu laughed coldly, “If he truly appreciated it, why has he only made temples for Mu Qingge to be worshiped? I don’t see him build a golden statue for me? These tricks of maintaining balance and giving benefits, let him save them for his officials.”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When the eunuch left, Tu Jiuyuan came over and quietly mentioned Su Yi Shui’s disciple has returned to meet “Rou’er” again in the small courtyard. At the end, Tu Jiuyuan said, “The Chief is wise. When we found Su Yi Shui’s disciples in town, you came up with this wonderful plan. That Bai Baishan is indeed a gullible fool.”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu smiled sincerely this time, “When I saw Su Yi Shui’s disciples in the town, I immediately took notice of this person with shallow roots and a wandering gaze… But it’s also strange, there’s actually a hint of demonic aura on him. If it weren’t for the lingering yin energy on him which has not dissipated, ‘One Leaf Veils the Eyes’ wouldn’t be so effective. This hidden piece must be used well.”</p>
<p>After saying this, the teahouse fell silent, only the sound of tea lids hitting tea cups and people sipping tea could be heard.</p>
<p>At this moment, Tu Jiuyuan hesitated again and said, “Chief, you’ve lost most of your cultivation, it’s time to retreat and recuperate. Why bother asking Mu Qingge to come personally? If there’s anything, I, your subordinate can convey it on your behalf…”</p>
<p>Ranran heard this, and Wei Jiu’s voice suddenly turned cold, and he slowly spoke, “Jiuyuan, do I need to consult with you before I do things?”</p>
<p>The woman called Jiuyuan seems to have knelt down with a thud, “Chief is wise and possesses great foresight. Whatever you do must have profound intentions. I spoke too much, I deserve punishment!”</p>
<p>After a series of slaps and punches to the face, there was a pause, then Wei Jiu spoke again, “Alright, get up. I know your private thoughts. You didn’t want me to see Mu Qingge, but don’t worry, I already said no one can replace you…”</p>
<p>Ranran, who was sitting on the rooftop, slowly opened her eyes at this point, allowing the bustling noises of the street to fill her ears again. At first, she wasn’t sure of the woman’s identity. During the birth of the Jue Mountain Spirit Fruit, there was chaos on Jue Mountain, and she hadn’t paid attention to the disciples of the Crimson Gate. But she never expected that the person this woman came to see secretly… turned out to be the demonic cultivator Wei Jiu!</p>
<p>Although she didn’t see him, Wei Jiu’s unique voice was unmistakable.</p>
<p>When did her second senior brother fall victim to the schemes of the demonic sect? Thinking that they wanted to use her second senior brother to harm their Shifu, Ranran couldn’t help but feel anxious.</p>
<p>So she stood up, intending to go back and report to her Shifu first.</p>
<p>Just as Ranran stood up, a string of bells fell from her pocket – these bells were bought by her third senior sister just now, with each of them having a string.</p>
<p>As Ranran bent down to pick it up, the tiles under her feet suddenly cracked, and a long whip wrapped around her ankle like a spirit snake, pulling her down directly.</p>
<p>In the instant she was pulled down, her body naturally reacted. With a quick flip, she broke free from the whip’s entanglement, steadying herself skillfully and landing lightly on the ground.</p>
<p>And at this moment, she also saw a man still sitting in a high chair, sipping tea.</p>
<p>It was indeed Wei Jiu. Unlike the ethereal aura of her Shifu, this man’s features are rather sinister in its beauty.</p>
<p>However, unlike his domineering attitude on Jue Mountain, the Wei Jiu who lost almost half of his core appeared much gloomier. Although he smiled when looking at her, there was a strong killing intent in his eyes.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder that when he had tried to ask Mu Qingge to become his Master but wasn’t accepted into the West Mountain Sect. This man might be beautiful, but he also gave off a chilly discomfort.</p>
<p>But now wasn’t the time to critique a great demon. When she fell down, many Crimson Gate disciples with swords and knives appeared out of nowhere, surrounding her. They were just waiting for Wei Jiu’s command to chop her into pieces.</p>
<p>Ranran did not expect to fall into such a dangerous situation in a mere instant. Now, she could only hope that the forest was dark enough that day and Wei Jiu has too many things on his mind, so he probably forgot what she looked like.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, she forced herself to calm down and smiled apologetically, “I was practicing my legwork on the rooftop and happened to pass by here. I accidentally stepped on the rooftop. I’m willing to compensate with silver, may I ask if the innkeeper is downstairs?”</p>
<p>As she spoke, she took out her purse to go downstairs and talk to the innkeeper.</p>
<p>But the people surrounding her showed no intention of letting her go. The swords and knives rang loudly, pointing directly at Ranran’s delicate neck.</p>
<p>They were all high-level cultivators, and their footwork was not weak. Now that someone had eavesdropped on their Master’s conversation, they naturally didn’t need to keep any witnesses alive. So the falling swords and knives didn’t hold back, chopping straight down.</p>
<p>However, Ranran was slippery like an eel. With a twist of her waist, she slid between the blades, jumped onto a table, and darted around like a rabbit.</p>
<p>Just then, the long whip that had pulled her down came again, carrying spiritual power with it.</p>
<p>Ranran glanced and saw that it was the beautiful woman standing beside Wei Jiu who was swinging the whip. She should be Wei Jiu’s right-hand woman, the witch Tu Jiuyuan!</p>
<p>The ankle that had been entangled by the whip earlier was still throbbing with pain. Tu Jiuyuan’s figure was hot, and her whip carried an equally hot and relentless forcefulness . If she were entangled again, she probably will be badly injured.</p>
<p>When the whip attacked, her body reacted faster than her mind. Ranran quickly pulled out a mechanism stick made by her fourteenth Uncle Master, pressing the spring in the middle. Hooks popped out from both sides of the stick, caught the whip, and automatically tightened it. Then Ranran quickly wrapped the whip around, making it unable to cause trouble again.</p>
<p>Her actions were smooth and fluid, completely imitating her Shifu’s moves when he was fighting with Wei Jiu, using that rolling pin to capture his weapons. Even her pose was identical.</p>
<p>At this moment, the man who had been drinking tea and watching suddenly stared at this familiar move, slowly put down his teacup, and gritted his teeth, “Little girl, so it’s you!”</p>
<p>Although Tu Jiuyuan had pulled the girl down just now, as Ranran had expected, he hadn’t recognized her immediately. He had just felt that this girl looked strangely familiar.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until she displayed the technique of entwining the whip, triggering a humiliating memory in Wei Jiu’s mind, that he suddenly remembered this was the girl who had smiled at him while sitting in the tree during the array formation in the forest!</p>
<p>If he remembered correctly, she was Su Yi Shui’s disciple and had witnessed the whole process of him being made a fool of by Su Yi Shui…</p>
<p>Although this girl seemed to have grown a lot, and she appeared fair and beautiful under the bright daylight, but her smiling face just now was just like how she looked in the forest, truly hateful!</p>
<p>Wei Jiu didn’t intend for anyone to know about his visit at this time, but he didn’t expect to hear some movement on the rooftop and end up pulling down one of Su Yi Shui’s disciples.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu couldn’t help but smile slowly, admiring the look of fear and shock in the little girl’s widened pupils.</p>
<p>Since she was Su Yi Shui’s disciple, he couldn’t just kill her outright.</p>
<p>Since he couldn’t vent his anger on that Su for the time being, playing with this little girl was better than nothing. How should he slowly kill her to somewhat vent his resentment over these days!</p>
<p>Ranran heard Wei Jiu’s words and thought to herself, “This is bad!”</p>
<p>She didn’t check the almanac before leaving today, and she ended up tracking someone she shouldn’t mess with, after tracking her second senior brother. Wei Jiu was an archenemy of their Shifu, and now that he had recognized her, falling into his hands would probably be worse than death.</p>
<p>But her Shifu had said, don’t panic when encountering demons and monsters. Now that she was surrounded, she could only use the “Delay” Technique to save herself. With her thoughts swirling, Ranran could only awkwardly smile to ease the tense atmosphere, and then cheerfully said to Wei Jiu, “Shifu has been waiting outside. He sent me to invite Master Wei. Can Your Excellency come downstairs to meet him?”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Wei Jiu’s expression changed slightly. He thought he had kept his movements hidden and had even used the soul-catching technique “One Leaf Veils the Eyes” to manipulate Su Yi Water’s second disciple, allowing him to use her for his own purposes.</p>
<p>He hadn’t expected Su Yi Shui to have caught on so soon and even sent a disciple to eavesdrop on the rooftop. In that case, has his scheme failed?</p>
<p>He also didn’t think that this seemingly inexperienced little girl in front of him could be telling such barefaced lies with a straight face, making it really hard to tell if Su Yi Shui was really downstairs.</p>
<p>Ranran calmly flipped the stick, released the whip, and then pointed in the direction of the stairs, saying, “Shifu is here, and he has also invited Elder Mu. Didn’t you want to meet her? They are waiting for you downstairs!”</p>

<p>This bait was quite clever. Wei Jiu had always had some unspeakable sentiments for Mu Qingge. When he heard that Mu Qingge was together with Su Yi Shui, he was immediately bothered.</p>
<p>By the side, Tu Jiuyuan also showed a hint of jealousy. Her face tightened, unable to resist, she headed towards the stairs to see what was going on.</p>
<p>In the moment she turned,  a flaw in the encirclement appeared. Ranran seized this rare opportunity, silently recited a Flash technique, and with lightning speed, bounced up, leaped over those big men, and jumped down from the window.</p>
<p>Her agility was extraordinary. Although Tu Jiuyuan was quick to react and tried to use the whip to entangle her again, she missed the mark. What came back was just a pink shoe embroidered with tiny plum blossoms.</p>
<p>When Tu Jiuyuan jumped down the stairs, she only saw a startled crowd that immediately scattered, but she didn’t see the figure of that little girl anywhere.</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan cracked her whip angrily: “Little brat, next time I see you, it will be your death!”</p>
<p>In the time it took for her to turn around, Wei Jiu had already stood behind her, coldly saying, “Chase in the direction of the Tea Fragrance Mountain.”</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan hesitated, “But if Su Yi Shui is here too…”</p>
<p>Before she could finish, Wei Jiu had already grabbed her chin, smiling and saying, “Look at the useless trash I raised, not even as cunning as a little brat. If her Master were here, would she run away like a rabbit? Chase her down for me. It’s not easy to create this Bai Baishan as a pawn. We can’t let it go to waste!”</p>
<p>After saying that, he roughly pushed Tu Jiuyuan away. Tu Jiuyuan felt embarrassed by the mockery of her Excellency, signaled to her subordinates, and quickly leaped onto the roof, heading towards Tea Fragrance Mountain.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Wei Jiu picked up the embroidered shoe that Ranran had dropped and looked at it – this should have been sewn by the girl herself. There was just simple patterns on the shoe surface, but there seemed to be words embroidered on the insole. Wei Jiu squinted and saw four big characters embroidered on it, “To Pass Every Test.”</p>
<p>Around the four characters was a circle of sincere prayer chants.</p>
<p>It would seem that the Master’s tests at West Mountain was strict. As a disciple, she had actually come up with such a wishing technique.</p>
<p>Everyone knew that when the demonic cultivator Wei Jiu smiled, it meant someone was going to die. He looked at the embroidered shoe and smiled darkly: <em>Cunning little girl, when she is brought back here, he will  be sure to make her suffer!”</em></p>

<p>Ranran, after using a Flash technique to descend from the building, immediately blended into the crowd. After passing two streets, she encountered Gao Cang and Qiu Xier, who were tasting snacks in a pastry shop.</p>
<p>She only said “Wei Jiu is here” and the other two immediately turned pale with fear. The three of them then rushed out of the town at full speed. When they were about to run towards Tea Fragrance Mountain, Ranran closed her eyes and listened carefully, whispering, “Not good! Someone is chasing us!”</p>
<p>Since they had ambushed their second senior brother, they must know where their Shifu was hiding. Although Ranran had left the town just now, as long as Wei Jiu sent someone to chase in the direction of Cha Ming Mountain, they would definitely be caught.</p>
<p>Ranran knew that their Shifu had hidden Netherworld Spirit Spring on him. If Wei Jiu discovered this, there would be a fierce fight for it. If they were to fall into the hands of the Crimson Gate, their Shifu might be coerced by this demon… Right now they could only quickly inform their Shifu and ask for help.</p>
<p>With this in mind, she glanced at a magpie perched on a branch, then leaped up and swiftly caught the bird. From the charm pouch given to her by Elder Jiu, she took out a bird control charm and tied it to the magpie’s slender leg before releasing it.</p>
<p>With the bird controlled by the charm, it could now deliver messages like the crows of Cuiwei Mountain.</p>
<p>After doing this, she said briefly to her two fellow disciples, “The sound of the pursuers coming up behind us is very fast. We can’t outrun them. We can only delay now and wait for our Shifu and Uncle Master to come save us.”</p>
<p>After speaking, she looked around and saw a secluded mountain hollow with dense tree shade, perfect for hiding.</p>
<p>She then said, “Quick, let’s hide there. We need to meditate quickly and slow down our breathing. That way, we can evade the pursuers’ detection.”</p>
<p>When she eavesdropped in the teahouse earlier, she meditated and listened quietly. Even Wei Jiu didn’t notice her until she stood up later.</p>
<p>So now, they had to hide first, slow down their breathing, and see if they could escape the pursuers.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier and Gao Cang, having experienced trials in Wangxiang Pass, although they felt a bit panicked imagining Wei Jiu’s brutal methods of disembowelment, but they still reacted quickly to Ranran’s words and followed her to hide in the mountain hollow.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When the three of them sat cross-legged, silently reciting the Calming Heart Mantra they had been punished to write along the way. Surprisingly they quickly entered a state of meditation, reaching a state of selflessness. Not only did their breathing become slow and steady, but their heartbeats also gradually slowed down, almost as if they were dead.</p>
<p>The disciples of the Crimson Gate soon arrived at this location, but they suddenly couldn’t sense the traces of their targets, causing them to stop in their tracks and look at each other.</p>
<p>The surrounding area was dense with trees, providing ample hiding spots.</p>
<p>One of them drew a sharp arrow and shot dozens of arrows towards several hidden spots in the woods. Unfortunately, apart from the startled birds that flew away, there was no human sound.</p>
<p>So the disciples quickly continued to chase in the direction of Cha Ming Mountain.</p>
<p>When the pursuers passed by, Qiu Xier opened her eyes and took a sharp breath.</p>
<p>Because she just noticed that Ranran’s arm had been hit by an arrow, with blood gushing out. She couldn’t imagine how Ranran endured it when she was hit. Not only did she not make a sound, but she also managed to conceal her breathing.</p>
<p>Ranran, now recovered from her meditative state, felt a sharp pain in her arm. She had never experienced such suffering since childhood, so tears were swirling in her eyes.</p>
<p>“Little junior sister, let’s hurry and go. If we wait to be rescued, you might already have bled to death!” Qiu Xier urged with concern.</p>
<p>Ranran gritted her teeth and shook her head. “No, we can’t go anywhere now. We can only wait here. Tie my arm tightly with a cloth strip to slow down the blood flow. Then you two go first. Otherwise… I’ll only drag you down.”</p>
<p>Qiu Xier and Gao Cang exchanged glances. Gao Cang spoke first, “We won’t leave. We’ll stay here with you. If we leave you behind and go, how can we face your parents?”</p>
<p>Qiu Xier, who was initially undecided, agreed with what her senior brother said. She took out a handkerchief from her sleeve, tore it into strips, and bound Ranran’s arm tightly.</p>
<p>Ranran took a deep breath and tried to regulate her blood flow, slowing down her heartbeat to mimic a meditative state.</p>
<p>Even a swift bird would take about ten minutes to locate Shifu and deliver the message. It would also take time for their Shifu to arrive after receiving the message.<br/>*一盏茶 10 minutes</p>
<p>So now, all she could do was wait, ensuring she didn’t bleed to death before Shifu arrived.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, fate seemed unwilling to give her even that little bit of time.</p>
<p>Just after Qiu Xier had finished tending to Ranran’s wound, Ranran’s ears twitched, and then she whispered, “More people are coming, meditate quickly!”</p>
<p>The disciples of XiShan were not particularly skilled, but their basic meditation skills were solid, and they quickly entered a meditative state!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>This time, the newcomers were none other than the Elder of Crimson Gate, Tu Jiuyuan. She was uneasy and had brought two more disciples to investigate.</p>
<p>Their Excellency was currently recuperating and couldn’t use true qi, so such tasks of chasing down and eliminating people naturally fell to her, the capable right hand.</p>
<p>When they arrived here, Tu Jiuyuan didn’t notice anything at first. However, her red-eyed falcon suddenly moved its hooked beak and made a sharp cry. It then flapped its wings, attacking the hiding place of Ranran and the others like how it would attack a rabbit.</p>
<p>The Crimson Gate’s red-eyed falcons were raised on human flesh and blood from young, so they immediately sensed the smell of human blood and flew straight towards the injured Ranran.</p>
<p>Gao Cang and Qiu Xier quickly drew their weapons and, as the falcon swooped down, waved their swords to drive away the fierce bird’s sharp claws.</p>
<p>At this point, Tu Jiuyuan also saw the three people hiding in the mountain hollow. She couldn’t help but sneer, “How did Su Yishui train such a bunch of weaklings? Always hiding, not daring to fight back?”</p>
<p>Gao Cang, a hot-blooded youth willing to seek justice, couldn’t bear the mockery. He jumped up and drew his sword, ready to fight her.</p>
<p>But before he could even get close, Tu Jiuyuan caught him with her whip, and sent him flying straight into a nearby tree trunk.</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan’s wrist turned, and her whip now lashed towards the neck of the silly and dazed chubby girl.</p>
<p>She had already wasted too much time with these weaklings, Tu Jiuyuan was about to break her neck with one strike, then end the lives of the other two as well.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier was terrified, not knowing how to dodge at all. At this critical moment, she was suddenly pushed aside by Ranran.</p>
<p>Ranran had already broken off the long arrow on her arm. She picked up her mechanical staff again, entangling Tu Jiuyuan’s whip.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is now an old move, and Tu Jiuyuan was prepared. She swung her whip in time, pulling Ranran up and throwing her towards another sturdy tree trunk.</p>
<p>Well trained by Shifu’s stone-throwing practices, Ranran’s reflexes kicked in. As she was flung towards the tree, she grabbed a handful of leaves and threw them into the air. Then she let go of the whip with her staff, gliding lightly in the air, lightly touching the falling leaves with her toes, like she was a swan gracefully dancing in mid-air.</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan swung her whip several times, but couldn’t get close to the girl’s body. Feeling frustrated, she threw away her whip, drew out her twin daggers from her waist, ready to fight this slippery little girl hand-to-hand.</p>
<p>But as she thrust her daggers, she realized that the girl had turned her body, with legs split, hands poised, using Wei Jiu’s special technique Thunderous Sky Slash.</p>
<p>The disciples of the Crimson Gate all knew the power of this move; if struck, either death or serious injury awaited. Tu Jiuyuan, without time to think, instinctively dodged to the side.</p>
<p>Ranran seized this opportunity and shouted loudly, “Get into formation!”</p>
<p>This time, Gao Cang and Qiu Xier didn’t hesitate. They quickly took up their positions, forming a Demon-subduing formation.</p>
<p>Although their second senior brother was not there, the three of them could still form a *square formation. After silently reciting the mantra, they instantly became rooted in place.<br/>*品 <em>I guess this is close to a square lol</em></p>
<p>In fact, Ranran had improvised earlier, learning Wei Jiu’s moves from when he fought with Su Yishui in the Demon Vine Forest. It looked impressive but lacked any real power. However, she naturally had a good memory and managed to mimic it perfectly after just one look, enough to intimidate.</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan also realized this only after she dodged. Being tricked twice by this girl, she became enraged. As her whip struck out again, she was determined to kill this time.</p>
<p>Su Yishui’s self-arranged formation looked ordinary but was both offensive and defensive. These rookies, after experiencing trials in the Wangxiang River, had been focused on studying formations and had achieved some proficiency. Now, in actual combat, they were surprisingly adept at handling the situation.</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan swung her whip again, but even if the whip was as dense as raindrops, it couldn’t splash in.</p>
<p>But Ranran knew in her heart that her injured arm couldn’t hold up for too long. Once she fell, the formation would be broken, and none of them would survive, so… she absolutely couldn’t fall!</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan also noticed the gradually expanding bloodstain on her arm and knew she was the weakest link. So, she concentrated her attacks on Ranran, intending to crush this little girl.</p>
<p>Seeing how heavily injured her arm was and how young she was, logically this girl should be in a panic at this stage. However, while Tu Jiuyuan continued her relentless attacks, she noticed that the expression on this little girl’s face gradually became resolute, especially those eyes, which exuded an indescribable coldness…</p>
<p>Staring at her for a long time, it even stirred up memories that Tu Jiuyuan was reluctant to recall… It seemed like she had once fought fiercely with someone who had the same eyes before, and she had been defeated and begged for mercy back then…</p>
<p>Her frustrations building up to its peak, she was boiling with rage. Tu Jiuyuan suddenly bit her tongue and used a demonic technique that even a demonic cultivator wouldn’t easily use, sacrificing a portion of her own power to unleash all her potential, doubling her power in a short time, intending to end the battle quickly!</p>
<p>This time, the three *weaklings from Xishan couldn’t withstand the attacks anymore. Ranran was splashed with a mouthful of demon blood by Tu Jiuyuan and couldn’t open her eyes for a while, immediately being thrown by a whip.<br/>*虾兵蟹将<em> literally shrimp soldiers and crab generals</em></p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan burst into a maniacal laugh, thrusting her sword again towards the little girl’s heart…</p>
<p>But just as she was about to reach Ranran, a sudden powerful force attacked, propelling Tu Jiuyuan into the air, and she landed heavily on the ground, blood gushing from her mouth.</p>
<p>She looked closely and realized that Su Yishui had arrived with face full of fury, like a god descending from heaven. At this moment, Ranran couldn’t hold on anymore and fell from midair, landing squarely into Su Yishui’s arms.</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan didn’t even have time to react before Su Yishui struck her with his palm again. Having just depleted a portion of her power, she couldn’t even defend herself and was thrown back again. As blood gushed out of her mouth, Tu Jiuyuan knew that her mission to silence them had failed. She was severely injured and did not dare to linger in battle, quickly fleeing with her followers.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier looked closely and saw that it was Shifu carrying Little junior sister, his face ashen. She couldn’t help but say with tearful voice, “Shifu, you finally came!”</p>
<p>Su Yishui didn’t respond to her, but instead, he pressed a pressure point on Ranran to stop the bleeding.</p>
<p>Ranran was feeling weak from too much blood loss, and she struggled to open her eyes. She was gasping for breath as she told him, “Shifu… Second senior brother has been deceived by Crimson Gate with a sinister move. He’s in the second courtyard of Scholar Tree Lane in the town…”</p>
<p>Hearing Ranran speak with difficulty, Su Yishui’s tone was gruffly, “Be quiet, quickly adjust your breath to relieve pain!”</p>
<p>Ranran was very obedient and did become quiet. She didn’t even adjust her breathing because she had already passed out from the pain.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>It was convenient that she had fainted because when she woke up again, she was lying in a warm bed in the hot spring Inn room. Her injured arm had also been bandaged properly. Although there was still a little bit of pain, it didn’t seem to be a big deal. At least she could still stretch her arm to touch the bag of dried sweet potatoes snack by her pillow.</p>
<p>She had brought these sweet potatoes from Cuiwei Mountain. They were gifts from Elder Jiu. Those sweet potatoes grown in climates adjusted by talismans were especially sweet, not only suitable for making wine and also perfect for drying into sweet potato slices. They were chewy and aromatic…</p>
<p>At that moment, Qiu Xier, who brought in some porridge, was pleasantly surprised to see her awake. She put down the porridge with a face full of joy and said, “Little Miss, you finally woke up. Do you know how long you’ve been sleeping?”</p>
<p>Ranran thought for a moment and said, “I must have slept for three or four days, right?”</p>
<p>Qiu Xier didn’t expect her to guess it correctly and admired her while saying, “Exactly three days. But how did you guess?”</p>
<p>Ranran pointed to the dried sweet potatoes in her mouth, “They’re not as moist as before. Estimating the time they turned hard, it’s probably three or four days… Pass me the porridge quickly; I’m really hungry!”</p>
<p>This ability to estimate time as a gourmand was really unparalleled.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Qiu Xier was not in the mood to admire Ranran at all. She helped her up and fed her porridge while saying, “You’ve slept through *a whole day in the heavens. The human realm has changed drastically!”<br/>*天上一日 is from the phrase 天上一日, 地上一年 <br/><em>Its kind of like Interstellar’s time dilation; means many things happened during this time</em></p>
<p>Ranran was really hungry, so she ate while urging her senior sister not to keep her in suspense and tell her quickly about what had happened.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier then recounted everything from the beginning. The first thing was that Shifu was absolutely terrifying that day, rushing as he carried her, like he was possessed by a god-slayer, killing anyone who blocked the way.</p>
<p>The Crimson Gate trackers who couldn’t find their targets had later turned back and ran straight into the mouth of the volcano.</p>
<p>Recalling the scene, it was extremely brutal. When Shifu went on a killing spree, Wei Jiu’s savagery of disembowelment would seem mild.</p>
<p>“Tearing live people apart with his hands! And they were burned to ashes before even hitting the ground! In the blink of an eye, more than a dozen Crimson Gate disciples were gone, nothing was left…”</p>
<p>Qiu Xier couldn’t help but shivered again, then she spoke of another matter, “Second senior brother has been in a water vat being punished all this time. Shifu said he would disperse his foundation and drive him out of the sect…”</p>
<p>Ranran looked up, slightly widening her eyes.</p>
<p>It turned out that after Ranran fainted, Su Yishui immediately took her back to Cha Ming Mountain. Second Uncle Master took Gao Cang and Qiu Xier to look for Bai Baishan.</p>
<p>Perhaps because they knew Bai Baishan was already a useless pawn, or they were afraid of being caught by Su Yishui, Tu Jiuyuan did not return to the courtyard to tell them to retreat.</p>
<p>So when Second Uncle Master kicked open the door, she saw second senior brother lying on the bed with a dark, burly man, looking completely mesmerized. His mouth was still nuzzling the bearded face…</p>
<p>In Qiu Xier’s words, seeing that scene made her wish she could gouge out her eyeballs, and immediately forget the horrible sight she saw.</p>
<p>When the burly man saw someone break in, he tried to get up but was quickly immobilized by Second Uncle Master’s swift hands.</p>
<p>Second senior brother was still defending the burly man, cradling him in his arms, loudly telling everyone not to scare his Rou’er.</p>
<p>Second Uncle Master snorted and forcefully stuffed a Calming pill into Bai Baishan’s mouth. When Bai Baishan came back to his senses and saw the facial hair on his “Ruo’er,” he screamed in terror and kicked “Ruo’er” to the ground with one foot.</p>
<p>Then, perhaps recalling the intimate moments he had with “her” over the past few days, Bai Baishan immediately felt nauseated and vomited profusely, according to Qiu Xier’s recollection, even vomiting up meals from the previous night.</p>
<p>Although Bai Baishan was rescued in time by Second Uncle Master, he was tied up as soon as he reached the mountain. He kept pleading his innocence, claiming that he fell victim to a trick by the demonic sect, leading him astray by lust momentarily.</p>
<p>According to him, he was at first just blinded by the wind on the street when someone wiped his eyes with a wet handkerchief. When he opened his eyes, he saw an extremely beautiful girl and was captivated. She then asked him for directions, and that was their first meeting.</p>
<p>Later, when he went down the mountain to help Second Uncle Master buy things, he encountered the girl again. Because she was so beautiful, he couldn’t help but be tempted. However, such secret rendezvous with a beauty would surely be condemned by Shifu, so he sneaked down the mountain to meet her.</p>
<p>However, meeting the girl was always quite exhausting for him, and he would often doze off, but he swore he never did anything to betray his master.</p>
<p>Bai Baishan spoke convincingly, insisting that when little junior sister woke up, he won’t be afraid if she questioned him directly and he could then prove his innocence!</p>
<p>Su Yishui didn’t bother to interrogate him and just ordered him to be tied up temporarily and thrown into the water vat, where he soaked for three days.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Su Yishui personally brewed medicine every day for Ranran.</p>
<p>Now that Ranran was awake, she could confront second senior brother directly.</p>
<p>As he watched his junior sister approach, second senior brother, although tied up, couldn’t wait and stood up from the water vat, shouting, “Little junior sister, quickly tell Shifu that I didn’t betray him. It was the people from the demonic sect who tricked and took advantage of me. I’m the victim here!”</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Ranran cautiously stepped back and said to Su Yishui, “Shifu, he should be poisoned by the horned demon. Please don’t let come into contact with him…”</p>
<p>Yu Tong coldly remarked by the side, “Master also noticed the poison in him, so these past days he was left soaking in a vat filled with cow bezoar and incense ash. The poison should be mostly cleared by now.”</p>
<p>Hearing Second Uncle Master say this, Bai Baishan suddenly realized that these past few days of soaking was not a punishment but detoxification.</p>
<p>Thinking about how he had cursing bitterly while in the vat, feeling wronged, Bai Baishan couldn’t help but feel ashamed and couldn’t lift his head.</p>
<p>But since Shifu was willing to take care of him, does this mean he wouldn’t be expelled from the sect?</p>
<p>Su Yishui said mildly, “You’ve soaked in the Water of the horned demon for many days, damaging your foundation. Even if the poison has been removed, it cannot be reversed. So, there’s no need for me to disperse your skills. Our master-disciple relationship has come to an end. You can leave the mountain to marry and have children.”</p>
<p>This horned demon poison was very insidious, capable of preventing the gathering of true qi. Ground into powder and used for bathing, its effects were even more potent. Fortunately, Su Yishui had a bit of cleanliness obsession and never went to soak in the hot springs; otherwise, he would have been affected already. It was clear that Wei Jiu wanted to control second senior brother, to poison Su Yishui, then take advantage of the situation to overwhelm the people from XiShan, reclaim his core, and get his revenge!</p>
<p>Bai Baishan had always harbored the ambition of dominating the three major sects and becoming a legendary figure. But now, hearing that he was on the verge of becoming useless, he sat back in the vat and burst into tears.</p>
<p>With flowing tears he said that he didn’t do it on purpose. He wouldn’t dare to betray his master if not for being compelled by evil spirits. His master had great divine powers and extraordinary medical skills; surely, he would find a way to cure the poison from the horned demon.</p>
<p>The once dignified young man cried like a three-year-old rolling on the ground. Even the eldest senior brother and third senior sister couldn’t help but plead for him.</p>
<p>Su Yishui seemed unmoved as he listened, only saying slowly later on “Your Bai family risked themselves to save a Xishan Elder, and was seriously injured as a result. I’ve always remembered this favor, which is why I accepted you as my disciple. The poison in your body is deep. Even if I kept you at West Mountain, you would be useless. Moreover, you were seduced by lust, which endangered your fellow disciples and caused them to be injured. Originally, you should have atoned for this with your life, but now I am only expelling you from the sect, which also fulfills our master-disciple relationship. Go on, collect some silver from Yu Tong before leaving. You can start a small business at home and live a comfortable life.”</p>
<p>After saying this, he couldn’t be bothered to talk further with Bai Baishan and left directly.</p>
<p>Bai Baishan finally managed to rein in his sorrow, he couldn’t help but try to gather his true qi, only to find that his dantian was really completely empty, with nothing left.</p>
<p>Out of the few disciples who entered the sect with him, he considered himself to have the highest talent. Who would have thought he would be ambushed and lose all his cultivation over the past year in one go.</p>
<p>He was familiar with the unwritten rules of cultivation. Once branded as a disowned disciple, bearing the reputation of betraying the master, it would be difficult to turn things around. Other reputable orthodox sects would not accept him either.</p>
<p>Even Su Yishui, who had put righteousness before family and betrayed Mu Qingge in the past, although praised verbally by the righteous path, was still secretly looked down upon by them for his actions.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But until the end, Su Yishui still refused to see him again. He was given some money before being told to leave Cha Ming Mountain.</p>
<p>Bai Baishan refused to leave and knelt at the foot of the mountain, even enduring heavy rain without getting up.</p>
<p>Su Yishui ignored the one who stubbornly refused to leave. After clarifying that it was Qiu Xier who had proposed to go down the mountain, she was also punished with a bamboo board beating along with Gao Cang, leaving them unable to move for a day, and could only sit on soft cushions.</p>
<p>Ranran felt that she had also made a major mistake this time. It was only because she had been unconscious and managed to escape, but she didn’t know how Shifu would punish her now.</p>

<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>However, Shifu has not yet handed out her punishment. It would seem that the feeling of waiting, was even more uncomfortable than receiving the punishment itself.</p>
<p>In the evening, Rannran pleaded with Second Senior Uncle to send two flatbreads to second senior brother who was still kneeling below the mountain, so he wouldn’t faint from hunger. She also tried to stay inside the house and avoid running into Shifu.</p>
<p>But since she had already slept for three days already, it wasn’t appropriate to lounge in bed any longer. The next day, Ranran got dressed and went to the bamboo forest near the inn for a stroll. Coincidentally she saw Shifu returning from hunting on the mountain.</p>
<p>The little white tiger followed behind him, proudly carrying two rabbits in its mouth.</p>
<p>Su Yishui saw her and said, “It’s time to change your dressing.”</p>
<p>Ranran saw that her master’s expression had gone back to normal and not as angry as when he drove second senior brother away yesterday, so she obediently followed him back to the house.</p>
<p>After the little white tiger put down the rabbits, it sensibly brought Su Yishui’s medicine treatment box in its mouth. It then flopped down nearby to watch Su Yishui change Ranran’s dressing.</p>
<p>The bloody wound on her glistening white arm was very conspicuous. Normally, after a few days, the wound should have scabbed over. However, Ranran’s arm was still bleeding, barely stopped by the hemostatic powder applied to it.</p>
<p>Watching her master’s skilled movements, Ranran wondered if he had been personally bandaging her wound these past few days?</p>
<p>Ranran felt a bit embarrassed and said, “I have always had this kind of constitution since I was young. Once injured, I can never stop bleeding. My parents were very worried and consulted many doctors, but it didn’t help. So, they never let me leave the yard, afraid that I might fall and get hurt outside.”</p>
<p>Su Yishui remained silent and did not speak. He quickly applied the medicine powder to her wound and then wrapped it with clean cloth slowly. The techniques of a Divine healer were sublime, and Ranran was accidentally mesmerized watching Shifu’s side profile, and didn’t even feel any pain.</p>
<p>After dressing the wound, Su Yishui finally spoke: “Yesterday, I drove Bai Baishan away, only you did not intercede for him. Why is that?”</p>
<p>Ranran said in a small voice, “Would my plea have made a difference?”</p>
<p>Even Second Uncle Master couldn’t help but plead for him, but Shifu ignored it too, didn’t he?</p>
<p>Su Yishui listened to his disciple’s question with an expressionless face, and for a moment, his feelings were hard to discern.</p>
<p>This was not a time to be disingenuous, Ranran could only answer honestly, “You told us that copying the Calming Heart Mantra daily is to build the foundation of our cultivation, making one clear-minded and upright. Copying it everyday, besides dispelling evil energies, it also has the same effect in resisting enchantments and unorthodox practices. But second senior brother, apart from initially going through the motions, rarely did it consistently afterward. When we arrived at Cha Ming Mountain, he basically stopped altogether. If he had been diligent in his studies and not slacked off, even if he had been ambushed by Crimson Gate, he wouldn’t have been ensnared by their enchantments and made such a mistake. So, even though he didn’t intend to make a mistake, he already laid the groundwork for trouble. There must be a reason why Shifu didn’t want to teach him, so why should I make things difficult for you?”</p>
<p>After saying these words, she looked up at Su Yishui, but found him looking at her with mixed emotions in his eyes.</p>
<p>“I thought you had been fellow disciples with him for a year and would surely feel sorry for him… You used to be so soft-hearted…”</p>
<p>Although Ranran didn’t understand why Su Yishui would say something like “you used to be soft-hearted” but second senior brother’s mistake was indeed caused by himself: “Ignoring minor offenses leads to major ones. In the path of cultivation, one gains abilities beyond ordinary mortals, and if an evil person is nurtured, wouldn’t it be harmful for millennia? If second senior brother didn’t have a clear purpose for cultivation, it would be better for him to leave the sect. His desires were merely to stand at the pinnacle and be admired, if that was the case, he might as well study and take the imperial exam which is probably a faster way to achieve fame and success… However…”</p>
<p>She dragged the “however,” then spoke softly, “Second senior brother certainly has his faults, but Shifu, you also have your shortcomings…”</p>
<p>Su Yishui calmly asked, “What did I do wrong?”</p>
<p>“We disciples are youths with unstable mindsets… Good and evil are often just a thought away. Shifu, you knew that the Spirit Spring had harmful effects, yet you never supervised our studies. If you had been stricter, second senior brother wouldn’t have caused such trouble…”</p>
<p>Su Yishui listened expressionlessly. He suddenly said, “So it’s my fault as a master?”</p>
<p>Ranran regretted for saying too much and quickly said, “Your disciple dares not. Shifu has his reasons for everything he does.”</p>
<p>Su Yishui said expressionlessly, “I am also human, why wouldn’t I make mistakes? If one day you find that I’m an abominable person, what will you do?”</p>
<p>Ranran felt that her exam-loving master was suddenly testing her again, making her a bit flustered. This exam question was really tricky.</p>
<p>She clearly would not pass if she said she would take the side of an evil-doer, but if she said she would act righteously and kill her master to prove her path, she feared she would follow second senior brother’s footsteps and be driven out of the sect.</p>
<p>Using her toes to grip her only “To Pass Every Test” insole that was left, Ranran earnestly replied, “Shifu, with your lofty character, how could you possibly do evil? If such a day truly comes, there must be compelling reasons behind it. Your disciple is not talented, but I am willing to accompany you, endure condemnation by both heaven and earth, to stand through thick and thin with you!”</p>
<p>Perhaps her insole manifested its divine power, because after hearing this extremely brown-nosing answer, there was actually a hint of bitterness… and pain that flashed across Shifu’s normally indifferent face, as if her answer had stirred up unpleasant memories.</p>
<p>As Ranran waited nervously, her master said, “Remember, from now on, you are not to leave my side for even half a step!”</p>
<p>Ranran raised her eyes, feeling that this rule was rather odd. She tried to argue and said “……Shifu, your Sect rule seems to be a little imprecise. Even married couples don’t stick together all day. How do you quantify this half a step? There is no way to be together all the time, especially during sleep and bathing?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui looked at his little disciple’s mischievous expression, his eyes shone and he suddenly lowered his head and leaned down, “If you can’t do it, I will help you do it…”</p>
<p>Caught off guard by her master’s sudden closeness that enveloped her, Ranran could only stare blankly at Su Yishui’s eyes, their noses almost touching.</p>
<p>His eyes were deep and filled with meanings Ranran couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>Just then, Yutong happened to come in carrying a specially made arm cast. Since Ranran couldn’t move her arm freely due to the injury, Uncle Master Zeng made a lightweight support to stabilize her arm and prevent the wound from splitting open.</p>
<p>But she hadn’t expected such an ambiguous scene when she lifted the door curtain. Xue girl’s face, was about to touch the Master’s…</p>
<p>If she had entered a moment later… Yutong was startled and didn’t dare to think further.</p>
<p>Although, such scenes were quite common twenty years ago.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge, who often appeared carefree and idle, would corner the stoic Young Master at the corridor, forcing him to stand against the wall with her hand by his ear, teasing him with ambiguous words… completely like a flirtatious libertine gentleman teasing girls in the marketplace!</p>
<p>Every time she saw the Master’s tightly clenched fists by his side loosen and then clench again, she was filled with righteous indignation, and felt that Mu Qingge was too much of a bully!</p>
<p>But now, the situation has turned upside down…</p>
<p>Seeing Ranran nervously pinching her skirt with her fingers… Hmm, the Master is being too strict with his disciples! Even if he is disciplining them, there’s no need to get so close, look at how scared the poor girl is?</p>
<p>Adhering to the belief that everything the Master does is right, Yu Tong spontaneously resolved the meaning behind the scene before her and quickly smiled, saying, “Master, she already knows she was wrong. Now, Bai Baishan has been expelled from the sect, Gao Cang and Xi’er have also been punished. As for Ranran, she’s already injured, so naturally she knows she was wrong too. Isn’t that right, Ranran…”</p>
<p>Saying this, Yu Tong winked at Ranran, indicating that she should quickly admit her mistake to the Master.</p>
<p>Ranran nodded dully with a bit of self-reflection; she did indeed talk back to Shifu earlier.</p>
<p>Shaking her head to dispel the ambiguous scene just now, Ranran was even more worried about Wei Jiu using such underhanded tactics that was truly difficult to guard against. Besides, he was going to meet Mu Xianchang in Huayang Mountain in three days; who knows what tricks he would use against Elder Mu this time.</p>
<p>However, when Ranran mentioned this, Su Yishui didn’t seem to care and said, “Why should we outsiders worry about Elder Mu’s affairs? Oh right, you haven’t been punished for sneaking down the mountain without permission yet. Since you’re injured, you’re exempted from a beating. Go! Write the ‘Wind Riding Spell’ four hundred times!”</p>
<p>Ranran’s expression fell slightly. Why did the cursed Crimson Gate’s lackeys have to shoot her left arm? If it was her right arm, wouldn’t she have avoided being punished?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>However, for unknown reasons, on the third day when Bai Bashan knelt shakily at the foot of the mountain, Su Yishui suddenly asked the Senior Uncle Master to bring him back.</p>
<p>Su Yishui told Bai Baishan that if he wanted to return to the sect, he could, but he had to stay with Uncle Master Zeng and learn to use his feet instead of his hands.</p>
<p>Enduring hardships was necessary to rethink the true meaning of being human.</p>
<p>If one day, Bai Baishan could assemble a self-ringing clock with his own feet, showing his strong determination, then Su Yishui would retract his previous words and accept him back under the XiShan Sect.</p>
<p>Bai Baishan was ecstatic upon hearing this and immediately expressed to the master that no matter how difficult the task was, he would do his best to complete it.</p>
<p>Ranran, however, had asked the master in a probing manner if her offensive words that day had caused him to change his mind.</p>
<p>But Su Yishui, while adjusting the strings of the zither, mildly replied, “Keeping rebellious disciple, in order to understand the hardships of being a Master. I wasn’t teaching you all seriously before, so I need to punish myself a bit and find some trouble for myself..”</p>
<p>Ranran was somewhat uncertain whether the “rebellious disciple” he mentioned referred to second senior brother or herself, who didn’t know her place. But since Shifu was willing to forgive second senior brother and gave him another chance, she was still happy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Qiu Xier and Cao gang were also quite frightened after the fact. Second senior brother’s matter had served as a wake-up call for these lazy ones. Although Shifu seemed to be training them in a relaxed style, if they really did something wrong, the punishment would still be severe.</p>
<p>So, even though the scenery of Cha Ming Mountain was still beautiful, the hot springs were still comfortable to soak in, and the town at the foot of the mountain was also bustling, Gao Cang and Xi’er dared not be lazy anymore. They would get up early every day to meditate their cultivation foundation and memorize various spell techniques.</p>
<p>Although Ranran’s injury could have been a good excuse for slacking off, she did not dare to use it either. Apart from copying the spell mantras as punishment, she earnestly studied the books brought by Master Uncle.</p>
<p>As for second senior brother, he diligently trimmed his toenails and soaked his feet in white vinegar, and began practicing using his feet instead of hands with Master Uncle Zeng. Even during meals, he used his feet to hold the spoon.</p>
<p>However, he could not meditate and cultivate with everyone else for now; he moved to the hot spring’s workers’ quarters to live.</p>
<p>During the day, he also had to do some manual labor at the hot spring to offset the cost of meals.</p>
<p>The arm cast made by Master Uncle Zeng was very useful to Ranran. When she had free time from studying, she would go to the garden to pick flowers and place them in a bottle on Master Uncle Zeng’s workshop table.</p>
<p>On this day, she came to the garden again for a walk and saw a large bunch of gardenias blooming by the pond. She decided to do today’s meditation exercises here.</p>
<p>So she found a mat, sat by the pond watching the fish, and slowly entered a state of meditation.</p>
<p>This pond was close to Master Uncle Zeng’s workshop, and she could hear him grinding parts with a small file once she entered meditation.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Master Uncle Zeng had mentioned that he wanted to make her a lightweight soft silver armor—a type that was impervious to knives and spears. This armor was said to be made by winding a strong vine from the south around soft silver thread and interwoven into a latticework , a very laborious process.</p>
<p>At that time, Ranran had watched for a while and told  Master Uncle Zeng that it wasn’t necessary since she would be by Shifu’s side in the future, wouldn’t dare to casually leave the mountain again, and so she wouldn’t encounter any more dangers.</p>
<p>But Master Uncle Zeng insisted on making it.</p>
<p>Just then, she heard familiar footsteps, it should be Shifu Su Yishui.</p>
<p>Master Uncle Zeng spoke, “Have you considered what I mentioned to you before? Keeping her here with me, is the best choice. If she follows you, sooner or later, the same disaster may happen again…”</p>
<p>Before he could finish, Su Yishui coldly interrupted, “No need, she must stay with me.”</p>
<p>Then came a long sigh from Master Uncle Zeng, “For her, its just matters from a past life; she has let go of everything. Why can’t you let go? Since you promised her an ordinary life, why not persist until the end, and also give her a tranquil and comfortable life?”</p>
<p>After hearing this, there was a very long silence. After quite a while, a low and deep voice murmured, “I have never taken it up, so how can I let it go?”</p>
<p>After saying this sentence, Shifu walked away with large strides.</p>
<p>This conversation had no context and Ranran could not make head or tail of it. But she also didn’t mean to eavesdrop intentionally; it’s just that her ears were too sharp when she was meditating, always catching snippets of others’ private matters.</p>
<p>This time, Ranran didn’t rush to get up. She waited until Shifu had walked far away before standing up from the flowerbed. Returning to the house, her mind was still pondering over who they were talking about.</p>
<p>But perhaps it was an old acquaintance of Shifu and Master Uncle Zeng; it was normal if she didn’t know who it was. But who was Shifu unable to take up, and unable to let go? Was it a man or a woman?</p>
<p>But Shifu was determined in wanting to keep her by his side…</p>
<p>Supporting her chin, Ranran pondered for a while but couldn’t figure anything out.</p>
<p>It seemed like she would have to ask Second Uncle Master when she had the chance. After all, Shifu had been cultivating for so long; did he ever think about finding an immortal companion?</p>
<p>Suddenly, she had a flash of insight. Could they be talking about… Second Uncle Master, Yu Tong?</p>
<p>A woman who had been with Shifu for a long time, wasn’t that only Yutong? She had grown up with Shifu since childhood, that’s almost like childhood sweethearts, right?</p>
<p>Ranran suddenly realized, thinking how Shifu didn’t seem to speak to Yutong much on most days, he was indeed very subtle in hiding his affection for her!</p>
<p>It seemed that she should remind third senior sister to be careful in front of Second Uncle Master because she might become their Master’s wife in future!</p>
<p>But if that were the case, wouldn’t Elder Mu be lovesick for two lifetimes in vain, unable to be together with the one she loved?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After a period of recuperation in Cha Ming Mountain, those few with frostbite were recovering well, and it was time to return to the Western Mountains.</p>
<p>After Wei Jiu’s losses and recent setbacks, he seems to have quieted down for a while, and he did not come looking to confront Su Yishui.</p>
<p>But recently, there were strange changes in the sky, frequent thunderstorms occurring, mostly concentrated around the famous mountains where cultivators gathered.</p>
<p>It seemed that many powerful beings were about to ascend, and such violations of the natural order naturally attracted heavenly anomalies.</p>
<p>At this time, the ginseng fruit on the Rebirth Tree would be very useful. Unfortunately, Mu Qingge had already thought of a countermeasure.</p>
<p>After leaving Wangxiang Pass, she hid in the Great Qi Imperial Palace under the pretext of refining pills for the Emperor.</p>
<p>The Founding Emperor of Great Qi was once a powerful cultivator who gave up halfway, unable to cultivate immortality but continued on a high note to become emperor. When the palace was built, they sought guidance from a highly skilled master and arranged it according to the Fuxi Eight Trigrams Formation, laying countless Spirit Absorption Stones in the palace’s foundation.</p>
<p>So, anyone with extraordinary abilities who entered this Palace would be disturbed in their spiritual power and would not pose a threat to the imperial heirs of Great Qi.</p>
<p>This was why Mu Qingge has chosen to hide here. Even though she couldn’t use her cultivation spiritual powers, there was also no fear of being caught.</p>
<p>Regardless of lightning and thunder on those various mountain peaks, she just had to hide safely and enjoy the Emperor’s hospitality in the palace.</p>
<p>And even though she now had a new furnace, she claimed that she was injured by Wei Jiu’s Grudge water and her spiritual power was damaged, so she couldn’t use the furnace. This excuse allowed her to smoothly avoid showing any weakness.</p>
<p>Su Yu really pampered Mu Qingge. For her living convenience, Su Yu allocated an entire corner of the West Palace to her, with a special Palace gate for her to facilitate entry and exit. Not only did he assign servants to attend to her, he also provided her with luxurious clothing, food, and various treasures. Even the most favored concubines in the palace were not as privileged as Mu Qingge.</p>
<p>Such treatment, comparable to that of an Imperial Tutor, was truly the envy of others.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>One day, a Visiting Notice came from outside the palace, saying that Wen Hongshan from the KongShan Sect wanted to visit the War Goddess.</p>
<p>Upon hearing that Wen Hongshan wanted to see her, Mu Qingge raised her eyebrows disapprovingly. Perhaps this Wen Immortal lady wanted to talk to her about making amends, asking her to contribute her cultivation to aid their sect’s Abbess Wen in facing her lightning trials, or something along those lines.</p>
<p>Originally, she didn’t want to see her, but thinking that she could learn about the current situation of the KongShan Sect from her, Mu Qingge ordered someone to bring Wen Hongshan in.</p>
<p>Once a beautiful woman of the KongShan Sect, how splendid she was back then!</p>
<p>She had once become the savior of Su Yishui’s mother by seeking spiritual medicine for her. Under Su Yishui’s mother’s wishes, the two almost got married as Cultivation companions while Su Yishui was still in the Jiuhua Sect.</p>
<p>However, Mu Qingge tricked Su Yishui into swearing a Soul oath, and after losing a bet to her, he left the Jiuhua Sect and was forced to join the XiShan Sect, which put an end to their marriage plans.</p>
<p>And later on, when Mu Qingge got jealous and slashed Wen Hongshan’s face, Wen Hongshan went to Su Yishui, crying about her grievances. Su Yishui was furious, accusing Mu Qingge of being unreasonable and cruel. The two even came to blows, and Su Yishui eventually left the XiShan Sect.</p>
<p>What a pity, the once enchanting Miss Wen who captivated Su Yishui, now had scars on her face, and her once youthful face is now weary from the passage of time. Mu Qingge was very willing to see up close, the pitiful state of the present Wen Hongshan.</p>
<p>When Mu Qingge, dressed in golden silk robes, appeared before Wen Hongshan, the latter’s state of decline was indeed highlighted to the fullest extent.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge was very satisfied with this feeling of looking down at her. She smiled and asked, “I wonder, what brings Miss Wen here?”</p>
<p>Wen Hongshan said coldly, “I have some private matters to discuss with you. Please dismiss the attendants so that our conversation won’t be overheard.”</p>
<p>Mu Qingge felt that Wen Hongshan was playing tricks, so she smiled faintly and stood up, ready to leave.</p>
<p>She just wanted to see the current sorry state of the woman whom Su Yishui had once been obsessed with; she wasn’t interested in what she had to say.</p>
<p>But just as she was about to leave, Wen Hongshan asked in a low voice, “Who… are you!”</p>
<p>This question made Mu Qingge pause, and her pupils slightly dilated.</p>
<p>However, she calmly waved away the attendants and waited until only the two of them were left before smiling and asking, “Miss Wen, your question is quite strange. What do you mean by ‘who am I’? Of course, I am Mu Qingge.”</p>
<p>Wen Hongshan stared straight into her eyes, sneering, “When you were on Jue mountain, you apologized to me, saying you were sorry for injuring my face when you were possessed.”</p>
<p>Mu Qingge smiled at her, asking in a probing manner, “Are you unwilling to forgive me and have come to settle scores with me?”</p>
<p>Wen Hongshan suddenly burst into laughter, her scars looking more grotesque due to her hearty laughter. She managed to stop laughing and then said coldly, “Everyone thinks that the scars on my face were caused by Mu Qingge, but only she and I know it’s not true. Back then, I devised a plan to let Su Yishui misunderstand her, so I deliberately put my face near her and got scratched by her sword. However, I didn’t know that Mu Qingge’s sword had just killed a poisonous snake, and the venom had not yet cleared, so the small wound festered badly, leaving behind this scar. Because I had set her up, Mu Qingge did not deign to look at me ever again. But you actually apologized to me because of my face?”</p>
<p>Wen Hongshan’s words made Mu Qingge’s expression stiffen slightly. She forced a smile, saying, “I don’t know what you’re talking about?”</p>
<p>Wen Hongshan looked at her with disdain in her eyes, “You think you’re Mu Qingge just because you have this face? Little do you know, anyone who knows her can tell at a glance that you are just a fake!”</p>
<p>Mu Qingge’s face tightened at these words, and she suddenly made a move, attacking Wen Hongshan.</p>
<p>Wen Hongshan’s visit was actually just a probe, but she didn’t expect to expose the fake so quickly with just one test.</p>
<p>As the adopted daughter of the KongShan Sect’s Abbess Wen, she naturally had excellent fighting skills. Although Mu Qingge’s attack was fierce, she dealt with it calmly and with ease, still smiling as she said, “I heard from the people of Crimson Gate that there were two fruits on that tree. I was doubtful at first, but unexpectedly, it seems to be true…”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Mu Qingge’s heart tightened, and she quickly stopped her attack, asking urgently, “What are you saying? You know that there were two fruits on that tree? Where is the other spiritual fruit?”</p>
<p>Wen Hongshan dodged to the side, observing the reaction of this fake, and couldn’t help but be amused, “You actually don’t know the whereabouts of the other spiritual fruit?”</p>
<p>She originally thought this was another cunning scheme of Mu Qingge’s, using a fake to divert attention while she enjoyed her freedom in hiding. She didn’t expect this fake to be unaware of the other spiritual fruit, which was quite entertaining.</p>

<p>When Wen Hongshan saw Mu Qingge, who emerged from the spiritual fruit and proceeded to apologize to her, she became suspicious.</p>
<p>As for the matter of the two spiritual fruits, that intel was obtained by interrogating a member of the Crimson Gate sect captured by their sect that day.</p>
<p>Because Wei Jiu had previously searched the villages below the mountain, looking for a girl born in the Qinggeng year, Wen Hongshan, after inquiring around, deduced the truth behind the matter.</p>
<p>Her visit this time was to probe the fake, and to see if she could uncover the whereabouts of the real Mu Qingge. Unexpectedly, this fake also seemed unaware, which was quite intriguing.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge, did not need a Grudge water attack at this moment to feel her blood run cold all over — what she feared most still happened, someone had discovered that two fruits had formed on the Rebirth tree.</p>
<p>In other words, the fruit that should have perished long ago might still be alive?</p>
<p>Mu Qingge’s hands trembled, her mind in chaos.</p>
<p>When she had thought “she” was gone, she had felt a moment of sadness. She then thought that she would live out her life well for “her” too, this way, she could feel much more at ease.</p>
<p>But now, hearing the shocking news that “she” might still be alive, her heart was more fearful than joyful right now.</p>
<p>Su Yishui had been abnormally cold to her… Could it be that he also knew the secret of the Rebirth tree bearing two fruits?</p>
<p>Thinking about how he actually knew but coldly watched her put on an act, a sense of humiliation surged through her.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge took a deep breath and regained her composure, saying, “Did you come here just to say these incomprehensible words to me? You mentioned another fruit on the Rebirth tree, where is it now?”</p>
<p>Wen Hongshan, seeing that the imposter was still putting up a front, didn’t get angry but chuckled twice before saying, “Let me guess, who you are? Mu Qingge fell into the ambush set up by the three major sects because she was anxious to rescue her sister Mu Ranwu, who had fallen into a ‘difficult situation’. Little did she know, this was a death trap set up by her own sister with outsiders. Tut tut, Mu Ranwu, though she’s Mu Qingge’s sister, her aptitude is mediocre, with no accomplishments in cultivation, easily forgottable, leaving no impression. But this harmless-looking existence has a cunning and insidious mind, ready to harm her own sister without hesitation.”</p>
<p>“Shut up! If you dare to speak nonsense again, you won’t walk out of this palace in Great Qi!” Bloodshot veins appeared in Mu Qingge’s eyes, her voice suddenly hoarse, clearly using real qi and no longer able to maintain her calm facade.</p>
<p>Hearing her threat, Wen Hongshan coldly laughed again, “It seems you really are Mu Ranwu… You are quite something. Who would have thought that such an inconspicuous girl would have such extraordinary abilities. If that is how things are, we can cooperate.”</p>
<p>Mu Qingge, or rather Mu Ranwu, narrowed her eyes, “What do you mean by cooperation?”</p>
<p>Wen Hongshan said coldly, “Mu Qingge and our three major sects are sworn enemies. We must not let her escape and become stronger!”</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu also looked back at her coldly, after thinking for a moment, finally smiled slowly, “How do you want to cooperate with me, let’s hear it.”</p>
<p>Wen Hongshan clenched her fist and said word by word, “Of course, we must locate her first!”</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu smiled, her mind quickly thinking, and finally said, “Okay, I hope we can cooperate happily this time. But before that, I’ll have to trouble Miss Wen to help me with something.”</p>
<p>After speaking, she whispered softly in Wen Hongshan’s ear. Wen Hongshan’s eyes widened as she listened, “How dare you…”</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu lightly placed a finger on her lips and made a gesture, “Miss Wen, to achieve great things, you must dare to take risks no one else dares to take, don’t you think it’s time to change the leader of Kongshan Sect?”</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Away from the chaos in the palace, let’s talk about Xue Ranran who followed her master to travel around. After returning to Western Mountain, the first thing she did was to take the gifts she bought for her parents and prepare to go down the mountain to see them.</p>
<p>However, the new sect rule stated: “Not allowed to leave Shifu’s side for even half a step.” If she wanted to go down the mountain, she naturally had to consult her master to see if he could make an exception for her to visit her family.</p>
<p>Although cultivators were supposed to cut off ties with the mortal world, Su Yishui was very understanding of his half-hearted disciple. After listening to her, he nodded and said, “I’ll accompany you.”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran was also very happy to hear this, “My mother makes delicious beancurd, and it’s even better with deep-fried red bean cakes! I’ll have my mother make it for you Shifu!”</p>
<p>But when she was going down the mountain, she had big and small bags, a lot of things to carry. As Senior brother Gao cang had been punished by their master last time for helping her carry things up the mountain, he didn’t dare to be overly attentive this time.</p>
<p>So Ranran had to carry her belongings along the rugged mountain road by herself.</p>
<p>But after a few steps, Su Yishui reached out and took the things she was carrying, saying, “Your arm injury has not fully healed yet, you need to rest it.”</p>
<p>After saying that, he walked on ahead with long strides.</p>
<p>Men who look like immortals could hold whisks or long swords, they can hold flutes or xiao, but carrying bags of local specialties and colorful fabrics did not seem quite harmonized.</p>
<p>This demeanor of accompanying the newlywed wife to visit her family … it really compromises the graceful and ethereal aura of her Shifu!</p>
<p>Ranran, walking behind, felt both touched and sorry.</p>
<p><em>Shifu! Your affection for your disciple, the only way to repay it is by *serving you, sir, diligently and loyally…</em><br/><br/>* from 中国二十四孝故事 <em> the 24 tales of filial piety</em>: <br/><em>扇枕温衾 Using a fan to keep the parent cool in summer, using body to warm parent in winter</em><br/>卧冰求鲤 <em>Someone who removed their robe, used their body to melt the frozen ice to capture two carps to feed his ill parents, who actually did not love him</em></p>
<p>So Ranran clenched her fists, made a silent vow, and quickly followed behind her master, walking briskly and humming a tune along the way.</p>
<p>Although Su Yishui had long legs, he didn’t walk fast. He gradually fell behind Ranran and watched as the morning dew sprinkled among the trees, casting an exceptionally vibrant and dazzling light on the girl ahead of him…</p>
<p>Suddenly she turned around, revealing a set of pearly white teeth, and shouted with a smile, “Shifu, hurry up! Look, there are squirrels fighting up ahead!”</p>
<p>Unconsciously, his accustomed icy expression seemed to melt a little under the warm and sunny smile of the girl…</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the town below the mountain, smoke was rising, and the villagers were starting to move around.</p>
<p>The Xue couple ran a breakfast stall and woke up very early. When Xue Ranran brought her master to the breakfast stall in town, the three small tables smeared with oil stains were already seated full of people.</p>
<p>Business was good, but Qiaolian’s face had no smiles, as if there were worries between her brows. It wasn’t until she looked up to collect money and saw her daughter hopping to her that she greeted her with a surprised and joyous expression.</p>
<p>“Good girl, when did you come back? Mother didn’t know! Oh, Elder Su, why are you here too? Come, come inside and sit down!”</p>
<p>The arrival of this master and disciple pair stunned the people eating at the stall.</p>
<p>My, where did this handsome couple come from? They made people’s eyes wander back and forth, not knowing who to stare at.</p>
<p>Qiaolian greeted her daughter and Elder Su, but her eyes were fixed on her daughter: this was her daughter… but how did she look so beautiful after just over a month? Although her features were still vaguely the same as the little girl she raised, Qiaolian felt that her daughter’s temperament and grace had become… indescribably beautiful.</p>
<p>For a mother, seeing her daughter *blossom into a woman, was a pride that overflowed from within, so after a slight surprise, she was filled with satisfaction and pride.<br/>*女大十八变 <em>literally a woman changes drastically at 18</em></p>
<p>Qiaolian smiled and accepted the compliments from the neighbors, then respectfully invited Elder Su to the house behind the stall, took a cloth and wiped the small wooden tables in the courtyard repeatedly, then had her daughter bring the prepared beancurd for Elder Su to try.</p>
<p>The toppings for Qiaolian’s beancurd were Ranran’s recipe, with sweet and savory options. After confirming that Shifu preferred the sweet flavor, Ranran prepared a bowl of beancurd with peanut and red bean for him.</p>
<p>After Qiaolian was finished the front, she hurried back to attend to Elder Su. As she looked at her daughter who asked if she liked the fabrics she bought, Qiaolian smiled and stroked her daughter’s face, saying, “Everything my little girl buys is the best.”</p>
<p>In the past few times, they had met hastily at the pavilion below the mountain. But this time, they saw Elder Su, she naturally asked when her daughter would be able to graduate from the Sect.</p>
<p>When she heard that her daughter might have to practice cultivation on the Western Mountain for a long time, Qiaolian looked hesitant, “Then… won’t she… be unable to marry and have children?”</p>
<p>Xue Liangui was afraid that his wife’s question would displease the immortal and endanger their daughter’s life. He quickly interrupted Qiaolian’s words and gave her a wink.</p>
<p>“Is it so important whether she marries or not? We are commoners, if Ranran marries now, she won’t find a good match anyway. Wouldn’t it be a lifetime of regrets?”</p>
<p>Qiaolian, after hearing Xue Liangui’s words, unexpectedly turned her back and covered her mouth, unable to hold back her tears.</p>
<p>Ranran was startled and quickly went over to ask her mother what was wrong.</p>
<p>But Qiaolian looked at Su Yishui and hesitated to speak.</p>
<p>Su Yishui put down the beancurd and said to Ranran, “I’ll go take a walk around the street, don’t wander around, I’ll come back to pick you up later.”</p>
<p>After saying that, Su Yishui stood up and went out, giving the Xue family of three some time alone.</p>
<p>Su Yishui was tall, had a cold demeanor, and wasn’t very approachable. When he sat in the courtyard, the Xue couple felt somewhat uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Now that Elder Su had left, the couple breathed a sigh of relief. Ranran was observant and had noticed her mother’s agitation. She didn’t know which of her father’s words had triggered her mother to cry.</p>
<p>So she asked her mother what had happened at home.</p>
<p>Qiaolian had been restless these past few days, unable to eat or sleep. Now that she saw Ranran, she knew she couldn’t hide it any longer, so she finally made up her mind to tell her daughter the truth about her parentage.</p>
<p>“Ranran, actually… you’re not our biological child…” After saying this, Qiaolian held her breath, waiting for her daughter’s reaction.</p>
<p>But Ranran only blinked and breathed a sigh of relief, “Is this what’s been bothering Mother? I’ve known for a long time, Mother found me on Jue Mountain.”</p>
<p>This time, it was the carpenter and Qiaolian who looked at each other in shock.</p>
<p>“You… knew for a long time? How is that possible? Who told you?”</p>
<p>Ranran smiled, “Mother, when I was six, you were talking to Grandma, and I was lying down resting. But I was actually awake, so I heard everything you two said.”</p>
<p>At that time, she was sick very often, and their family spent too much money on her treatment. The grandmother who knew about Ranran’s background couldn’t bear to see her daughter and son-in-law living in hardship, so she suggested they sell Ranran.</p>
<p>It wasn’t uncommon for poor families to sell their children, especially an adopted child like Ranran who was picked up.</p>
<p>But Qiaolian refused outright. She went back into the house, wrapped Ranran in a blanket and hurried back home that night.</p>
<p>Qiulian was stunned after listening to her daughter’s soft-spoken narration. She vaguely remembered this incident her daughter mentioned; at that time, Ranran was only six years old then. She actually knew everything in her heart!</p>
<p>Thinking back to Ranran’s behavior afterward, she did seem to lose some of her playful nature. Although her health was poor, she always tried her best to help with laundry, fetching water, and cooking… Also, whenever she went to seek medical advice, Ranran would always cry and refuse to take medicine as she did not like it,  and forbade her to spend money on medicines. At that time, Qiaolian thought the child disliked the bitterness of medicine… Who would have thought it was for this reason…</p>
<p>Qiaolian’s heart felt a pang, and she started crying again.</p>
<p>Was this child so sensible because she was afraid her parents wouldn’t want her anymore? She was so young at that time, hearing such words must have caused her a lot of confusion and fear!</p>
<p>Seeing her mother crying again, Ranran quickly wiped her tears and said, “I was small at that time and didn’t dare to tell Mother that I knew, but later I felt there was no need to say it. After all, I was too weak, even Grandmother Huang next door said that girls like me wouldn’t fetch much money, and would not improve our family’s situation.”</p>
<p>At that time, Ranran actually even had the idea of selling herself to help the family’s finances. She even specifically asked Grandmother Huang next door, who had relatives in the county town who were brokers and knew the slave market well.</p>
<p>But Grandmother Huang, seeing how frail-looking Ranran was, told her that someone like her would end up costing more in medical and funeral expenses and probably nobody would buy her.</p>
<p>That’s when Ranran gave up on the idea and started helping her mother with household chores in earnest.</p>
<p>However, neither of them mentioned Ranran’s parentage again; why did Qiaolian bring it up again now?</p>
<p>In fact, Qiaolian didn’t want to either. But just half a month ago, her family suddenly came looking for her, saying that officials were asking about the person who helped Ranran get registered.</p>
<p>Furthermore, her family said there were wealthy people looking for their lost child. If they found the adoptive family, they would be rewarded with a hundred gold pieces.</p>
<p>Such compensation could buy the whole village! Who wouldn’t be tempted by that? They even wished their own flesh and blood was adopted.</p>
<p>Qiaolian’s family members were excited by the news and went to the government office, claiming that their daughter had adopted a child back then. So the officials went to Juefeng Village. Fortunately, Qiaolian had left in a hurry and hadn’t had time to inform her family, so they hadn’t tracked her down to this place yet.</p>
<p>But Xue Liangui, when he went to the county to take on carpentry work a few days ago, accidentally met some old acquaintances who told him about these matters. He was so fearful and told them not to mention encountering them here. He then returned and told Qiaolian.</p>
<p>But it turns out that person couldn’t keep a secret, and Qiaolian’s family came looking for her first.</p>
<p>The people who came to find the child this time were officials, different from the intimidating ones in black robes before; this indicated that Ranran might really be from a wealthy family.</p>
<p>Now that they were willing to offer a hundred gold pieces to acknowledge her, if they still didn’t come forward to let her get acknowledged, wouldn’t it mean that Ranran would continue to stay in their poor family for the rest of her days?</p>
<p>As Xue Liangui had said, even if Ranran became a successful cultivator in the future, when she came down from the mountain, she might only be able to marry a craftsman or farmer.</p>
<p>Qiaolian thought long and hard about it and even though she didn’t want to, she felt that now that the child was grown, she should inform Ranran about this matter and let her decide whether to acknowledge her birth parents.</p>
<p>After listening quietly to her parents’ story, Ranran shook her head without any hesitation. “Mother, I only have you and Dad as parents. No matter who comes, I won’t acknowledge them.”</p>
<p>After hearing her daughter’s words, Qiaolian felt that her years of love had not been in vain. She hugged her daughter, and mother and daughter both burst into tears again, causing Carpenter Xue’s eyes to redden as well.</p>
<p>When Ranran walked out of the courtyard, she raised her head and saw her master standing not far away under the lush tree at the street corner.</p>
<p>It was already Spring, and the tree was full of intoxicating pear blossoms. The snow-white flowers complemented the tall man under the tree, to exude an exceptional otherworldly aura.</p>
<p>The gentle breeze stirred his robes, and causes one’s gaze to also linger on him, reluctant to look away…</p>
<p>Su Yishui was feeding a cat sitting on the wall with a biscuit he brought from the Xue family. When he saw Ranran coming, he stood up and walked towards her.</p>
<p>He noticed Ranran’s slightly reddened eyes as if she had just cried, but he did not ask about it. Instead, after walking for a while, he spoke, “Tomorrow, I will arrange for Yu Chen to escort your parents out of town. Your fourteenth Uncle Master has properties elsewhere, and they will be well taken care of there.”</p>
<p>Ranran did not expect Shifu to want to send her parents away. She couldn’t help but ask in a surprised tone, “Why?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui turned to look at her and said mildly, “The people who came looking for you are definitely not your parents; they likely have ulterior motives. You need to hurry and send your parents away before they find their way here, or it could become unpredictably dangerous. You’ll end up crying again.”</p>
<p>Ranran wasn’t surprised that her master overheard her conversation with her parents. The walls, for someone with true cultivation, were not a barrier.</p>
<p>But why was Shifu so sure that the people offering the reward of a hundred gold pieces wasn’t her parents?</p>
<p>When she tried to ask Su Yishui again, he quickened his pace and didn’t seem eager to answer, which made Ranran feel frustrated. Her master was deliberately keeping her in suspense… how annoying!</p>
<p>Suddenly, a thought flashed through Ranran’s mind. She looked at Su Yishui strangely, then asked hesitatingly, “Shifu, Second Uncle Master said that in order to let Elder Mu be reborn, you had gone to Jue Mountain several times. And Jue Mountain is inaccessible to ordinary people, yet I was coincidentally found on Jue Mountain by my mother… You’re so handsome and outstanding, you must have many female admirers. Did you perhaps have a… relationship with a female cultivator back then and… had a child…?”</p>
<p>What Ranran really wanted to ask was, “Am I… your daughter?”</p>
<p>Inspired by Third senior sister’s fictional stories about the relationships and grudges among cultivator families, Ranran couldn’t help but think, maybe her master was so certain about her parentage because he knew early on that she had been abandoned there?</p>
<p>Thinking back on her master’s usual tough love for her, wasn’t that the very manner of a father? Did he secretly fall in love with a female cultivator back then, gave birth to her, but sadly couldn’t publicly acknowledge it, so he left her on Jue Mountain until her parents brought her back home?</p>
<p>Su Yishui seemed completely unprepared for a question like this. The expression on Shifu’s face, usually of a kindly father, turned less kindly.</p>
<p>He stared at her coldly for a moment, unable to speak for a long while, before finally squeezing out from between his teeth, “Listen carefully, I’m not your father!”</p>
<p>Ranran, seeing Su Yishui’s manner, felt that he was not lying, and she couldn’t help but exhale slowly. Although it would have been nice if Su Yishui were her biological father, somehow that would have felt quite odd.</p>
<p>Without the bonds of familial ties, the master and disciple can get along as usual.</p>
<p>However, it was clear that her master knew something about her parentage. He never once said anything pointless to trouble others. Although Ranran had told the Xue couple she wouldn’t acknowledge her real family, knowing the truth would help her handle the situation better.</p>
<p>Su Yishui, after being bombarded by her many indirect questions for a good while, unhurriedly stated that since he was certain that the people looking for the abandoned infant had malicious intentions, they needed to make arrangements as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The way to get the Xue couple to leave was quite simple. Ranran would just tell them that her Uncle Master had a well-paying job taking care of a place, earning fifty taels of silver annually. They would oversee things there, just supervising some workers, not as demanding compared to running a breakfast stall.</p>
<p>The Xue couple naturally liked such a monthly income. Ranran also tactfully reminded her parents not to contact their maternal grandmother for the time being.</p>
<p>The gold reward offered was too substantial. If one of the uncles on the maternal side accidentally said too much, it could lead to trouble. A family capable of offering a hundred taels of gold wouldn’t have had to abandon a newborn on a mountain.</p>
<p>There had to be more to this than meets the eye. There were plenty of stories in plays about treacherous officials hunting down orphaned heirs. If someone wanted to harm her, wouldn’t it endanger the whole family.</p>
<p>Before Ranran mentioned it, Qiaolian hadn’t thought about this possibility. Her daughter’s analysis made her break out in a cold sweat.</p>
<p>After carefully instructing her daughter to take care of herself on the mountain, the Xue couple quickly packed their things in the night and left with Yu Chen for Zeng Yi’s Linyang property.</p>
<p>However, they didn’t cancel the lease on the rented courtyard. Su Yishui said they needed it to draw out the enemy and see who was looking for Ranran.</p>
<p>So Yuchen and Yutong applied yellowish ointment to their faces, added some wrinkles, wore fake beards and wigs with streaks of white. They disguised themselves as the Xue couple and temporarily stayed in the courtyard.</p>
<p>However, Su Yishui seemed to have been upset by Ranran’s impulsive acknowledgment of kinship. After returning to Xishan, he didn’t speak to her for an entire day.</p>
<p>Later, it was only after Ranran specially made his favorite dish, Longjing Sweet Shrimp, did Su Yishui finally ease that icy expression on his face.</p>
<p>Ranran felt that, it was a misconception on her part, to misunderstand that her master could have had a child before.</p>
<p>If they set aside Shifu’s extraordinary abilities and otherworldly appearance, his volatile temperament would not have been attractive to girls.</p>
<p>After spending a long time with Su Yishui, Ranran slowly understood the true essence behind Elder Mu’s compilation of the chapter on Fierce Beasts – sometimes Shifu got angry for inexplicable reasons, making it difficult to figure out his likes and dislikes.</p>
<p>When he talked to her, he also would not reveal everything at once, like a beef tendon that one just can’t chew on…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>YuChen and Yutong couldn’t handle the breakfast business like the Xue couple did, so they simply hung a notice in front of the stall, claiming they were unwell and would be closed for a few days.</p>
<p>The siblings spent their time in the courtyard, eating and drinking, waiting patiently for someone to knock on their door.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long before someone actually showed up. After two days, some people claiming to be officials from the state office, with stern faces accusing the Xue couple of kidnapping a child and demanding that they hand over their daughter.</p>
<p>Sharp-eyed Yutong, immediately noticed that the people with the officials were cultivators. After exchanging a few pleasantries, Su Yishui suddenly appeared, striking acupoints on these people and casting a Truth-telling spell. He quickly found out that they were sent by the War Goddess from the palace to search for someone.</p>

<p>When Su Yishui learned that Mu Qingge was the one who had sent them, he didn’t make things difficult for these people and simply had Yutong release them.</p>
<p>If it were someone else inquiring about the whereabouts of the spirit fruit, he might have to spend some effort.</p>
<p>But if it was this imposter, she would probably be even more meticulous than he was, fearful that someone might leak the traces of the real one and expose her true colors.</p>
<p>So, for that month, the pills that were supposed to be delivered on time to the palace to suppress the grudge water poison were “accidentally forgotten” by Immortal Su.</p>
<p>In the Western Palace, Mu Ranwu who was unable to suppress the grudge water inside her, screamed such painful cries that scared the palace maids and eunuchs away.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until she received a wooden box sent by Wen Hongshan that she finally breathed a sigh of relief. She wrote a letter, and sent them along to Su Yishui, acknowledged her mistake and stated that she had already found out about the two Spirit fruits. The one that fell to the ground first must be her younger sister. Worried about her younger sister, so she sent people to search for her.</p>
<p>And inside that wooden box was the key to the Netherworld Realm that Wen Hongshan had obtained from Wei Jiu.</p>
<p>Wen Hongshan still followed her plan in the end. She went to persuade Wei Jiu, negotiated terms with him, and exchanged them for the key to the Netherworld Realm.</p>
<p>Su Yishui picked up the piece of Ebony wooden key from the wooden box, turned it over, and looked at it against the sunlight. Although the square key was intricately carved with patterns, when aligned correctly, a faint and unclear inscription could be seen on the side – “Shui’er.”</p>
<p>It seemed that this key was indeed the one he had given to Wei Jiu. Otherwise, it would have been difficult for anyone to discover this inscription for replication.</p>
<p>Only one person called him that way in the entire world. Every time she called him, it seemed like there was a bubble of water in her mouth, rippling on her tongue… The look in those eyes was like a smile yet not quite…</p>
<p>“Shui’er…”</p>
<p>He put down the wooden plaque, plucked at the strings of the ancient zither on the side, lost in thought. Again, he heard the soft, sweet, and bright voice. He looked up abruptly at the young girl teasing him.</p>
<p>Ranran was wearing a plain white robe, her hair tied up in two buns, frowning as she held a small purple clay teapot in her hand, pouting and saying, “*This water has been mixed too sweet. I clearly told senior brother not to put too much melon juice. Looks like next time, I’ll have to do it myself…”<br/>*<em>its common for people to add 儿 to subject matter, in this case, Ranran put </em>儿<em> behind ‘water’, which became similar to how her Shifu had been called by Mu Qingge</em></p>
<p>Ranran had meditation exercises today, so Qiu Xier and Second Uncle Master went shopping. Therefore, lunch preparation was left to Senior brother. Since it was hot, a cup of sweet drink was refreshing, so after meditating for a while, she secretly drank a sip from the pot of sweet drink that senior brother had brought.</p>
<p>But the melon tea in this pot is really too overly sweet.</p>
<p>Just as she finished complaining, she saw Shifu, who was sitting in the main seat of the grassy hall and tuning the strings of the zither, looking over at her with deep and intense eyes.</p>
<p>Ranran quickly sat upright, thought for a moment, and then eagerly held up the pot, asking Shifu if he wanted some too.</p>
<p>Ever since she discovered all the errors in the Fierce Beasts chapter, she had conscientiously corrected a few, one of which was that Shifu loved to eat sweets.</p>
<p>The small sugar biscuits she made would usually be all eaten by her Shifu every time, and sometimes she wouldn’t even manage to grab one for herself. Maybe Shifu would also love this overly sweet pot of tea.</p>
<p>After hearing his disciple’s words of complaint, Su Yishui regained his composure, put the zither into its bag and picked it up, saying to her, “Today’s exercises are done. I’ll take you to drink something  that is not sweet.”</p>
<p>Ranran got up and followed her Master outside, feeling very excited. She tilted her head and asked, “Shifu, are we going to drink the jar of wine left by Elder Mu?”</p>
<p>Seeing Su Yishui nod his head, Ranran grabbed her skirt and rushed to the kitchen. She grabbed some fried peanuts she had made, along with some dried fish, and chased after her Shifu to taste the fine wine together.</p>
<p>Su Yishui took Ranran to the waterfall cave behind the mountain, where he fetched the dusty aged wine.</p>
<p>When he broke the seal, a tantalizing aroma filled the air. Ranran sniffed it, suddenly understanding the meaning of “Detain Celestial Immortal.” The taste of this aged wine was truly incomparable to any wine matured with spiritual talismans.</p>
<p>She eagerly took out the pair of small ceramic wine cups she had brought, along with the peanuts and dried fish wrapped in oil paper, intending to let Shifu have the first taste.</p>
<p>However, after Su Yishui took the wine cup, he brought it to her lips instead.</p>
<p>Ranran felt a little embarrassed but couldn’t resist the enticing aroma of the wine. So she quickly took a small sip, finding it indeed rich and full-bodied, with a strong aftertaste that prompted her to quickly eat two peanuts to offset it.</p>
<p>And so, the Master and disciple sat on a large stone by the waterfall, each with a cup, drinking like this.</p>
<p>Wine relaxes people, and after a few cups, the usual respectful and strict atmosphere between master and disciple seemed to loosen up.</p>
<p>Boosted by the wine, Ranran curiously asked the question she had always wanted to ask her Master, “Shifu, people say that you hate Elder Mu. Is that true?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui had a few cups of wine. He sat, with his usually tight collar slightly loosened, his long legs resting on the large stone, and his half-tied long hair flowing behind him, oozing with a lazy attitude. Upon hearing Ranran’s question, he raised his wine cup and suddenly smiled like a river thawing in spring, “Why don’t you ask, everyone says that Mu Qingge is absolutely infatuated with me, is that true?”</p>
<p>Ranran looked at Su Yishui’s unusual lazy demeanor compared with his usual coldness, his lips slightly curved in a smile, he actually looked a little more wicked than the demonic cultivator Wei Jiu…</p>
<p>While she was in a daze, Su Yishui suddenly leaned closer to her. His face no longer smiling, he asked coldly, “Tell me, do you think Mu Qingge is infatuated with me?”</p>
<p>Ranran unconsciously leaned back, her head hitting the large stone behind her. She tried to avoid her Master’s nose and whispered, “Elder Mu always comes to see you on her own initiative and talks to you. Naturally, she must have some attachment to you…”</p>
<p>But Su Yishui wasn’t satisfied. He seemed unwilling to back away, just focused on looking into her eyes. In his eyes, filled with a drunken haze, there was actually a hint of wicked cynicism “”Some women, she would look at you like how I’m looking at you, smiling at you, saying you’re the best looking. You say that’s infatuation… Actually, it’s all just rubbish!”</p>
<p>His mouth curved into a smile, his eyes fixed on her, but there was no laughter in them, only an indescribable desolation and something else that she couldn’t understand..</p>
<p>Ranran felt a bit panicked, feeling that something was off with this atmosphere. Was her Master warning her not to be deceived by sweet words and affectionate gazes, and be cheated of her feelings in the future?</p>
<p>In her confusion, she grabbed the zither her Master had brought and placed it between them, and said ingratiatingly, “Shifu, it’s been a while since I heard you play the zither. Would you mind playing a tune while we’re in high spirits?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui finally sat up straight, poured another cup of wine and downed it in one go. He then took the zither, crossed his legs, and set up the instrument. He remained silent for a while, slowly plucking the strings. The melodious music flowed like a stream, filling the valley.</p>
<p>Ranran found Shifu’s zither skills irresistible, even more intoxicating than the wine.</p>
<p>Listening to the flowing music, she forgot the awkwardness from earlier and casually half removed her embroidered shoes by the cliff, her slender toes hooking onto the shoes as she swayed them to and fro. Eventually, she couldn’t help but hum along with the music.</p>
<p>Although there were no lyrics but the clear voice echoed in the ravine, the waterfall splashed down like broken jade and flowers bloomed on the cliff. A breeze blew, brushing the lively girl’s cheek and hair. In a trance, her carefree smile seemed to overlap with the portrait of the red-clothed woman in the hall…</p>
<p>Su Yishui silently watched his intoxicated disciple, finally stopping the music. He picked up the jar of wine, and took a gulp as he threw his head back. The strong aroma of the wine spread on his lips, teeth, and tongue.</p>
<p>The wine she brewed was just like her, initially too strong and made one uncomfortable, but once you thought you wanted to stop drinking, the flavor of the wine has already entered the throat, and became too hard to put down.</p>
<p>In a daze, he also couldn’t seem to figure out whether what made him intoxicated was the wine in the cup or the person in front of him…</p>
<p>As Ranran was singing happily, her smile still on her face when she saw her handsome Shifu suddenly falling straight down, making a splash as he fell into the deep pool below the cliff…</p>
<p>Afterwards, Ranran was filled with self-blame. If she had known earlier that her Shifu was actually so easily intoxicated, she would have definitely stopped him from drinking.</p>
<p>Elder Mu’s compilation of the Fierce Beasts Chapter was truly full of illogical rubbish, why did she record a whole bunch of mistakes but left out that Su Yishui was a lightweight drinker? </p>
<p>Ranran was very thankful that she had learned how to swim in time. After her drunken Shifu fell into the deep pool, she managed to fish him out by herself.</p>
<p>Of course, the wretched state during that time cannot be described. Ranran even had to press her Shifu’s stomach to squeeze out the water he had choked on, then blew into his mouth to help him resume breathing.</p>
<p>But her Shifu seemed dead, without any breath at all. Ranran stood there in a panic, mouth slightly agape, tears streaming down… She never expected that killing her Shifu would be so simple.</p>
<p>She was at her wit’s end and could only get up to search for someone else.</p>
<p>But as she left, Su Yishui who had been lying on the ground finally half-opened his eyes. He turned his head to look at Ranran’s back as she hurried away, and reached out to touch his lips. Just now it felt as if there were petals with a fragrant wine scent, had fallen on his lips, so soft and sweet…</p>
<p>Following that, Ranran ran to the front hall but couldn’t find anyone. When she returned to the cave again, she found that her Shifu had taken off his wet outer clothes and was sitting on the large stone by the river wringing his clothes.</p>
<p>Ranran breathed a sigh of relief, chanted “Amitabha Buddha,” and then cautiously asked, “Shifu, do you want to drink some hangover soup…”</p>
<p>Su Yishui glanced at her, touched the water on his face, then tossed out “If you dare to mention how I got drunk to others, will be punished according to the rules of the sect,” and left dripping wet.</p>
<p>Ranran carried the remaining half-jar of aged wine and gloomily returned to her room.</p>
<p>If her Shifu was so easily intoxicated, he really had no common interests with his previous Master. It’s no wonder Mu Qingge, despite having many outstanding disciples, had to go to Cuiwei Mountain to find Elder Jiu to enjoy a drink.</p>
<p>However, she was also slow to realize, as she recalled touching Shifu’s lips with her own to save him, she suddenly felt her heart beating too fast. Finally, she took a Clear Heart Pill and quickly meditated to control her emotions.</p>
<p>Desire is the devil in one’s heart, she must be vigilant at all times. Perhaps this is also a test of her cultivation level by her Shifu! She must remain in control.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After a month, the Heavenly Tribulation finally arrived in the mountains and rivers as scheduled, with heavenly thunder rolling everywhere.</p>
<p>Things remained relatively quiet in the Western Mountains. After Su Yishui had contributed his cultivation in the past, he had yet to fully recover. Even after absorbing Wei Jiu’s cultivation, it was only restored by half.</p>
<p>The methods of dealing with the Heavenly Tribulation varied among the experts, but most required highly cultivated disciples to assist.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge hid in the imperial palace and couldn’t be used. In recent years, there were no outstanding disciples among the three major sects. So in the final test, among the high level masters of the three major sects, Abess Wen from the Kongshan Sect was actually struck to death by lightning, while the others didn’t have enough cultivation and were fortunate to escape heavy punishment by the Heavens.</p>
<p>After this, replenishing new blood became of the utmost importance. Without cultivating capable disciples, they would not pass the next Heavenly Punishment.</p>
<p>Therefore, after the Heavenly Tribulation, Shifu received an invitation to the Marrow-Cleansing Pool Meet jointly issued by the three major sects.</p>
<p>This Marrow Cleansing Pool Meet could be said to be a very important gathering for the younger generation of cultivators.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, the Marrow Cleansing Pool is used to wash away worldly impurities and refine one’s essence. Located in *Tian Mai Mountain, it is said to be the place where ancient cultivator Dun Tian had sat in meditation before ascending.<br/>*<em>Tian Mai literally is Sky’s Vein</em></p>
<p>Tired of immortal longevity, he voluntarily turned into mountains, his eyes turned into pools. For cultivators, these pools has the function of cleansing and reshaping their foundation.</p>
<p>It is most effective, especially for those who have just built their foundation or have reached intermediate levels in their cultivation.</p>
<p>For disciples of the immortal cultivation righteous faction, they cannot rely on evil things like the Netherworld Spirit Spring, so they can only hope for the opportunity when the Marrow Cleansing Pool opens once every ten years.</p>
<p>Whenever the Marrow Cleansing Pool opens, Tianmai Mountain would shake and erupt with molten lava. After the lava solidifies, a blue pool would appear at the mouth of the mountain. Meditating in the pool allows for rapid cultivation progress.</p>
<p>However, if too many people enter the pool, it inevitably dilutes the spiritual power. So the righteous sects came up with a fair compromise, sending their most capable disciples to compete fairly.</p>
<p>The spiritual power of the Marrow Cleansing Pool is precious, and each person can only enter once. How could it be given to ordinary mortals? Naturally, only the outstanding younger generation disciples can seize this opportunity to advance their cultivation.</p>
<p>Although this rule may look fair, it actually blocks the possibility of disciples from other small sects of entering the pool. After all, everyone knows that the threshold of the three major sects is difficult to cross, and the promising young cultivators have already been picked up by the three major sects.</p>
<p>So the Sect Leaders and great cultivators of the three major sects have all practiced in the Marrow Cleansing Pool before. In the past few hundred years, unless they had outstanding talent, disciples from other minor sects would find it very difficult to get such opportunities.</p>
<p>This kind of elite selection, does not seem like something that the few inept XiShan disciples can participate in.</p>
<p>Therefore, when Second Uncle Master read the invitation to the Marrow Cleansing Pool Meet, Qiu Xier just nodded with envy, while Ranran curiously asked about the famous local delicacies and specialties near Tianmai Mountain.</p>
<p>Gao Cang shook his head sadly, “Unfortunately, we haven’t been in the Sect long enough to compete with the disciples of the three major sects. Otherwise, we would definitely be do our best to make Shifu proud of us!”</p>
<p>However, Su Yishui calmly said, “Such opportunities are rare, and you all naturally have to strive for them. Since you have received the invitation, you must go.”</p>
<p>Ranran widened her eyes and asked Second Uncle Master beside her, “Are the trials at the Marrow Cleansing Pool Meet difficult?”</p>
<p>Second Uncle Master thought for a moment and said, “I haven’t been to Tianmai Mountain, but it is said that in the past three hundred years, the Marrow Cleansing Pool Meet has been monopolized by the three major sects. There was only two times when disciples from other sects took the lead and entered the pool.”</p>
<p>Gao Cang, upon hearing this, immediately asked eagerly, “Who were they?”</p>
<p>Yu Tong, feeling proud, said, “One was naturally my Master, and the other… was Mu Qingge from back then.”</p>
<p>Ranran nodded admiringly. XiShan unexpectedly had such potential. In just a few decades, they produced two outstanding talents like the dragon and the phoenix. </p>
<p>Mu Qingge and Su Yishui were both geniuses rarely seen in a hundred years, and not something small fries like them could compare to. If they were to go to Tianmai Mountain, they would probably not be able to make their Master proud, but it would be good to go out and have some fun.</p>
<p>However, Qiu Xier and Gao Cang obviously didn’t think so. As they say, with Great masters come great disciples, and who knows, maybe another genius will emerge from XiShan this year.</p>
<p>So they begged Ranran to make them two pairs of “*Guaranteed Success” insoles, hoping to bring them some luck and achieve a good ranking.<br/>*逢考必过 <em>To Pass Every Test</em></p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>These days, Ranran’s alchemy furnace had been burning nonstop. After returning from Cha Ming Mountain, her Master had her start refining Marrow-strengthening pills.</p>
<p>However, these pills were not for humans but for spirit beasts. They could help enhance the power of spirit beasts, especially those who had suffered injuries from many years ago.</p>
<p>Ranran knew that this was for the little tiger. It was said the battle at Jue Mountain had been very devastating. In a critical moment, the Gengjin White Tiger prepared to sacrifice itself to save Mu Qingge.</p>
<p>But Mu Qingge couldn’t bear to let her beloved spirit beast perish with her, so at that moment, she knocked it off Jue Mountain.</p>
<p>After that battle, the White Tiger’s spiritual power was greatly depleted. Although Su Yishui had treated it with divine herb like Lingzhi, the benefits were limited.</p>
<p>The reason it mostly took the form of a cat was actually due to its inability to sustain its spiritual power, and  was its way to conserve energy.</p>
<p>The efficacy of the Marrow-strengthening Pill was very beneficial for treating the White Tiger’s injuries. If Ranran could refine them successfully, perhaps the White Tiger’s recovery progress could be faster.</p>
<p>Because most of the time, the White Tiger was always like a drowsy cat, especially after its great display of power on the Wangxiang river the last time, it was always off somewhere sleeping. Su Yishui hoped the White Tiger would become more energetic.</p>
<p>However, Ranran’s progress this time was not quite smooth.</p>
<p>In addition to precise proportions in the formula and mastering the fire levels of the furnace, Pill alchemy also required the willpower of the alchemist to empower the furnace.</p>
<p>Of course, the better the alchemy furnace, the better it can accept spiritual force, allowing all potentials to be fully materilized.</p>
<p>Ranran was using the alchemy furnace that Elder Mu had used before, which was of course great, but when refining higher-level pills, she would always seem just one step away from success.</p>
<p>Puzzled, she asked her Shifu if there was something she didn’t do well enough.</p>
<p>Su Yishui explained, “Anyone can refine lower-level pills, but for higher-level pills, the alchemist’s cultivation level also comes into play to empower the process. So those who practice alchemy must constantly improve their internal energy. Many alchemists cannot advance in alchemy skills, because their spiritual power is not increasing.”</p>
<p>Because her spiritual power was not enough, Su Yishui led Ranran in refining the final batch of pills together.</p>
<p>Before they started refining, Su Yishui told her that after the furnace was opened, he would have to go into seclusion again, so he couldn’t accompany her on the Tianmai Mountain trip.</p>
<p>After she was injured last time, her Shifu  would keep an eye on her wherever she went. This time, Shifu was actually willing to let go, and allow her to go with her Master Uncles, which made Ranran extremely happy.</p>
<p>So after the pills were refined, Ranran did not see her Shifu Su Yishui again.</p>
<p>And it was obvious that Ranran’s pills this time was another failure. After the little tiger reluctantly ate one, it snarled at Ranran with a grimace as if dissatisfied with its taste.</p>
<p>Its size remained unchanged, and it seemed even lazier than before, often snuggling into Ranran’s arms and dozing off for days.</p>
<p>So when they went off to Tianmai Mountain, they had to bring this lazy tiger along.</p>
<p>Ranran herself didn’t hold out much hope for this Marrow Cleansing Pool Meet. This gathering was more of an opportunity for  disciples of the major sects to make a breakthrough.</p>
<p>The odds for XiShan to get a chance was very negligible, so there was no need to hold high expectations.</p>
<p>They were going just to represent their Sect and maintain appearances.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>However, before they arrived at Tianmai Mountain, the lackadaisical disciples from XiShan finally felt the unyielding determination from the disciples of other sects.</p>
<p>When they were still some distance from Tianmai Mountain, the roads were already filled with carriages and horses from various major sects.</p>
<p>Of course, there were also high level guards from the major sects. It was said that in the past hundred years, except for Mu Qingge, no demonic cultivators could get close to Tianmai Mountain. This was a consensus among all the righteous immortal sects; they couldn’t let the demonic path grow another demonic seed again.</p>
<p>When Ranran’s carriage was waiting for identity verification, it was at the back of the queue. In the time she took to peer out, she actually saw second senior brother Bai Baishan.</p>
<p>Bai Bashan had been sent by Uncle Master Zeng to deliver the protective soft silver armor to Ranran.</p>
<p>Seeing this grand scene of the long queues, Bai Baishan, who had lost his foundation, felt envious and somewhat despondent.</p>
<p>At the entrance of Tianmai Mountain, there was a <em>Decline Visitors Stone</em> ( Xie Ke Stone ).<br/>*谢客 most likely from 闭门谢客</p>
<p>This was an entrance to a mountain valley, with a narrow passage in the middle flanked by a flat stone similar to a gate. To pass through, one had to use spiritual power to lift the flat stone upwards. If one’s spiritual power was insufficient, then they couldn’t enter the mountain gate.</p>
<p>When Gao Cang and the others finally verified their identities and arrived, there was already another long queue here.</p>
<p>Gao Cang was impatient, so he took them to the front to take a look. They saw that the flat stone was extremely heavy, even lifting it with their arms required a lot of effort, let alone using spiritual power. How could they lift it?</p>
<p>At this moment, there was a burly man with the same idea as Gao Cang, who was about to challenge the stone gate. He said in a bold manner, “Who set a rule to say we can only use spiritual power to pass? I’ll just go around here!”</p>
<p>With that, he leaped up, trying to jump over the flat stone. But just as he reached the top of the flat stone, a thunderbolt flashed, followed by a crack, and he was suddenly knocked down to the ground.</p>
<p>The female disciples of the KongShan Sect, who were waiting leisurely by the side, couldn’t help but burst into laughter. “The Marrow Cleansing Pool is a sacred place left by the Ancient Cultivator Dun Tian, how can it be defiled by mediocrity? The entire Tianmai Mountain is shrouded in the spiritual shield he left behind. Only on the day of the Marrow Cleansing Pool Meet, can one pass through this trial stone gate. What an idiot, trying to jump over the gate!”</p>
<p>The man who was knocked down by the thunderbolt was quite sturdy. After staggering for a while, he climbed up again, glaring over, but sat cross-legged in front of the stone gate, trying to concentrate his qi and spiritual power. However, the stone gate only moved slightly and then remained motionless.</p>
<p>And so derisive laughter arose again. Unable to bear the embarrassment, the man jumped up again, preparing to use his hands to lift the trial stone.</p>
<p>But as soon as his hands touched the stone, a bright lightning bolt struck him directly.</p>
<p>This time, after he screamed and fell to the ground and twitched for a while, he then lay motionless.</p>

<p>Second Uncle Master watched the man lying limp on the side, sighed, and said, “His tendons and bones have been shattered, he’s completely disabled…”</p>
<p>The four young ones exchanged looks, they had no idea that this first hurdle would be so sinister. The stone couldn’t even be touched, it was truly terrifying.</p>
<p>However, as more and more people arrived at the Stone Gate, Ranran soon discovered that the man’s experience was actually considered fortunate.</p>
<p>Most people who took up the challenge, just managed to slightly move the trial stone, but they also didn’t dare to touch it or do anything against the rules, so they had to leave disappointed.</p>
<p>Finally, it was JiuHua Sect’s turn. The first one to step forward wasn’t the Chief Disciple Wei Fang, but a chubby-looking fellow who seemed quite pleased with himself. From their earlier discussions, this disciple named Guo was said to be the fastest rising star in recent years, second only to Wei Fang.</p>
<p>Among the junior disciples of Jiuhua Sect who had hopes of entering the marrow-cleansing pool, besides Wei Fang, there was only this Disciple Guo.</p>
<p>After he sat down cross-legged and adjusted his breath, steam started rising from his head quickly, and the trial stone, which had been motionless, suddenly shook violently and then rose bit by bit.</p>
<p>Amid the astonished exclamations of the crowd, the chubby fellow proudly stood up and was about to pass under the stone.</p>
<p>But just then, perhaps because he didn’t control his breath well enough when he stood up, the massive Trial stone that had been raised suddenly collapsed with a thunderous crash, hitting the man who had walked under it on the head…</p>
<p>Qiu Xier and Ranran had queued up. They greeted those in front and behind them to reserve their queue position, then ran under a nearby tree to sit down and eat their own packed lunch.</p>
<p>From here, they were completely caught off guard and saw the bloody scene of carnage. Qiu Xier screamed in fright and jumped into Gao Cang’s arms.</p>
<p>Second senior brother was trying to feed himself with chopsticks held between his toes, and the scare made him bite his big toe instead.</p>
<p>Ranran silently forced down the juicy fish balls in her mouth, then closed her eyes and held her breath, trying to forget the bloody scene as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This time, the new disciples of the three major sects were all silent, and no one made mocking remarks anymore.</p>
<p>Wei Fang seemed to have anticipated that something like this would happen and coldly said to the remaining junior disciples, “The marrow-cleansing pool is a blessing left by an ancient powerhouse. Those with weak blessings or unsteady wills cannot pass this threshold. Brother Guo did his best, but unfortunately, his cultivation was not enough, and his efforts ended in failure…”</p>
<p>As he said this, there was a hint of moisture in his eyes, and he wiped away the tears.</p>
<p>Originally, there were three more disciples from Jiuhua Sect who were going to challenge the trial, and their strength was not inferior to Brother Guo. However, with the remnants of their fellow disciple’s flesh and blood still under the stone, how could they concentrate their minds to lift the stone and pass the test?</p>
<p>It was possible that the next person to be smashed to pieces might be one of them.</p>
<p>So, although the remaining few disciples managed to lift the trial stone halfway, they hesitated and didn’t dare to pass, eventually exhausting their breath and returning in defeat.</p>
<p>At this moment, Qiu Xier was also very frightened and whispered to Ranran, “Oh my goodness, this trial here is actually more life-threatening than our Shifu’s. Even the outstanding disciples from Jiuhua Sect couldn’t pass. I guess we won’t even get close to it. Maybe we should go back early and not stay here anymore.”</p>
<p>But Ranran shook her head and frowned, looking at Wei Fang, who had tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>She thought for a moment and said, “I heard that Wei Fang has been here twice already, so he should have foreseen something like this. If he had been willing to advise the junior disciples that the critical moment should have been when the trial stone was lifted. Perhaps Brother Guo wouldn’t have had to sacrifice himself. But look, Wei Fang arranged the order for Jiuhua Sect to pass, but he let Brother Guo, who is equally capable as him, to go first and didn’t even give him any warning. From what I see, this trial stone is testing the wickedness of human hearts…”</p>
<p>Gao Cang and Qiu Xier hadn’t thought in this direction before, but after hearing Ranran’s analysis, they felt a sudden realization.</p>
<p>There can be only one who comes out on top in the Marrow-cleansing Pool Meet. Even if they are from the same sect, they will ultimately become competitors.</p>
<p>Wei Fang failed to pass last time, but this time he came with the determination to pass. In that case, how could he let the rising stars of the same sect pass the test?</p>
<p>As expected, the last person to challenge from Jiuhua Sect was Wei Fang. Although faced with the blood-soaked ground from his fellow sect member, Wei Fang remained unaffected, lifted the stone with his breath, and then passed through in a flash, as if he had been practicing diligently for a long time.</p>
<p>The only disciple from Jiuhua Sect who passed the trial was Wei Fang.</p>
<p>When it was Kongshan Sect’s turn, the situation wasn’t as tragic as Jiuhua Sect’s.</p>
<p>Because Abess Wen hadn’t been able to overcome the heavenly tribulation and had just passed away. The new leader of Kongshan Sect had not been officially decided yet, and the acting head was Abess Wen’s adopted daughter, Wen Hongshan.</p>
<p>Wen Hongshan had been to Tianmai Mountain before, but unfortunately, she hadn’t managed to beat Su Yishui for the chance to get into the marrow-cleansing pool back then.</p>
<p>The rule of Tianmai Mountain was that everyone could only come once in their lifetime. This meant that once they passed the trial stone, there was no chance for a second try.</p>
<p>Wen Hongshan had passed this first hurdle in the past, so after carefully instructing her disciples with the precautions, three people from their sect managed to pass.</p>
<p>Among these three, there were twin sisters named Wen Bingqing and Wen Yujie, said to be prodigies sought out by Abess Wen from the mortal world, who had already reached the Foundation Establishment of Fifth Heaven at a young age and were promising young talents.</p>
<p>The remaining person was a tall young man with a sun-browned face that no one knew much about. Apparently he was a relative of Wen Hongshan and had managed to join this Meet through her connection.</p>
<p>Although he had just joined the Kongshan sect, his strength was not to be underestimated. After meditating for a while, he also lifted the trial stone.</p>
<p>Thus, a day passed, and out of the long queue of hundreds of people, only about a dozen managed to pass.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The few timid ones from XiShan Sect didn’t compete and stayed under the shade of the trees, eating and drinking until the end. According to Qiu Xier, what’s the point of soaking in this pool?</p>
<p>Even if it’s comfortable, is it as comfortable as Master Uncle Zeng’s medicinal pool?</p>
<p>Just then, a long convoy suddenly appeared from halfway up the mountain, and Mu Qingge, who had been hiding in the palace and unseen by anyone, arrived gracefully.</p>
<p>Although she had lived two lives, for this new reborn body, had never been to Tianmai Mountain, so she was indeed eligible.</p>
<p>When she got off the carriage, the crowd that was about to disperse suddenly stopped. When they saw that she was also trying to compete for the opportunity to enter Tianmai Mountain, someone immediately complained, “Mu Qingge, you entered the Marrow-cleansing pool long ago. Aren’t you ashamed to compete for such an opportunity with the younger generation?”</p>
<p>Mu Qingge heard this but couldn’t be bothered to respond. She simply walked towards the trial stone, didn’t even meditate, and just waved her hand lightly, causing the massive stone to lift as lightly as a feather. After she walked past, the stone fell with a thunderous crash, in just the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>The stark contrast in power left all the proud young disciples who had previously passed the trial stone feeling speechless.</p>
<p>At this moment, Mu Qingge laughed softly and said, “I’ve lived twice, and this body has never entered the marrow-cleansing pool. Whether I’m qualified or not, the trial stone will be the judge. If anyone still feels aggrieved, there’s no rush; There are more challenges next, we can take it slowly.”</p>
<p>Turning her head, she looked at the XiShan disciples who were eating and drinking under the trees. After scanning them all, her gaze settled on Xue Ranran, who was biting into an apple.</p>
<p>The look in her eyes was complex. If it weren’t for the report from the person she had dispatched, Mu Qingge could never have imagined that the young disciple of Su Yishui she had encountered before was actually the fallen spirit fruit…</p>
<p>Su Yishui had recognized her very early on? He had actually kept her by his side since then. But this young girl had none of the bearing from her past life; in talent and appearance, she was nothing remarkable, much like Mu Ranwu who had faded into obscurity in her previous life…</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Mu Ranwu smiled. When she and her sister had perished together, she had used a soul-shifting technique to alter their destinies.</p>
<p>In her previous life, her sister was born under auspicious signs, her cultivation path smooth sailing, unlike Mu Ranwu who was born prematurely and had average aptitude, with nothing outstanding.</p>
<p>Now, they had truly and completely swapped their fated lot.</p>
<p>She wanted to see what accomplishments an average person could achieve, even if they had Su Yishui’s devoted affection?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, she stood on one side of the stone gate and smiled meaningfully at Xue Ranran, “Ranran, we meet again. Why hasn’t your XiShan sect passed this stone trial yet?”</p>
<p>Because she had sent someone to disturb her parents, Ranran’s liking for Elder Mu suddenly plummeted. So when Elder Mu spoke, she didn’t want to respond to her.</p>
<p>However, it was not early in the day, and the few of them really couldn’t delay any longer. If they couldn’t even pass the first test, XiShan Lingxi Palace’s dignity would really be lost.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Xue Ranran said to her fellow disciples beside her, “Let’s go, let’s give it a try.”</p>
<p>Bai Baishan looked melancholy and put on his shoes and socks, saying, “You guys go try. I have no true qi in my body right now, so I won’t go embarrass our XiShan sect.”</p>
<p>So the remaining three came up to the trial stone.</p>
<p>Gao Cang was the one with higher cultivation among the disciples. After adjusting his breath in a cross-legged position, he started to move the stone with his energy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the stone only moved slightly, but when it was Qiu Xier’s turn, it didn’t even budge.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge didn’t care about the performances of these two at all; she was focused on watching Xue Ranran.</p>
<p>Even though she felt that Xue Ranran was not a threat, Mu Ranwu was still a little worried. After being adopted by the carpenter couple from the Juefeng Village, how did Xue Ranran manage to survive after leaving the Rebirth Tree?</p>
<p>The Rebirth Tree had long been destroyed, so how did Xue Ranran seem to be getting more graceful and delicate? There was no trace of any congenital deficiency in her appearance now.</p>
<p>Thinking of how Su Yishui had withheld the detoxifying pills to punish her for investigating Xue Ranran’s parentage, causing her to suffer horribly for a whole month, her heart harbored an unresolved resentment.</p>
<p>Now, the one who looks like a heavenly immortal was her, the one who possesses innate spiritual power was also her! Why wouldn’t Su Yishui look properly at her and instead kept this worthless person with no golden core by his side?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, she took a deep breath, smiling as she loudly addressed Ranran, “Miss Xue, it’s your turn.”</p>
<p>Ranran stood in front of the trial stone for a moment, lost in thought until Mu Qingge called out to her. Then she walked over and sat down to gather her breath.</p>
<p>As expected, just like Qiu Xier, the stone didn’t budge at all.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu’s smile widened gradually, and her anxious heart slowly relaxed. Elder sister, as long as you don’t cause any trouble, living idle for a few decades isn’t too bad…</p>
<p>The others weren’t too surprised, seeing that the XiShan Sect didn’t amount to much. As they got ready to leave, Ranran turned to ask Second Master Uncle: “Is there a rule in passing the trial stone, that specifies only one person can go at a time?”</p>
<p>Yu Tong was also stumped by the question. Because the situation mentioned by Ranran had never occurred before.</p>
<p>After all, the temptation of the marrow-cleansing pool is no less than that of the Spirit Spring, which is a dream opportunity for many from the young generation of cultivators. How could there be anyone forming a group to pass the single-log bridge, since this was a matter that was to showcase individual strength?</p>
<p>Such a shameful and humiliating situation, other sects can neither come up with it nor do.</p>
<p>So Yu Tong honestly replied, “I don’t know either. But it seems there’s no such rule.” </p>
<p>Ranran turned back to Gao Cang and Qiu Xier, saying, “Do you remember the core meaning of our Demon Subduing Formation?”</p>
<p>Hearing her question, the three looked at each other and said in unison, “In the formation, we unite as one, advancing and retreating together, living and dying together!”</p>
<p>Ranran clapped her hands. “That’s right! Since the Demon Subduing Formation can combine our strengths, why don’t we set up a formation and see if we can lift the trial stone together?”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Gao Cang and Qiu Xier clapped their hands too. “Yes! Ranran, you’re so clever. Why didn’t we think of that?”</p>
<p>Although Ranran was the youngest, her adventures in Wangxiang River and Cha Ming Mountain had earned her respect and unassailable authority from her senior siblings.</p>
<p>The two of them just had to blindly follow whatever proposal Ranran suggested!</p>
<p>So amidst laughter and mockery from the other cultivators, three people squeezed at the trial stone in an unprecedented manner.</p>
<p>Then the three concentrated, following Ranran’s commands to lift the stone with their collective breath.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, three mediocre cobblers will surpass a Zhuge Liang, and the combined strength of three XiShan rookies shouldn’t be underestimated. The formation itself has a boosting factor to their strength, so although a single person couldn’t lift the stone, when the three of them coordinated, they managed to lift it.</p>
<p>Ranran pointed a finger to exert her power, then focused on her fellow disciples. “Hold steady and don’t lose heart. Use the Lotus Step to enter the gate step by step!”</p>
<p>Following Ranran’s words, the three stepped with the Lotus Step, moving like a rotating lotus flower, and flashed through the gate one by one.</p>
<p>Only after Ranran entered the gate last did the trial stone crash down, and the three XiShan disciples managed to pass the challenge together in this way.</p>
<p>Accompanied by the thunderous sound of the stone falling, the three young ones cheered and clapped, excitedly stomping their feet.</p>
<p>When Ranran made such a suggestion, the onlookers initially sneered in disdain, but gradually they became astonished and speechless.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu stared fixedly at the girl’s lively smile, feeling a sudden thump in her heart, which made her hold her breath for a long moment.</p>
<p>After the three passed the challenge, Wei Fang was the first to come to his senses, shouting loudly, “This doesn’t count! You three clearly cheated!”</p>
<p>With his shout, others also shouted, expressing that these three were not qualified to continue to the next challenge.</p>
<p>Ranran turned to look at them, puzzled. “Strange, are you all examiners? Clearly, the inscription on the monument next to the trial stone says ‘The stone bearer can pass,’ it didn’t say that each time only one person can lift the stone! We all passed, so we passed the challenge!”</p>
<p>Qiu Xier and Gao Cang also confidently said, “We, the brothers and sisters of XiShan are harmonious and willing to pass the challenge together. Unlike you all, who selfishly play tricks and watch inexperienced fellow disciples die without giving them any advice in advance!”</p>
<p>This statement clearly hinted at something, and everyone looked at Wei Fang. Wei Fang’s face tightened, and he rushed forward to reprimand Gao Cang.</p>
<p>Too bad the XiShan disciples practiced Monkey Arts, with extraordinary lightness in their steps. They skillfully dodged, leaping onto trees to avoid Wei Fang and even made faces at him.</p>
<p>Finally, Mu Qingge spoke up and mediated, “Enough, since they passed the trial stone, naturally, they have passed the challenge. There are more trials to the Water Amusement Pool; this was just the first one. True gold fears no fire; you all don’t need to be too impatient.”</p>
<p>Her words were diplomatic, resolving Ranran and their group’s situation, showing goodwill, and subtly indicating that they had only used some clever tricks and not real strength. Even if they passed this challenge, the remaining ones could probably eliminate them.</p>
<p>Everyone was eager to move on to the next challenge, so they couldn’t be bothered to argue with the XiShan disciples anymore. After all, the ones they truly feared were Wei Fang, Mu Qingge, and that unknown dark-faced boy from the KongShan Sect.</p>
<p>These were the ones with real power, the ones who posed a real threat!</p>
<p>With Ranran and her group setting an example, those who hadn’t passed before also tried to team up to lift the stone together. Their foundations were better than those of the XiShan disciples, but mastering such cooperative formations took more than just a few days, so their effort was not as effective as just one person lifting it.</p>
<p>Now, the remaining people were convinced. Although the XiShan disciples were considered mediocre, they had indeed relied on some hard-earned skills to lift the massive stone.</p>
<p>So the ten over people who passed the challenge no longer ganged up on them. After glaring at the three, they all went towards the next challenge.</p>
<p>The dark-faced boy from the KongShan Sect didn’t seem familiar with the other fellow disciples and didn’t walk with them but strolled leisurely behind alone.</p>
<p>As Ranran walked, she ended up walking next to him. The boy suddenly turned to look at her, his eyes somewhat dark and unfriendly.</p>
<p>Ranran was eating dried sweet potatoes. When she saw the boy staring at her, she thought he was hungry, so she handed him the snack bag, saying, “Here, if you want to eat, just help yourself!”</p>
<p>The boy was taken aback, looking at the bag of dried sweet potatoes she handed over. He seemed wary, as if afraid there might be a trap inside.</p>
<p>Seeing his caution, Ranran simply grabbed a handful and handed it to him, saying, “Eat it, I made them myself. You can’t buy dried sweet potatoes this sweet elsewhere.”</p>
<p>The dark-faced boy slowly reached out and took the dried sweet potatoes but didn’t eat them. Instead, he put them in his own pocket.</p>
<p>Taking the opportunity to start a conversation, Ranran asked, “May I ask for your name and your ranking in the KongShan Sect?”</p>
<p>The dark-faced boy finally smiled slightly, glanced at her inquisitively, and said in a low voice that seemed to pour out from his throat, indistinctly, “My surname is Gui, and my name is Baqian.”</p>
<p>It seemed that Brother Gui Baqian had just joined the KongShan Sect. To have such strength as a newly admitted disciple was why the other KongShan disciples didn’t seem to like him much, showing obvious signs of exclusion.</p>
<p>Ranran also felt some sympathy for Brother Gui Baqian, so she took the initiative to give him a handful of dried sweet potato.</p>
<p>Tianmai Mountain was quite majestic. Climbing mountains in the north could take two or three days, and Tianmai Mountain was known for its steep terrain. After passing the first checkpoint and climbing a short distance up the mountain, it gradually grew dark.</p>
<p>Most of the people who made it through the first trial had already started practicing a higher level of cultivation. So, fasting for a few days wasn’t a problem.</p>
<p>According to their respective sects, they each settled down in an empty space halfway up the mountain and waited for the next day to continue their ascent.</p>
<p>But in the darkness and silence of the mountain, the three from XiShan started a barbecue.</p>
<p>Wherever Ranran went, she would make clear preparations for the matter of eating well beforehand.</p>
<p>Chunks of chicken legs marinated and wrapped in pig stomach pouches filled with soup didn’t need to be unwrapped. Wrapped in wet mud and buried directly in charcoal, they soon emitted a fragrant aroma. Qiu Xier also had five-spice sesame cakes in her bag, a perfect complement to the chicken!</p>
<p>When it was time to eat, the little white tiger suddenly appeared. It seems like it had followed them along the way. Although Tianmai Mountain was picky about people who entered, there were no restrictions on birds and beasts.</p>
<p>Ranran picked a large leaf from a tree, washed it with water from her bag, and put some cooled meat on it for the little white tiger to eat.</p>
<p>The little white tiger had developed a cleanliness obsession recently and didn’t like raw food much anymore. It also seemed to be in the fasting period and didn’t eat much. However, when it saw Ranran eating, it would also want to take a bite.</p>
<p>But with the three humans and one tiger eating happily, the aroma of the food disrupted the meditation of the fellow cultivators.</p>
<p>Those who weren’t very hungry before suddenly felt their stomachs churning rapidly when they smelled the fragrance of the chicken.</p>
<p>They don’t know what those Xishan fools did, but the spices they used have a unique aroma that makes one salivate and desperately swallow saliva.</p>
<p>Now, the pair of twins from the KongShan Sect couldn’t stand it anymore. Wen Bingqing and Wen Yujie walked over and kicked their fire pit, cursing, “What kind of nonsense are you making? Are you deliberately disrupting our meditation? If you want to eat, go home and eat!”</p>
<p>Ranran reacted quickly, holding her chicken leg and pancake and quickly dodged away.</p>
<p>The names of these twins sound pure and virtuous, but who would have thought they were so domineering, not even letting others have dinner. Gao Cang’s pancake was kicked away, and he couldn’t help but curse, “Why is the KongShan Sect full of shrews? If you don’t want to eat, why not let others eat?”</p>
<p>Qiu Xier was also furious and rushed forward to hit the sisters’ faces, but Ranran stopped them.</p>
<p>After all, the abilities of the three of them couldn’t match the outstanding disciples of Kongshan Sect. If they really fought, they would be the ones at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>However, the temper of the little tiger couldn’t be restrained by humans. It suddenly kicked its hind legs and silently pounced towards the Wen sisters.</p>
<p>The sisters were caught off guard, and their necks were scratched, drawing blood. They were so angry that they drew their swords, intending to kill the beast.</p>

<p>Wei Fang had accompanied Mu Qingge to XiShan for her treasures before, so he naturally recognized the Gengjin White Tiger.</p>
<p>When he reminded everyone that this cat-like creature was Mu Qingge’s former mount, the Wen sisters cautiously took a few steps back.</p>
<p>The ferocity of the Gengjin White Tiger was well known to everyone. Although it looked like a furball now, if it were to erupt in the next moment, it wouldn’t be pleasant if someone got injured by it.</p>
<p>After scratching them, the white tiger swished its tail and left.</p>
<p>So the Wen sisters could only vent their anger at Mu Qingge, “Look at the beast you raised!”</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu sat by the side resting. At their words, she raised her eyebrows casually, “I have already severed the contract with the white tiger. What it does has nothing to do with me…”</p>
<p>Although Elder Mu had the temperament of a fairy, her stomach started rumbling as well after speaking, apparently also tempted by the delicious scent of XiShan’s dinner.</p>
<p>At this moment, Gui Baqian walked over, took out the dried sweet potato pieces that Ranran had given him earlier, and passed them to Mu Qingge.</p>
<p>Seeing this, the Wen sisters were furious again, accusing Gui Baqian of being too forward and embarrassing the KongShan Sect.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge smiled and accepted the sweet potato snack, but she didn’t eat them. She politely thanked Baqian for them.</p>
<p>Gui Baqian decided he wasn’t leaving. He simply sat down beside Mu Qingge and continued to openly stare at her, which was rather improper. But Mu Qingge tilted her head and smiled at him, engaging in a casual conversation. Her every move and expression exuded charm.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier whispered softly, “Our former Grandmaster looks so charming; she has admirers everywhere! But that boy is too impolite to take what you’ve given him to offer it to her like that!”</p>
<p>Ranran smiled, not minding these trivial matters at all. Tianmai Mountain was formed when Dun Tian passed away during meditation, with subtle energies flowing everywhere. Ranran was curious about what the next challenge would be.</p>
<p>However, Elder Mu should be the most confident, having been here before and won. It seemed like this opportunity would be hers as well.</p>
<p>With a mindset of seeing the world and gaining experience, Ranran felt completely relaxed, finishing the bread and meat in her hand happily.</p>
<p>After their fire was put out, Gao Cang and Qiu Xier also finished their food. They found a place far from other sects to meditate and wait for dawn.</p>
<p>As for what the second challenge would be, Shifu Su Yishui didn’t specify. He simply mentioned that besides the first challenge, the rest were illusions created by the ancient powers of Tianmai Mountain. They would adjust according to the strength of the participants each time, so they just needed to remain calm and focused to handle it.</p>
<p>Ranran wasn’t very interested in the Marrow Cleansing Pool. In fact, she had hoped that second senior brother could get the opportunity to restore his spiritual energy. Unfortunately, second senior brother has been with Uncle Master Zeng and seemed to have changed his mindset a lot, and was unwilling to come along.</p>
<p>There were over a dozen people who made it to this round, and their trio from XiShan were at the bottom. So, with the mindset of just gaining experience, the three of them were the most relaxed among everyone else.</p>
<p>When dawn arrived, everyone else began to move forward quickly, while Ranran and her group stopped from time to time on the mountain to pick wild fruits to eat.</p>
<p>Ranran noticed that brother Baqian was also not walking very fast, seeming to intentionally wait for them.</p>
<p>So when she met Baqian again on the small path, she couldn’t help but ask directly, “Brother Baqian, why are you walking so slowly? Your two fellow sect members have gone far ahead.”</p>
<p>Baqian smiled and raised his eyebrows, his dark skin making his teeth look very white. He slowly said, “It seems like you’re not in a hurry to move forward. Did Elder Su instruct you on something?”</p>
<p>Ranran understood now. This guy was suspicious that they had some cheating trick, and was deliberately probing with his words.</p>
<p>She smiled and shook her head, “Shifu’s participation in the Marrow Cleansing Pool was over twenty years ago. Didn’t they say that the questions in the Marrow Cleansing Pool are almost never the same each time? Besides, your Abbess from Kongshan Sect had also passed the trial before, right? If there were any tricks, she would have passed them down to her disciples and grand-disciples long ago. But I can tell you a secret, if we climb this mountain too quickly, will be very tiring!”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Baqian’s smile seemed deeper, but his tone was cold, “Are you deliberately toying with me?”</p>
<p>Qiu Xier, who disliked people from the Kongshan Sect, couldn’t hold back and said bluntly, “Ranran, don’t talk too much with the mad dogs from the Kongshan Sect. If they feel unhappy, they might come and kick the fire.”</p>
<p>Just then, screams came from ahead.</p>
<p>They didn’t have time to argue and hurried along. It turned out that ahead was a tall mountain valley, with two sides connected by a rope bridge made of vines and rudimentary wooden planks. To cross, they had to climb the ropes and step on the creaking wooden planks.</p>
<p>For cultivators who had reached a certain level, this wasn’t much of a challenge. Even without the planks, they could easily cross the valley by climbing the ropes.</p>
<p>But the problem lies in the fact that the rope ladder is covered with vines and plants. However, these dark green plants seem somewhat strange; upon closer inspection, one would notice that they are wriggling.</p>
<p>Ranran took a closer look and gasped in shock.</p>
<p>What vines? They are clearly a mass of dark green venomous snakes entangled and coiled on the bridge. Moreover, each snake was not small in size, with open fangs and venomous tongues, their bellies bulging like wings, looking extremely terrifying.</p>
<p>The screams earlier had come from the Wen twins. Both of them seemed to be very afraid of snakes. They had stepped on the soft snake bodies while walking ahead, hence their hysterical screams.</p>
<p>Even those who weren’t afraid of snakes would feel their scalp tingle at the sight of this gathering of cold and poisonous creatures.</p>
<p>The dozen or so people glanced at each other, vaguely understanding that this might be the second challenge of the trial.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier tightly held Ranran’s hand and whispered, “The further we go, the harder it gets. Why don’t we stop here and go back home? They are all too strong, and we can’t compare to them.”</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t say anything because at this moment, the disciples of Feiyun Mountain from the three major sects were already preparing to go first.</p>
<p>Feiyun Sect specialized in *gold of the Five Elements, and are skilled in using various golden needle hidden weapons. When they saw the bridge filled with venomous snakes, they immediately took out the hidden golden needle cylinders from their sleeves and aimed at the snakes. Hundreds and thousands of golden needles shot out with a cold light, piercing the snakes’ bodies.<br/>*<em> literally gold but actually metal </em>金木水火土 ( the five elements )</p>
<p>These hidden cylinders were equipped with special springs, empowered by the spiritual power of the wielder. Every needle pierced deep into the snakes’ flesh and bones, causing them to twist and fall into the gorge.</p>
<p>Just as everyone breathed a sigh of relief and prepared to cross the bridge, a loud horn-like wailing sound from a wooden statue suddenly came from the other end of the bridge.</p>
<p>Accompanied by that sound, countless dark green venomous snakes surged from the other end of the bridge, once again occupying the entire rope bridge.</p>
<p>However, the Feiyun Mountain disciples had already used up most of their needle cylinders and couldn’t continue.</p>
<p>At this moment, someone grew impatient and, relying on their excellent lightness technique, attempted to leap and step on the snake bodies to cross. Only those with considerable skills would dare to attempt this. The distance in the valley was quite long, so even with a superb lightness technique, they would still need to land a couple of times, then use the force to continue forward.</p>
<p>At first, that person looked quite promising, accurately landing on snake bodies and immediately leaping. Their agile body boosted the confidence of the remaining people.</p>
<p>However, when it came to the final jump to cross the bridge, dozens of large snakes suddenly sprang up, entangling the person and pulling him down.</p>
<p>The person quickly swung their sword, but alas, the snakes managed to bite them a few times. The snake venom spread rapidly, and soon, the person’s face turned green, their body stiffening as they fell straight down the gorge.</p>
<p>The valley seemed quite deep, and after the person’s screams echoed for a while, they heard a thud from the mist-covered bottom of the valley.</p>
<p>Now, the remaining people looked at each other, none daring to act rashly.</p>
<p>Ordinary snake venom couldn’t affect cultivators, as their breathing practices of controlling the urgency of blood flow was part of cultivating inner energy.</p>
<p>Since the person had passed the first challenge alone, that showed he had a decent cultivation foundation. However, he couldn’t even adjust his circulation in time after being bitten by the snakes, becoming paralyzed immediately, which indicated how potent the snake venom was.</p>
<p>Just then, Gui Baqian suddenly walked to the edge of the bridge, picked up a wooden stick, infused it with true qi, and flames burst out instantly. He then threw the ignited stick onto the bridge, and in an instant, the flames soared high. The green snakes twisted in the fire, about to turn into ashes.</p>
<p>However, Ranran exclaimed softly, “Not good, the bridge is going to burn down too!”</p>
<p>The fire turned out too strong, burning through the ropes of the bridge in an instant. Seeing that the bridge had been burned through in several places and a few wooden planks had fallen, the water-based Jiuhua Sect disciples, immediately tried to put out the fire with water, but it was unstoppable.</p>
<p>It was Gui Baqian who realized that the bridge couldn’t withstand the fire, so he withdrew it back.</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned by his exceptional fire-controlling ability. Even the twin sisters from his sect looked at him with astonishment, clearly not aware of this new junior disciple’s skills.</p>
<p>At this moment, the Jiuhua Sect disciples had a clever idea of freezing the snakes with water to create a stable path. However, just as the ice formed, the bridge couldn’t bear the sudden increase in weight and broke two more ropes, causing several wooden planks to fall.</p>
<p>The bridge was now shaky, with only one rope left.</p>
<p>Wei Fang was frustrated and said, “Look at what you’ve done! Without the bridge, we can’t jump to the other side!”</p>
<p>Gui Baqian just smiled indifferently, his teeth dazzlingly white, looking unconcerned.</p>
<p>Now that several attempts had failed, the only remaining route seemed to be cut off as well. Wei Fang sighed, “This is great, now we can’t go over at all. It looks like we’ll miss out on the Marrow Cleansing Pool again this year.”</p>
<p>After all, there had been years when there were no outstanding disciples showing up, resulting in no winners for that year.</p>
<p>Just then, Gui Baqian suddenly made a move, chopping the bridge with a single stroke. Then, amidst everyone’s exclamations, he leaped over the broken bridge in one go, riding on the wind and landed on the other side.</p>
<p>Such skill in manipulating the wind was a move only mastered by the Heads of the major sects. No one had expected this new disciple from the Kongshan Sect to possess such ability, and he was quite unscrupulous too.</p>
<p>Clearly, he could have made the jump earlier, but he waited until everyone was out of options before cutting the bridge and crossing the valley, to block the advancement of others.</p>
<p>Looking back now, it seemed like he intentionally burned the bridge, as he didn’t care about crossing on the bridge himself; he just wanted to destroy it.</p>
<p>After crossing the bridge, Gui Baqian ignored the curses and complaints from the other end of the valley. He laughed coldly and continued on his way.</p>
<p>With no one else in competition with him and his unfathomable abilities, it seemed like he was the sure winner of this Marrow Cleansing Pool trial.</p>
<p>After Gui Baqian left, the Wen sisters became besieged by the rest.</p>
<p>Wei Fang was red-eyed with anger, his veins bulging as he shouted, “What kind of demonic recruit did your Kongshan Sect bring in? Why are your actions so unethical?”</p>
<p>The twins were also tricked by this conniving new junior brother. They couldn’t pass the valley and now had to take the blame for that boy’s actions, which made them well up with angry tears.</p>
<p>Some people are demoralized by now and started to team up and prepare to go down the mountain. Out of over a dozen of them, four of them left.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier said to Ranran and their senior brother, “Let’s leave too. It’s getting dark soon, and it’s not going to be easy to travel at night. If poisonous snakes come out again, we could really die.”</p>
<p>However, Ranran stood still, not moving at all. Suddenly, she clapped her hands and stopped Weifang and others who had finished their cursing and were getting ready to leave. “I have an idea. I don’t know if you’re willing to cooperate with us?”</p>
<p>Weifang looked at the shrimp soldiers and crab generals from Xishan with surprise and doubt. “What’s your idea?”</p>
<p>Ranran said, “Jiuhua sect is proficient in the water element, while we in Xishan specialize in the wood element, and the Kongshan sect specializes in the earth element. If the three of us join forces, we might accomplish something.”</p>
<p>The twin sisters also came over and asked, “How can we accomplish something?”</p>
<p>Ranran asked the senior brother to take out the small spade he always carried with him – as disciples of the divine physician Su Yishui, they are always on the look out for good herbs when they enter the mountains, so he often carried the spade with him.</p>
<p>After Gao Cang took the spade, Ranran walked a few rounds in the dense forest and finally dug out a young shoot of a vine plant.</p>
<p>Everyone looked closely and saw that it was the commonly seen Flying Dragon Blood Vine. This kind of vine usually grew on large trees, but once it matured, it would become very sturdy.</p>
<p>But what was she doing with a sprout of a vine? Did she expect it to grow into a vine bridge in a short time?</p>
<p>Weifang was too lazy to roll his eyes; he just said coldly, “Are you kidding us?”</p>
<p>But Ranran was not joking at all. She planted the vine shoot on the edge of the canyon and then inserted a wooden stick into the ground facing the opposite side of the canyon. She then closed her eyes devoutly and muttered something in her mouth.</p>
<p>If one got close enough, they could hear her murmuring words like “Little baby, grow up quickly.”</p>
<p>Weifang felt that he had spent enough time hanging out with fools. Since Mu Qingge’s generation, it seemed like that there were always some eccentric people in Xishan sect.</p>
<p>At that moment, Ranran took out the “ten years in a day” talisman gifted to her by Elder Jiu and stuck it on the vine.</p>
<p>In a flash, the originally finger-sized vine began to rapidly grow and entwine, soon extending forward along the wooden stick.</p>
<p>However, as the plant was growing too fast, and the nutrients and water in the soil were not enough. Its leaves started to turn slightly yellow.</p>
<p>The twin sisters finally lived up to their names; they quickly understood Ranran’s idea and silently used a soil-moving technique to continuously transport fertile soil from all directions.</p>
<p>Ranran motioned towards Weifang, “Will the friend in Tao please water it a bit. This will help it grow faster.”</p>
<p>Weifang also understood now and immediately silently used a water technique to rapidly irrigate the vine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ranran took a dozen wooden sticks and her own fishing line, used light body technique to quickly ascend the vine bridge, and continued to connect the vine, guiding it forward along the wooden sticks.</p>
<p>Everyone watched in amazement as Ranran’s agile figure moved like a colorful butterfly. Such Light body technique seemed impossible without decades of cultivation…</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu had been watching from the side. Even though she had a smile of admiration on her face, but her hand by her side began to clench, and her arm even trembled slightly. The shadow cast over her by her outstanding sister in her previous life has resurfaced again…</p>
<p>Soon, the vine extended across to the opposite side of the canyon, and the vine itself began to grow thicker.</p>
<p>Ranran was the second to arrive at the opposite side of the canyon after Gui Baqian.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge was the third one to effortlessly jump over.</p>
<p>Seeing this, everyone was afraid that the girl from XiShan would follow in the footsteps of Gui Baqian and cut off the vine bridge. They all rushed to cross the vine bridge one by one, running and leaping across the vine bridge.</p>
<p>Ranran had to call out, “Take it slow, too many people will cause it to fall! Hey, you! Can you not push other people!”</p>
<p>However, there were also people whose light body technique was not up to par, such as Qiu Xier. After taking a few steps, she felt the vine sagging downward. She was frightened and immediately retreated. And because the vine had grown too fast, it also fell down at last.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier shouted over to Ranran and the senior brother with a mournful face, “You guys continue ahead; I can’t make it. I’ll wait for you at the foot of the mountain!”</p>
<p>Ranran knew that Qiu Xier was timid and didn’t force her, so she continued with their senior brother.</p>
<p>However, only seven people passed through this snake bridge checkpoint in the end.</p>
<p>Gui Baqian, who was the first to cross the bridge, had long disappeared from view. The ones left were the twin sisters Bing Qing and Yu Jie, Ranran and senior brother Gao Cang, Wei Fang from JiuHua, and Mu Qingge.</p>
<p>Wei Fang was still annoyed by Gui Baqian’s trickery and kept complaining to the sisters from Kongshan sect.</p>
<p>The elder twin sister, Wen Bingqing, couldn’t take it anymore and said glaring, “He is Master Uncle Wen Hongshan’s cousin, just someone who found a connection in. Who knows what his background is? If you have the ability, when you see him later, go argue with him. What’s the point of complaining to us?”</p>
<p>Wei Fang, feeling embarrassed, shot her another look and then quickly walked ahead.</p>
<p>As the terrain of Tianmai Mountain was extremely high, the higher they went, the colder it became. Ranran opened the small package given to her by her second senior brother and found that besides the soft silver armor made by Uncle Master Zeng, inside there was also a warm coat to keep out the cold, as well as a pair of finger hooks that could be worn on the hands.</p>
<p>Unlike the common finger hooks, these hooks could be hidden when not in use, appearing as a beautiful chain accessory for a young girl. But when pressed, spikes could pop out.</p>
<p>Ranran hid behind the bushes, put on the coat and soft silver armor, and also the finger hooks. She took a deep breath and came out to say to Gao Cang, “Senior Brother, let’s move slowly. Remember to keep a distance from Gui Baqian when you see him later.”</p>
<p>Gao Cang nodded straightforwardly and asked, “Junior Sister, what do you think Gui Baqian is up to?”</p>
<p>Ranran lightly furrowed her brows and said in a small voice, “I always feel like he… is like…”</p>
<p>Before she could finish, the sound of birds chirping suddenly came from afar.</p>
<p>The other four people walking in front also stopped one after another. They saw a bright red firebird leading a group of birds from the mountains, soaring into the sky and circling while chirping.</p>
<p>Wei Fang saw this and couldn’t help but exclaim excitedly, “This… is the Lingguang Divine Lord!”</p>
<p>The so-called Lingguang Divine Lord was commonly known as the Vermilion Bird in folklore, just like the Gengjin White Tiger, both being divine beasts with supreme spiritual power.</p>
<p>However, the Vermilion Bird was inherently aloof and usually resided in the northern sea, rarely leaving any traces, making it extremely rare for anyone to see it with their own eyes.</p>
<p>For a cultivator, if they could tame the Vermilion Bird as their mount, would be extremely enticing. It’s akin to the luxurious chariots and prized horses of the secular world, a symbol of supreme honor.</p>
<p>Even if one couldn’t tame it, just injuring it to obtain some Vermilion Bird’s blood would not be bad either. It was said that this blood was an essential ingredient for refining the Nine Turns Resurrection Pill, a priceless item.</p>
<p>Encountering the Vermilion Bird and not obtaining some spiritual blood would be a waste of such a rare opportunity.</p>
<p>Moreover, the small size of the Vermilion Bird indicated that it was still a young bird, which is the best time for taming. In this moment, several younger disciples were all eager to try to subdue the Vermilion Bird.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge’s eyes also brightened. Choosing a mount was a matter of great importance for cultivators. If she could obtain a spiritual beast that benefited her, it would enhance her cultivation when she formed a Soul Contract with it.</p>
<p>Her elder sister had the Gengjin White Tiger back then, which looked majestic and made others envious. If she could also have a mount as excellent as the White Tiger, it would be worth being reborn…</p>
<p>Thinking of this, she dashed forward too.</p>
<p>Ranran, however, did not want that. Taking care of the little white tiger already took up a lot of her time; if she had another bird, it would be difficult to split her time fairly between them. As for obtaining the bird’s blood and such, Ranran was even less interested.</p>
<p>Shifu had once said that entering Tianmai Mountain not only tested one’s foundational spiritual power but also their character. Her Shifu had instructed her to come here just for a bath; she didn’t want to get involved in unnecessary trouble.</p>
<p>Every plant and tree here had been nurtured by the spiritual power of the ancient powerful being . She didn’t have much ability herself, so it was better not to be too greedy and desire what was beyond her reach.</p>
<p>So while Wei Fang and the others were climbing up the branches to look for the Vermilion Bird’s location, Ranran and the eldest senior brother actually walked to the front.</p>
<p>After passing through a mountain hollow, the entire forest suddenly became quiet, and the sounds of birds chirping ceased.</p>
<p>Gao Cang was bewildered and muttered to himself, “Why did the sounds stop so suddenly? Could it be that Wei Fang and the others have already caught the Vermilion Bird?”</p>
<p>However, Ranran looked around vigilantly and whispered, “No, it seems like we’ve entered some kind of spiritual shield that isolates us from the outside world.”</p>
<p>But as soon as she turned her head, the eldest senior brother was also gone, leaving her by herself. Ranran called out for him a few times, took a deep breath and decided to continue forward.</p>
<p>The environment here was completely different from the dense and majestic atmosphere of Tianmai Mountain. The ground was paved with stone slabs, and there were fences with chrysanthemums, apricot trees, and thatched cottages ahead, giving off a pastoral vibe of “picking chrysanthemums under the eastern fence, leisurely watching the southern mountains.”</p>
<p>Who could be living in this dangerous place surrounded by fierce beasts, in the vast and lonely mountains.</p>

<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Seeing this little countryside dwelling, Xue Ranran cautiously pulled out her mechanism staff.</p>
<p>After experiencing the enticing and dangerous water demon from the Wangxiang river incident, who knew if this cottage in front of her was some demon’s illusion, intending to take people’s lives.</p>
<p>Ranran bravely walked along the stone path for a while but found that the path was soft, like wet soil. After taking a few steps, she saw patches of green sprouts.</p>
<p>She often helped Su Yishui dry medicinal herbs and immediately recognized that all the herbs here were medicinal.</p>
<p>Just then, she heard someone in the courtyard saying, “Strange, why is someone here so early? Could it be some ignorant bumpkin who doesn’t know the value of that Vermilion Bird?”</p>
<p>Ranran looked closely and saw an old man with white hair and beard, wearing Taoist robes and lifting up his trousers, examining several rows of green seedlings in the ground.</p>
<p>Ranran blinked hesitantly… This old man with white hair and beard… wasn’t he Elder Jiu from Cuiwei Mountain?</p>
<p>He had gifted her with many talismans back then, all precious life-saving treasures!</p>
<p>But when Ranran smiled and waved at him, the old man looked at her indifferently, seemingly not recognizing her.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t immediately call out his name but tentatively asked, “Old sir, how have you been lately?”</p>
<p>The old man didn’t respond but stood up straight, examining her up and down. After a while, he suddenly asked, “Young girl, have you ever eaten Dragon Molt?”</p>
<p>Ranran, following her gourmand instincts, asked in return, “Dragon Molt? What does it taste like?”</p>
<p>The old man replied unhurriedly, “Very fishy and stinky; a sip of it will be unforgettable for a lifetime.”</p>
<p>After this hint by the old man, Ranran immediately thought of the disgusting medicine her master once gave her to drink, making her unable to eat for days.</p>
<p>She had asked Su Yishui what it was back then, but he refused to tell her, saying it was better for her not to know. Could it be… that drink was the Dragon molt the old man mentioned?</p>
<p>Seeing no reply from Ranran, the old man didn’t seem to mind either. He just took another look at her again and said, “Dragon molt can conceal a person’s spiritual essence, making it difficult to discern the cycle of reincarnation. What kind of demon are you? That you need to disguise this way?’</p>
<p>Ranran crouched down, glanced at the crops he was planting, and cleverly replied, “I’m just an ordinary little girl. I don’t understand what you’re talking about, sir. Those who can live in these deep mountains must be immortals. Do you have a demon-revealing mirror to test on me?”</p>
<p>The old man grinned, no longer concerned about whether she was human or demon, and went straight to ask, ‘Why don’t you go and contend for that Vermilion Bird?’</p>
<p>Ranran smiled, “In this world, there are many other things as precious as the Vermilion Bird. If we try to claim everything that we see as ours, won’t that be so exhausting. Besides, who knows if a misfortune might turn out to be a blessing? If I hadn’t come here earlier, how could I have met you, Old Sir… The Huai Shan and Dang Gui in your field are really good things. When cooked with black chicken, they are not only delicious but also nutritious and beneficial for health!'”</p>
<p>The old man listened to Ranran’s playful reply and laughed heartily again, “I thought you were a saint, turns out you’re just a greedy lazy girl! It’s a pity, this is just an illusion. These herbs can’t be used to make chicken soup for you.”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran blinked a few times, and reached out to touch the herbs. Sure enough, there was nothing there at her touch.</p>
<p>However, the old man looked around the scenery with great nostalgia and said slowly, “When I first met Dun Tian, I was just a teenager. He lived on the mountain, I lived below. Like a teacher and friend, really unforgettable. Later, he ascended, and I focused on cultivation, thinking we would meet again in the immortal realm. But who knew when I ascended, he had turned into nothingness, such is fate…”</p>
<p>Ranran listened, blinking at the old man. It seemed he was already over a hundred years old… She thought for a moment and suddenly asked, “May I ask if you know Elder Jiu?”</p>
<p>The old man nodded with a smile, “You actually know my younger brother? No wonder you used Little Jiu’s talisman when you were crossing the bridge.”</p>
<p>Ranran nodded and said, “I’ve had a brief encounter with Elder Jiu before, and drank wine once with him. You really look like Elder Jiu, just missing a red wine-soaked nose. That talisman had been given to me by Elder Jiu.”</p>
<p>When she first saw this old man, she thought Elder Jiu had come here from Cuiwei Mountain.</p>
<p>But seeing his steady demeanor, with an aura of an old immortal, completely different from Elder Jiu’s mischievous childlike temperament, she ventured to guess that this old man should be the powerful brother of Elder Jiu, The Medicine Immortal who had already ascended. That’s why she asked.</p>
<p>However, she wondered why he, who had ascended long ago, would appear in Tianmai Mountain and seem to be very updated with the situation of these younger disciples passing through the trials.</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal laughed after hearing Ranran’s words, “My brother had very few close friends in his life, never knew he made such a young friend like you. But now, it does seem like you have some extraordinary qualities…”</p>
<p>As he spoke, he picked up the whisk hanging from his waist and waved it in the air, revealing the situation at the Vermilion Bird’s location.</p>
<p>The originally pheasant-sized Vermilion Bird, for some reason, had suddenly increased several times in size, its slightly curved beak emitting a deafening cry, its giant claws scratching at the approaching people frantically.</p>
<p>Wei Fang was even picked up by the Vermilion Bird and thrown fiercely towards a steep cliff.</p>
<p>The remaining people were also in a sorry state. The Wen twins couldn’t be bothered about the others and hurriedly followed the path that Ranran was on, turning around the mountain stream and fleeing in panic.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge, on the other hand, dealt with the situation calmly, dodging quickly with her agile skills. However, Ranran noticed that, in the chaos, Mu Qingge took out many mud-like balls from her pocket and threw them onto the slope…</p>
<p>But strangely, the scene that followed with these panicked people who turned around and followed Ranran’s path wasn’t the stone path, thatched cottages and herb fields, but a dense forest and a stream.</p>
<p>It seemed Ranran’s guess was correct; she and senior brother had indeed stumbled upon a place like the legendary Wuling Fishermen’s otherworldly grounds—not the Tianmai Mountain!</p>
<p>With another wave of his whisk, the Medicine Immortal showed another valley, where Brother Baqian who crossed the Snake Bridge early was fighting, not with the Vermilion Bird, but with a hornless black dragon.</p>
<p>The black dragon looked fierce, but it was already severely injured by Gui Baqian. Covered in wounds, he finally twisted the black dragon’s neck, opened its belly, took out its gallbladder, and swallowed it in one gulp.</p>
<p>After eating the dragon’s gall, Gui Baqian casually threw the spiritual beast’s body into the mountain stream. He wiped his mouth, and continued forward.</p>
<p>Ranran was curious, “Why didn’t he encounter the Vermilion Bird?”</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal smiled, “He’s not on the righteous path; the Vermilion Bird’s blood is useless to him, but the black dragon’s gall is greatly beneficial. The spiritual beasts you encounter here are born from human greed. They only face their own temptations. Lacking ability, undeserving virtue, they only magnify their greed infinitely. With only brute force and no compassion, they will eventually be consumed by uncontrolled greed… Of course, those who can kill spiritual beasts also pass the test and are qualified to enter the pool… It’s a pity for that black dragon. Last time, it only lost its skin, but this time, its gall was taken…”</p>
<p>Ranran suddenly recalled that she had once drunk dragon molt. How could her master possess such a precious thing? It was priceless!</p>
<p>Could it be her Shifu Su Yishui, who defeated the black dragon last time? But the elderly man said that only those not on the righteous path would encounter the black dragon, right?</p>
<p>Ranran was confused and nodded helplessly, “Tianmai Mountain’s powerful being Dun Tian must have trained many outstanding disciples before. Just like my Shifu who enjoys putting people through rigorous tests. However, aren’t these tests too cold-blooded and harsh? There has already been many deaths from yesterday till now.”</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal retracted his whisk, his smile slightly reduced, “Even though the trials are horrifying, aren’t people even more attracted to it? Great Immortal Dun Tian sat in loneliness and turned into a mountain. His ancient divine power condensed into his eyes, evolving into pools. To obtain such pure divine power from the Great Immortal, how could it be obtained easily without paying a price? My task is to come here every ten years and supervise those who pass the trials. However, you have passed too quickly, which really surprised me.”</p>
<p>Ranran scratched her head in embarrassment, feeling like she had *stumbled upon a treasure unknowingly. She then asked politely, “My eldest senior brother and I are not the most talented among these people. It’s just a coincidence that we came here. May I ask where he is?”<br/>*瞎猫撞到了死耗子<em> literally a blind cat who stumbled onto a dead rat</em></p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal said calmly, “He didn’t pass through with his own strength but was led here by you. So even though he glimpsed the immortal realm, he was immediately bounced out. As long as he doesn’t try to kill the Vermilion Bird, he should be fine. This is an illusion formed from my secular memories before I ascended. Your ability to enter here is also a fate connection with me.”</p>
<p>Ranran tilted her head and asked, “Do you have to give up the joys of mortals when you became an immortal? What’s the point of becoming an immortal then?”</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal smiled, “Without worldly desires of mortals, there’s no joy or sorrow. What then is unhappiness?”</p>
<p>Since Ranran heard that her senior brother should be fine, she relaxed a little and asked, “Old sir, in that case when can I leave, otherwise it will be dark soon, and I’m afraid my senior brother will get lost.”</p>
<p>Medicine Immortal’s smile deepened as he looked at this whimsical and clever girl and said, “Although your spiritual power is not profound, your intelligence and adaptability is the best among these people. Although the Dragon molt has obscured your innate spiritual foundation, you are by no means ordinary. Because of your outstanding performance, you now have the opportunity to choose the Marrow Cleansing Spirit Pool first. Follow me.”</p>
<p>Ranran followed behind the old man. Just a few steps in, she saw a chubby boy poking his round head out of a grass hut, holding a water jug and crying, “Big brother, what’s in here, it’s so spicy! I don’t want to drink this, I want to drink goat’s milk!”</p>
<p>Ranran was momentarily stunned. Although the boy was young, his eyebrows and eyes, especially the pouting expression of stubbornness, resembled Elder Jiu, who was fond of drinking.</p>
<p>She stopped for a moment, realizing that this boy had repeatedly cried out from inside the house, and his words were exactly the same each time.</p>
<p>Ranran suddenly understood, that these were the memories that Medicine Immortal found hardest to let go of as a mortal. And the person he found hardest to let go of should be his younger brother.</p>
<p>However, no matter how the boy cried, the old Medicine Immortal didn’t turn back. He just floated in mid-air with crossed legs, leaving this illusionary scene, leading Ranran through a bamboo forest, to a mist-covered poolside.</p>
<p>As the mist dispersed, Ranran discovered that there were actually two lake-like pools here. The surrounding mountain ridges and huge rocks were fully exposed, giving the impression of an old wrinkled face, with the two pools resembling the eyes on the face.</p>
<p>However, these two pools were quite different. One was milky white like cow’s milk, while the other was a deep pitch black.</p>
<p>Medicine Immortal pointed and said, “This is the Marrow Cleansing Pool. You can choose whichever one you like.”</p>
<p>Ranran looked at the two pools, both exuding profound and mysterious energies. She couldn’t help but ask curiously, “May I ask, Great Immortal, what is the difference between these two pools?”</p>
<p>Medicine Immortal said mildly, “Both are the divine powers that cultivators dream of. Before Dun Tian ascended, he once fell into demonic cultivation, where good and evil were hard to separate. He feared losing control, so he divided his spiritual power into two pools. The white one follows a gradual path, slightly slower in spiritual advancement. The black one, however, can advance one’s cultivation rapidly, but…”</p>
<p>At this point, he paused, then continued, “After bathing in the black water, one must sever emotions and resolve, and give up their deepest love in this lifetime.”</p>
<p>Ranran gasped at this and thought for a moment before saying, “My Shifu and Grandmaster Mu should have chosen the white pool, right? Life might be short, but we shouldn’t be too hasty. I will build up my spiritual power slowly .”</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal was not surprised that this free-spirited girl would choose the white pool. But since she mentioned Grandmaster Mu, did she mean Mu Qingge?</p>
<p>When Medicine Immortal asked, Ranran nodded honestly.</p>
<p>Medicine Immortal looked at her with some surprise and said with a smile, “So, you’re Mu Qingge’s grand-disciple. No wonder, no wonder…”</p>
<p>When he asked about her master, Ranran said, “Of course, it’s Su Yishui from XiShan.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, the divine smile on the old man’s face disappeared instantly. He looked at her in astonishment and said, “You said your master is Su Yishui? The son of the former Prince Ping?”</p>
<p>Ranran nodded, feeling puzzled. “Old Immortal, do you know my Shifu?”</p>
<p>Medicine Immortal’s smile completely faded, his expression cold as he extended his finger to calculate for a while. Finally, as if encountering an unsolvable problem, he shook his head and sighed, “Forget it, forget it. What heaven decrees is not necessarily what fate dictates…”</p>
<p>With that, he said no more, waved his whisk, and turned to leave, leaving Ranran standing alone by the poolside.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until he disappeared into the mist that a faint voice came, “Your master’s choice back then was different from yours.”</p>
<p>Ranran was confused, not quite understanding what the Old Immortal meant.</p>
<p>Was her Shifu’s choice different from hers? Did he choose not to bathe in the pool, or… did he choose that eerie and terrifying black pool?</p>
<p>But thinking about it, there should be some ambiguity in the Old immortal’s words. Shifu is a person of integrity, how could he choose the black pool that extinguishes human relationships and true love?</p>
<p>It must be some misunderstanding in his words.</p>
<p>But she also needed to quickly bathe in the pool and go down the mountain. After all, her seniors were all still waiting for her.</p>
<p>So, she took off her shoes and outer clothes, slowly walked into the pool glowing with light, and as soon as she entered the pool, she immediately felt an indescribable warmth gathering in her dantian, circulating throughout her body along her meridians. Ranran involuntarily closed her eyes, floating on the surface of the water…</p>
<p>When she opened her eyes again, she found herself suspended in mid-air, feeling an inexplicable heaviness of spiritual energy on her body. This feeling of a filled dantian seemed to also be very calming and sets one at ease.</p>
<p>And at some unknown point, the Geng jin White Tiger had been sitting by the side of the pool, looking at her with an indescribable sense of melancholy, appearing mysterious and profound…</p>
<p>When Ranran lightly landed on the ground with her toes, she found that her clothes were completely dry. She asked the White Tiger, “Are you going to have a bathe too?”</p>
<p>But the white tiger slowly turned its head and looked towards the other side of the black pool. Following its gaze, Ranran saw someone in the black pool.</p>
<p>As she approached, splashes of water flew from the black pool, and suddenly, a shirtless man emerged from the pool.</p>
<p>That dark face was unmistakable; it was Gui Baqian, who had single-handedly defeated the black dragon earlier.</p>
<p>Clearly, they had all arrived at the same destination despite taking different paths. Although he captured spiritual beasts by succumbing to greed, his overpowering strength still earned him the qualification to enter the pool.</p>
<p>But he had chosen the Black Pool for rapid cultivation. At this moment, the water in that pool seemed a bit lighter, while the depths of his eyes remained black and indiscernible.</p>
<p>Ranran noticed the stark contrast of the skin between his face and his body, making his dark face even more conspicuous against his white body…</p>
<p>At this moment, Gui Baqian seemed to have just noticed Ranran standing in the white pool. He raised an eyebrow in surprise and said, “You actually made it here too?”</p>
<p>Ranran cautiously took a few steps back but didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>Just then, Gui Baqian seemed to have finished soaking. He leaped out of the water and charged straight at Ranran!</p>
<p>Although the little girl seemed quite capable and qualified to enter the Marrow-cleansing pool, Gui Baqian felt that there should only be one winner here. Tianmai Mountain truly did not judge strength accurately, allowing a laughable weakling like her to enter the white pool.</p>
<p>So, he decided to make the choice for heaven and eliminate this useless thing!</p>
<p>And so, his attack was a ruthless kill move and aimed directly at Ranran’s throat.</p>
<p>However, as he approached, there was a loud “clang” as if Gui Baqian had hit an invisible barrier and was instantly rebounded.</p>
<p>It so happens that there was a spiritual shield between the black and white pools. Once a choice was made, there was no turning back, and one couldn’t soak in both pools simultaneously.</p>
<p>Seeing the ferocious Gui Baqian unable to break through, Ranran felt completely relieved. She slowly opened her mouth and said with a smile, “Wei Jiu, have you no shame, pretending to be a disciple of the Kongshan Sect to cheat your way into the pool?”</p>
<p>Gui Baqian stabilized his posture upon hearing this and squinted at Ranran, saying, “How did you recognize me?”</p>
<p>Ranran leisurely put on her shoes and outer clothes, tilted her head, and said, “When you crossed Snake Bridge, your movement technique seemed familiar to me. I have a good memory, so I immediately remembered your fight with Shifu in the forest. And… your name is *Gui Baqian. If you add ‘woman,’ it becomes ‘Wei Jiu’…… When I thought about your ambiguous appearance, neither male nor female, I immediately realized that you are Wei Jiu.”<br/>魏 = 禾 +女+ 鬼     禾=八+千 <br/><em> Another ‘coincidence’ is 禾 is read as ‘he’, so his name is quite literally he,she,ghost</em></p>
<p>In fact, the name Wei Jiu was just something he casually used; he had never intended to imply anything about his naturally feminine appearance?</p>
<p>Everything else Ranran said was fine, but she inadvertently hit Wei Jiu’s raw nerve, telling him to his face that he looked like a woman. This made Gui Baqian clench his fists and smirk coldly. He then tore off his mask, revealing his androgynous face… indeed, he was the demonic cultivator Wei Jiu!</p>
<p>“You little brat, what’s your name again?” he asked through gritted teeth, his eyes gleaming with malice.</p>
<p>Ranran wasn’t going to answer him. After saying that, she made a face at Wei Jiu and ran away at top speed, with the white tiger at her side.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu swung his fist again. This time, he actually cracked the invisible barrier like a spider web. “You little brat, next time we meet will be your end!”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ranran fled like the wind from the marrow-cleansing pool, but she no longer saw the Medicine Immortal or the cottage and medicinal fields. Instead, she went straight back to the valley where they had separated from the others earlier.</p>
<p>Seeing Ranran return, Gao Cang, who had been frantically searching for her like a headless fly, was crying with joy. “Junior sister, where did you go? You nearly worried me to death…”</p>
<p>As he looked closely at Ranran, Gao Cang’s voice grew softer and softer until he couldn’t help but ask, “Junior sister, what’s that on your forehead?”</p>
<p>Hearing that, Ranran walked to the stream nearby, using its surface to look at her reflection. To her surprise, there was a flower-shaped pattern on her forehead, resembling the character “mai” in seal script.</p>
<p>At that moment, those who had been struggling with Vermilion Bird like Mu Qingge, Weifang and the others also approached. When Mu Ranwu saw the pattern on Ranran’s forehead, she was immediately shocked and widened her eyes, “How… have you already entered the marrow-cleansing pool?”</p>
<p>For the younger generation of cultivators, being able to enter the marrow-cleansing pool meant a smooth cultivation path in the future. Those who entered the pool would eventually become the heads of major sects, whether in the immortal or demonic path, reaching a level of cultivation that others could only dream of.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu knew well that her elder sister entering the marrow-cleansing pool, was an important step on the path to fame and power in the past.</p>
<p>Although she had acquired most of her elder sister’s spiritual power, this body was brand new. If she could cleanse her meridians and enhance her cultivation in the marrow-cleansing pool, the benefits would have been immense.</p>
<p>Most importantly, she had hoped that the marrow-cleansing pool would help her break free from the control of Grudge water. Who would have thought that Xue Ranran would bypass all obstacles with such ease like she had divine assistance, and successfully gain the opportunity to enter the pool.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Mu Ranwu’s words, Wei fang, covered in bloodstains, also noticed by now. He howled in frustration, “You worthless person, how could you be eligible to enter the pool? You must have pulled some trick when we were fighting the Vermilion Bird!”</p>
<p>As he spoke, he began to believe his own words, and he actually reached out to attack Ranran.</p>
<p>In the past, although Ranran could dodge, she definitely couldn’t confront Wei fang head-on and win. However, this time, she not only evaded skillfully but also handled it effortlessly, flicking Weifang’s forehead on a whim.</p>
<p>Although it seemed like only a playful action, this seemingly light flick sent Wei fang flying straight into the bushes.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">渔翁得利 THE THIRD PARTY WINS</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>This time, not to mention others, even Ranran herself was shocked—she did not really exert much force just now, so how could the power be so great?</p>
<p>But the benefit of this attack was that the disciples of the other prestigious sects who used to look down on Xi Shan as insignificant rookies wouldn’t easily speak disrespectfully anymore.</p>
<p>In just half a day, the cultivation of Xue Ranran had far surpassed those disciples who had been cultivating for decades in the path of cultivation.</p>
<p>When Mu Qingge had emerged from the marrow-cleansing pool in the past, she quickly gained fame and enjoyed a long period of glory. If she hadn’t later taken the wrong path and opened the gates of the Netherworld Realm privately, she might very well have become the leader of immortal cultivation world, a great figure admired by the masses.</p>
<p>The same was true for Su Yishui. After coming out of the marrow-cleansing pool, his power increased significantly. In fact, he could even surpass his own Master, even rebel and defeat Mu Qingge, helping the righteous path to uphold justice.</p>
<p>But they were originally outstanding individuals. Now, this rookie Ranran, who couldn’t even be ranked among the disciples of immortal cultivation, had leaped through the ranks like this.</p>
<p>It won’t be hard to imagine, that her future would be incredibly splendid, far beyond their reach.</p>
<p>The two sisters, Bingqing and Yujie, were more composed in their thoughts. They didn’t show frustration like Weifang did, and with a smile that barely maintained their dignity, they congratulated Xue Ranran with a respectful bow.</p>
<p>However, Mu Ranwu glanced at the resentful Weifang and others, reminding in a soft voice, “Congratulations, Miss Xue, but… you must be careful. The spiritual power infused into the marrow-cleansing pool is too strong, and your blood may not absorb it immediately. As long as the floral pattern on your forehead hasn’t disappeared, you must be cautious about your body, never let it bleed… There have been cases in the past where powerful individuals entered the marrow-cleansing pool and were ambushed by malicious companions, losing their blood’s spiritual power…”</p>
<p>Her words seemed caring towards Xue Ranran, but they were filled with dangerous implications—The *present Mu Qingge, although her spiritual power had greatly increased, still couldn’t fully control it. Her blood was full of abundant spiritual power, essentially a human Vermilion Bird. If someone drank her blood, it would be akin to advancing in the marrow-cleansing pool.<br/>( <em>novel maybe a little confusing because we as readers know that Mu Qingge is Xue Ranran but to the characters, Mu Ranwu is Mu Qingge</em> )</p>
<p>Indeed, as soon as these words were spoken, including Weifang who just stood up, their expressions subtly changed, their gazes towards Ranran becoming peculiar.</p>
<p>They had paid a great price on their journey here, and to end up empty-handed now, how could they leave contentedly?</p>
<p>…If what that Mu Qingge said was true, then drinking Xue Ranran’s blood might be an opportunity to turn it all around.</p>
<p>Thinking this way, the two sisters Bingqing and Yujie also exchanged glances that only they understood.</p>
<p>Ranran immediately sensed the subtle changes in these few people. Elder Mu was really formidable with her words, stirring up murderous intent and evil thoughts in the remaining ones with just a few sentences.</p>
<p>If they joined forces, Ranran wasn’t sure if she could easily defeat them right now. But she wasn’t afraid; she had never seen a ferocious beast in the forest pause to hunt when a fire was raging, so she just needed to divert their attention.</p>
<p>As the group slowly closed in, Ranran kindly alerted them, “Fellow Taoists, another person has also entered the marrow-cleansing pool this time, it’s Gui Baqian, and also… have you noticed, Gui Baqian is actually the demon lord Wei Jiu in disguise!”</p>
<p>As expected, the faces of the crowd paled, but the sharp-eyed Ranran noticed that Mu Qingge had remained calm, seemingly unsurprised.</p>
<p>Ranran continued, “So before Wei Jiu catches up, let’s hurry down the mountain!”</p>
<p>After speaking, Ranran grabbed her senior brother, preparing to leave first.</p>
<p>However, the twin sisters from Kongshan sect suddenly used earth techniques, trapping her feet. Wen Bingqing smiled, “Tianmai Mountain is so vast. If what you said is true, that Gui Baqian is Wei Jiu, if he intends to chase us, how can we escape? Only by working together can we repel the demon… How about this, Miss Xue, you share some spiritual blood with us, so we can also become your right-hand men and defeat the demon Wei Jiu together!”</p>
<p>In Wen Bingqing’s view, Ranran giving some blood, not harming her life, and benefiting everyone, why wouldn’t she do it?</p>
<p>The others’ eyes lit up upon hearing this, finding it very reasonable.</p>
<p>Ranran was speechless, realizing another life lesson—although animals don’t kill each other when fleeing in panic, she was facing… humans! Some people were worse than animals; in times of danger, they would do unthinkable and despicable things…</p>
<p>Gao Cang was infuriated by Wen Bingqing’s nonsense and immediately retorted, “You’re talking nonsense! Why don’t you share your thick skin? My junior sister entered the marrow-cleansing pool based on her abilities. Why should she share her hard-earned spiritual power with you?”</p>
<p>But thick-skinned people were everywhere. Ranran noticed that the positions of these few people had changed, forming a circle around her and her senior brother. If they acted together, it would indeed be difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>Weifang considered himself righteous, always speaking honourably. He also smiled superficially and said, “Miss Wen is right. Miss Xue wouldn’t watch others die. You just need to give some blood, which can save so many people. I believe your master will be pleased with you.”</p>
<p>Ranran couldn’t be bothered with these self-righteous people and pulled her senior brother to leave.</p>
<p>However, Wen’s sisters jumped up to block them, and Weifang drew his sword, intending to cut Ranran’s wrist. But before they could approach, Ranran deftly dodged and swept out with a mechanism stick, sending the Wen sisters flying.</p>
<p>Seeing them fly out like kites with broken strings, Ranran was also dumbfounded. She used to rely on tricks like running away, deceiving, and swindling when fighting with others, never directly confronting them.</p>
<p>She had no idea that, after coming out of the marrow-cleansing pool, her strength had such lethality.</p>
<p>The techniques Su Yishui had taught her before could not be used due to the lack of spiritual power, but now they surged in her mind. The subsequent battle was overwhelmingly one-sided. In just a few rounds, the Wen sisters and Weifang couldn’t no longer get back up.</p>
<p>Gao Cang didn’t expect that he hadn’t even acted, yet his junior sister easily won. He couldn’t help but laugh heartily, “With you bunch of amateurs, even if you were given spiritual blood, it wouldn’t save you!”</p>
<p>At this moment, Xue Ranran looked at Mu Qingge, who had been provoking others earlier. She hadn’t acted until now, just watching them fight coldly.</p>
<p>Only after Xue Ranran won decisively did she smile faintly, “Congratulations, Miss Xue, after entering the marrow-cleansing pool, you have indeed been transformed.”</p>
<p>Ranran used to have some good feelings towards Elder Mu. Although her reputation wasn’t good, she was someone who followed her feelings, which suited Ranran’s taste.</p>
<p>But in their recent dealings with Mu Qingge, Ranran started to feel… dislike towards her, feeling that she was similar to those hypocrites from Jiuhua Sect.</p>
<p>Thinking this, Xue Ranran exuded a full-on jianghu fighter’s aura and clasped her fists, “Elder Mu, there are no more people to fool now. Are you prepared to compete with me in literary or martial arts?”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Mu Ranwu had been silently estimating Xue Ranran’s current strength by the side.</p>
<p>Ranran was originally an immature fruit lacking innate spiritual force, so Mu Ranwu, after verifying her identity, did not feel it was a pressing matter.</p>
<p>After all, it was her who had assumed Mu Qingge’s identity, inheriting most of the past-life spiritual powers, and being favored by the Emperor.</p>
<p>She still had the Grudge water poison in her, so why bother annoying Su Yishui and picking on Xue Ranran, a useless person?</p>
<p>But what was so unexpected, was how blessed Xue Ranran’s life turned out to be, right? She actually managed to break through the trial levels with her mediocre spiritual power and finally got the opportunity to enter the pool.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu had planned everything meticulously, but she failed to factor in Xue Ranran’s damned good luck.</p>
<p>Just now, she had silently estimated that Ranran’s current spiritual power was not inferior to her own. If they were to fight head-on, it would be another fierce battle.</p>
<p>However, Xue Ranran said she had no one useful left? That wasn’t necessarily true!</p>
<p>Thinking this, Mu Ranwu smiled faintly and said loudly, “Wei Jiu, come out! Didn’t you ask me last night if I would spend the night with you? Well, your chance is here. Let’s see if you can seize it?”</p>
<p>With her words, a somewhat familiar arrogant laughter came from the nearby tall tree, “Mu Qingge, the little girl is right. Why do you always order others around now, but not step up yourself?”</p>
<p>As she spoke, Wei Jiu jumped down from the tree, staring keenly at Mu Qingge.</p>
<p>It had been twenty years since he last saw this woman. So when Wei Jiu got the chance last night, he couldn’t wait to sit next to Mu Qingge and do some catching up.</p>
<p>At first, when Wen Hongshan found him and stated directly that it was at Mu Qingge’s request, to retrieve that key.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu had thought Wen Hongshan could be a useful pawn, so he proposed that Wen Hongshan find a way to help him infiltrate the marrow-cleansing pool Meet.</p>
<p>This Meet had always been controlled by their righteous faction, so a demonic cultivator like Wei Jiu naturally could never enter. Moreover, Tianmai Mountain was within the territory of the righteous faction, making it difficult to assail.</p>
<p>In the past, Wei Jiu had no interest in this paltry amount of cultivation, but after losing most of his core, he naturally had to find a way to make up for it. That’s when he remembered about the marrow-cleansing pool.</p>
<p>What righteous disciples, they were just a bunch of hypocrites wrapped in human skin.</p>
<p>That Wen Hongshan wasn’t a decent woman either, so Wei Jiu appealed to her interests, suggesting that during the heavenly tribulation, he would help her get rid of her mentor, making it easier for her to take control of the sect.</p>
<p>Every sect had unique divine treasures, and without being the sect leader, it was hard to use these things to further one’s cultivation.</p>
<p>If Abbess Wen still could not ascend and continue to occupy the sect leader’s position for decades more, Wen Hongshan would then be unable to use those treasures for herself, and probably become anxious.</p>
<p>After hesitating for a long time, Wen Hongshan finally agreed.</p>
<p>Thus, the deal was struck. Wei Jiu used some means to make Abbess Wen pass away convincingly during the heavenly tribulation.</p>
<p>With Wen Hongshan’s help, he took on the identity of a Kongshan sect disciple and smoothly blended into Tianmai Mountain.</p>
<p>However, in Wei Jiu’s critical eyes, why did Mu Qingge look slightly inferior after her rebirth?….. Although her features were similar, she lacked the wildness and carefree spirit she had before.</p>
<p>Actually, what was most alluring about Mu Qingge in her previous life had been her unbridled free spirit. Every time Wei Jiu imagined completely subduing this woman, getting her beneath him, his blood surged, as if possessed by a demon.</p>
<p>But then again she was now reborn as a young girl, so naturally, there would be some changes in appearance.</p>
<p>Last night, he teased her with words, but she only smiled without responding, which was more pleasing than her previous indifference to him in her past life.</p>
<p>Now, she unexpectedly brought up his flirting from last night. Wei Jiu raised his eyebrows in surprise.</p>
<p>Hearing Wei Jiu’s mocking words, Mu Ranwu smiled slightly, raised her chin elegantly, and did not avoid Wei Jiu’s impudent gaze. She said softly, “You poisoned me with the Grudge water, didn’t you anticipate that I would eventually come to you to detoxify? But now, although you have entered the marrow-cleansing pool, you have ultimately shared the spiritual power of the pool. Even if I wanted to rely on you, I’m afraid you don’t have the ability to detoxify me…”</p>
<p>Her method of fanning the flames are just as effective. As long as there was greed in people’s hearts, they would knowingly walk into traps.</p>
<p>Ranran thought to herself: Not good!</p>
<p>Sure enough, Wei Jiu turned his gaze towards Xue Ranran and said with a big smile, “Your Grandmaster is right. I don’t want her to suffer too much either. If I had more spiritual power, maybe I could help her to detoxify quicker. Do you want to take the initiative? I promise to cleanly break your neck when the time comes, without letting you feel any pain.”</p>
<p>Gao Cang yelled in anger, “My junior sister is not a nutritious soup, for you all to divide among yourselves!”</p>
<p>After saying that, he prepared to rush forward and fight them to the death. But before he could reach them, Ranran was a step ahead of him. She grabbed him and threw her senior brother to the other side of the broken bridge.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu had just entered the pool of darkness, rapidly improving his cultivation level. Gao Cang rashly attacking would be like hitting a rock with an egg.</p>
<p>“Senior Brother, you go down the mountain quickly and inform the Second Uncle Master and the others that Wei Jiu is here, so they need to prepare quickly!”</p>
<p>Gao Cang understood that with Wei Jiu here, perhaps disciples of the Crimson Gate were also present, making it very dangerous for those below the mountain. Thinking this, he knew he couldn’t help here and quickly ran down the mountain to inform them.</p>
<p>However, when he reached halfway down the mountain and looked back, he found that Wei Fang and the others had also come down the mountain. He couldn’t help but shout in urgently, “Why did you all come down? Leaving only my junior sister to fight the demon alone?”</p>
<p>It turned out that after Ranran threw Gao Cang over just now, Wei Fang and the others also asked Ranran to find a way to send them over.</p>
<p>Ranran was confronting Wei Jiu and couldn’t be bothered to throw them one by one, so she wrapped the fishing line from her pocket around a copper coin. With just a gentle toss, she shot the coin into the cliff on the opposite side.</p>
<p>So they all used light body techniques to step on the fishing line and cross the valley, catching up with Gao Cang along the way.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Gao Cang’s question, Wei Fang’s face didn’t change as he said without shame, “We haven’t entered the marrow-cleansing pool, so how can we be Wei Jiu’s opponents? Of course, we came down to call for reinforcements!”</p>
<p>“Aiyah!” Gao Cang stomped his foot in frustration and turned to run back up the mountain. However, he wasn’t proficient in light body techniques, so he couldn’t step on the fishing line to cross the valley. He could only watch as his little junior sister fought Wei Jiu alone.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, Xue Ranran, after everyone left, wielded her mechanical staff and engaged in a fight with Wei Jiu.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu, who had been ridiculed by this girl as neither a man nor a woman just now, was truly annoyed. Remembering how she had made a fool of him so many times before, even if Mu Qingge didn’t say anything to provoke him, he definitely already wanted to kill this brat!</p>
<p>However, seeing those righteous disciples who were clamoring to divide her spiritual blood just now, how they have all fled at lightning speed, Wei Jiu couldn’t help but laugh while fighting.</p>
<p>“You little brat, you’re the only one left. Look, those so-called righteous people don’t care about you at all. Even if you die, no one will collect your corpse. You’ll just become a pile of bones in the wilderness. I’m someone who values talent. If you’re willing, I’ll overlook the past and accept you under my wing. How about it?”</p>
<p>But Ranran wouldn’t have it! She heard that Wei Jiu had very few female disciples, and it seemed that even the female Elder was also his woman. If she fell into the hands of this lecherous demon, her innocence would be in danger!</p>
<p>Now that she was evenly matched with him and could handle his attacks with ease, her confidence soared. So, while fighting, she made faces at him and said, “To be my master, you need to be as handsome as a celestial! Look at you, do you think you are as handsome as my Shifu?”</p>
<p>This was the second time Wei Jiu had heard someone say he wasn’t as good-looking as Su Yishui. This hit another sore spot for Wei Jiu, his phoenix eyes widened with anger and his expression became savage.</p>
<p>“Ugly freak, how dare you mock me for being ugly? Watch how I crush you into pieces, and see if your master even recognizes you after that!”</p>
<p>After saying this, Wei Jiu didn’t hold back and started to attack mercilessly, intending to kill this sharp-tongued girl within a few moves.</p>
<p>Ranran was nearly hit several times by him, and her newly gained confidence dipped. While she could handle people like Wei Fang and the others easily, facing a high-level demonic cultivator like Wei Jiu was still beyond her.</p>
<p>After trying to block a few moves, Ranran’s hands were numb from the impact. She dared not resist head-on anymore and relied on her agile movements to dodge around Wei Jiu.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, she was now alone, and she didn’t know how long she could hold out. If she fell into Wei Jiu’s hands, it probably wouldn’t be as simple as draining a few sips of blood.</p>
<p>Considering Wei Jiu’s cruelty, what he said was likely true… Thinking of this, Ranran couldn’t afford to relax and focused all her attention on dealing with Wei Jiu.</p>
<p>But just then, a cold light flashed past and stabbed straight towards Ranran’s chest.</p>
<p>Ranran looked down and gasped. A short arrow, as thick as a chopstick, was lodged right in her chest, causing her to grimace in pain.</p>
<p>Ranran took a few steps back, swiftly pulled out the hidden arrow, and angrily shouted at Elder Mu who shot it, “What are you doing? Shooting arrows in secret?”</p>
<p>Luckily, Ranran was wearing the soft silver armor made by Uncle Master Zeng, so the arrow boosted by spiritual power only caused her some pain but didn’t penetrate her skin.</p>
<p>Shifu had told Ranran before, that it was not true that Uncle Master Zeng had no cultivation skills at all. It was just that he took the path of craftsmanship, so when he concentrated on making weapons, the items themselves were imbued by the spirit power of the craftsman, becoming extraordinary artifacts. The same principle applied to other weapons crafting, making them a different kind of cultivation.</p>
<p>So, even a small soft silver armor was enough to resist a hidden arrow imbued in spiritual power.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu also didn’t expect that her well-planned ambush failed. She didn’t know what Ranran was wearing, but it seemed that she was impervious to weapons.</p>
<p>Although Wei Jiu was difficult to deal with, Mu Ranwu felt that Xue Ranran was a greater threat to her.</p>
<p>With no one else present, Mu Ranwu didn’t need to pretend to be friendly anymore. Seeing her ambush fail, she was ready to rush up and join forces with Wei Jiu, first eliminating Ranran, this unpredictable loose end.</p>
<p>But little did she know that when she rushed over, she was knocked back by Wei Jiu’s palm.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu was somewhat astonished, while Wei Jiu sneered, “Are you mocking me for not being able to deal with even a little girl? Do you need to come help me?”</p>
<p>Men’s pride could be strange at times, generally summed up as: they don’t allow others to mock their incompetence.</p>
<p>This implication of “incompetence” could make a man furious, be it in bed or out of it!</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu obviously didn’t consider Wei Jiu’s pride, inadvertently highlighting his inadequacies.</p>
<p>Seeing that Wei Jiu wouldn’t let her intervene, she could only step back and watch Wei Jiu show off in front of a little girl.</p>
<p>Just as Ranran was being forced back by Wei Jiu again, the dense forest nearby started to shake. Suddenly, the small white tiger leaped out of the forest, clawing straight at Wei Jiu’s face.</p>
<p>It was too fast. Wei Jiu couldn’t dodge in time and was deeply scratched by the small claws.</p>
<p>In an instant, the small white tiger’s body suddenly grew larger, emitting a deafening roar.</p>
<p>The Geng jin White Tiger seemed to have regained some strength and could finally reveal its true form.</p>
<p>Ranran was overjoyed and quickly changed her stance, cooperating with the Geng jin white tiger to confront Wei Jiu together.</p>
<p>The white tiger seemed to have observed Ranran and the others practice their formation often and it could position itself accurately. Despite being the first time teaming up with Ranran, it seemed to anticipate Ranran’s moves, creating openings for her each time she shifted her position.</p>
<p>Their coordination was seamless.</p>
<p>Even though they were only a duo and couldn’t form a “pin” formation, their swift movements were actually even more effective than the coordination with Gao Cang and Qiu Xier!</p>
<p>Ranran knew the most crucial thing at that moment was to disrupt Wei Jiu’s attack rhythm. She focused her mind, using long-range attacks with her staff and close-range strikes with her fist hooks, while leaping and switching positions with the White Tiger to fight Wei Jiu. They managed to inflict several new wounds on Wei Jiu many times.</p>
<p>The White Tiger’s attacks were also ferocious, even rearing up on its hind legs a few times, with its sharp teeth and tiger claws landing their strikes without missing.</p>
<p>After several rounds, Wei Jiu lost his advantage, covered in wounds and gradually losing ground.</p>
<p>Having soaked in the Black Pool, he had pursued quick gains, which resulted in a surge of spiritual power but also came with drawbacks. Without a period of adjustment, he couldn’t fully unleash this sudden increase in power.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that after Su Yi Shui absorbed more than half of Wei Jiu’s core, he had also gone into seclusion for over a month to recuperate.</p>
<p>Seeing himself besieged by Ranran and the white tiger, Wei Jiu couldn’t exert his full strength and started to falter.</p>
<p>His manly pride suddenly meant little to him. Wei Jiu couldn’t help but shout at Mu Qingge, who was leisurely watching the spectacle, “Didn’t you want her spiritual blood? Why aren’t you helping? Should I deliver her to your mouth?”</p>
<p>But Mu Ranwu just sneered; she could already see that Wei Jiu was struggling.</p>
<p>However, she didn’t comply with Wei Jiu’s wishes to join forces against their enemy.</p>
<p>The white tiger was too ferocious, its spiritual powers seemingly even more powerful compared to when it fought alongside her sister in her past life. Mu Ranwu cherished her chance of reincarnation dearly and would not allow any scars on her flawless skin.</p>
<p>In such a conflict where both sides would suffer great losses, regardless of who dies, she would be glad of it!</p>
<p>She carefully manipulated Wen Hongshan, saw through Wei Jiu’s intentions, and led him all the way here just to eliminate Wei Jiu in one fell swoop, so that she could avoid being under his control again!</p>

<p>Of course, Mu Ranwu had originally planned to secure her qualification to enter the pool first, then use the isolation characteristics of Tianmai Mountain against Wei Jiu. But she never expected that Xue Ranran would also enter Tianmai Mountain unexpectedly. In the end, she was like a blind cat who ran into a dead rat, and even won.</p>
<p>However, this was even better. If Wei Jiu and Xue Ranran could both perish together, then she would have no more future troubles!</p>
<p>Did Su Yishui think he was the only one who knew how to get rid of the poison?</p>
<p>Thinking that she might soon be able to detoxify the Grudge water poison, a faint smile of joy appeared on Mu Ranwu’s face…</p>
<p>Just as Wei Jiu called out to her again, Mu Ranwu snorted coldly, threw the last mysterious clay pill into a nearby gully, closed her eyes suddenly, silently chanted a spell to catalyze the clay pill, and then flew down the mountain.</p>
<p>The matter of Wei Jiu appearing in Tianmai Mountain must not be leaked out; otherwise, the conspiracy between her and Wen Hongshan would inevitably be exposed. So Mu Ranwu had to intercept them before Gao Cang and Wei Fang descends the mountain.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Mu Ranwu moved extremely fast, leaping over the suspension bridge in a few bounds, and chased after Wei Fang and the others.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran caught a glimpse of Elder Mu throwing the clay pill and remembered seeing her do something similar in the vision of Medicine Immortal. She couldn’t help but feel some doubt. Elder Mu had thrown so many clay pills; it couldn’t it be that she found carrying them cumbersome and obstructive?</p>
<p>Just then, she saw red mist rising from where the clay pill had fallen.</p>
<p>The White Tiger, entangled with Wei Jiu, suddenly let out a roar, at the same time it used its body to nudge Ranran, as if urging her to leave quickly. It was going to hold the rear for her.</p>
<p>Ranran had a bad feeling, but it was already too late to leave the mountain. The red mist spread rapidly, and the clay pills scattered around seemed to burst open, gradually releasing the mist.</p>
<p>When Ranran heard buzzing sounds, she realized that this “red mist” was actually densely packed red flying insects.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu also jumped back right then, no longer entangled in the fight. He quickly surveyed the area and immediately muttered, “This is bad!”</p>
<p>These insects initially looked like sesame seeds, but they seemed to grow rapidly in the wind, quickly reaching the size of soybeans. In the blink of an eye, the entire mountain was covered with them.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu seemed to recognize these insects and his fair face began to darken with anger. “Immortal Devouring Bugs! Has Mu Qingge lost her mind? She actually summoned these things!”</p>
<p>These red insects seemed to have a common target and they all rushed towards Wei Jiu, Ranran, and the white tiger.</p>
<p>Ranran quickly wielded her mechanical staff, creating a vortex of airflow to block the insects.</p>
<p>However, one or two still landed on her arms and neck.</p>
<p>In the instant they bit her, Ranran felt her arms and neck go numb, and at the same time, her just replenished dantian suddenly felt uncomfortable, as if being drained of spiritual energy.</p>
<p>Just then, the white tiger swiftly pounced toward Ranran, using its body to surround her and blocking the first wave of attacks from the red insects.</p>
<p>Ranran buried her face in the soft fur of the white tiger. She heard the white tiger’s whimpers of pain in her ear. These red insects were just as formidable even when biting divine beasts.</p>
<p>These Immortal Devouring Bugs were not creatures of the mortal realm; they live on devouring spiritual energy. Their sharp mouths could penetrate flesh and bone, and once they targeted someone, they would continuously drain their spiritual energy.</p>
<p>At the moment when the White Tiger shielded Ranran, its body was immediately covered with a layer of red insects. Fortunately, it had thick fur, which temporarily resisted them.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of this moment, the white tiger half stood up and whispered in Ranran’s ear in human language, “Hold on to me, I’m going into the water!”</p>
<p>Ranran was startled by what the white tiger said by her ear because that deep voice… was clearly her Shifu, Su Yishui!</p>
<p>With no time to think, Ranran quickly grabbed the fur on its belly. The white tiger then jumped into the deep valley under the snake bridge in a flying leap.</p>
<p>Before jumping down, Ranran caught a glimpse of Wei Jiu igniting True Fire to burn those insects. Initially effective, Wei Jiu’s True Fire was also fueled by spiritual energy. Dealing with these weird insects that feasted on marrow and essence, it was apparent that this was a futile attempt.</p>
<p>Although many of the insects were burned to death, even more insects swarmed in, and they managed to suppress the flames in Wei Jiu’s palm. Soon, Wei Jiu’s body was covered in a layer of red insects, looking extremely creepy!</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t know what happened next because she and the white tiger had plunged into the deep valley. The valley was very deep, and after falling for what seemed a very long time, they finally fell heavily into deep water.</p>
<p>Immediately afterward, Wei Jiu, who was screaming from being bitten, also jumped down. The tremendous impact of entering the water temporarily dispersed the Immortal Devouring Bugs covering his body.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these Immortal Devouring Bugs had already tasted the deliciousness of absorbing spiritual energy and were rushing towards the water, seemingly unafraid of it.</p>
<p>After Wei Jiu entered the water, he saw that the White Tiger was leading Ranran toward a cave below the water pool, so he hurriedly followed.</p>
<p>It turned out that the cave under the water pool was connected to another cave. After passing through a water passage, they climbed into the cave.</p>
<p>Ranran was the only one of the three who hadn’t been severely bitten, so her strength was still considerable. She quickly used her spiritual energy to move a huge rock and blocked the only entrance.</p>
<p>Ranran exerted force to tightly seal the rock, temporarily cutting off the pursuit of those insects.</p>
<p>In the pitch-black darkness, Wei Jiu used his palm to ignite fire and illuminated the surroundings, astonishingly finding that this place was actually a bedroom-like house, complete with beds, shelves, and books.</p>
<p>As they entered the house, there was no need to light a lamp; the surroundings became bright on their own, with sunlight streaming in through the windows. Colorful butterflies danced playfully in front of the peony flowers outside the window, and the faint sounds of a children playing with their mother could be heard.</p>
<p>Ranran could still smell the dampness of the water cave, and her body couldn’t feel the warmth of the sunlight. She blinked and immediately understood, “Is this……all an illusion?”</p>
<p>Just like when she mistakenly entered the Medicine Immortal’s medicine field farmhouse before, this should also be an illusion formed from memories. She just didn’t know which immortal left his memories forgotten here.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu was now sitting slumped on the ground, his body covered in wounds from fending off the insects. He felt weak all over and vigilantly watched Ranran to see if she had any intentions of attacking him.</p>
<p>Seeing that Ranran didn’t come over, he spoke, “This should be a memory sealed by a great Cultivator like Dun Tian. It is said that when a great Cultivator ascends, they have to let go of worldly attachments, so they seal their memories somewhere. They can return occasionally in the future to have a look if they wanted.”</p>
<p>Ranran found his explanation reasonable. In Dun Tian’s memories, there seemed to be a woman and a child, indicating that he had already started a family before becoming immortal…</p>
<p>Just then, a shout came from outside the window, “Husband, it’s time for dinner!”</p>
<p>Followed by a string of giggles from a child, “Father, if you don’t come soon, Bao’er will eat all the chicken legs!”</p>
<p>But the door remained unopened, and the calls were repeated over and over…</p>
<p>Before long, a bird with red feathers and a crescent-shaped white fluff around its neck flew in, hopping around the window.</p>
<p>Then, a woman’s voice singing a lullaby to put a child to sleep came from outside. The voice was as gentle as a meandering stream… The little bird also seemed to be enchanted by the song, curling up into a small fluffy ball, quietly tilting its head to listen.</p>
<p>Perhaps, before Dun Tian ascended, what he couldn’t bear to part with the most was his wife and child. However, in this deliberately sealed memory, he could only hear their voices and never saw their faces.</p>
<p>What made him unable to even dare to look at his wife and child’s faces in his memories?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>She didn’t have time to think about it any further. She quickly crouched down to check the white tiger’s injuries. When they entered the water earlier, the insects on the white tiger had been shaken off, leaving behind numerous wounds that dyed its fur red.</p>
<p>Her heart aching, Ranran hugged it lovingly and softly petted its head. She then took out a small medicine pouch from her pocket. Although the medicines inside were damp, they could still be used. She applied them to the white tiger, hoping to alleviate its pain and make it more comfortable.</p>
<p>Just now, she was certain that she wasn’t hallucinating; this tiger did speak, and it used her Shifu’s voice. What was going on? Was her Shifu a Tiger spirit?</p>
<p>His appearance was indeed somewhat different from an ordinary mortal. If he was actually transformed from a demon, it was also very possible… After all, Fox spirits and the like were very seductive…</p>
<p>At this moment, the tiger raised its eyes slightly, and its cold gaze on her was exactly like her Shifu’s!</p>
<p>Ranran suddenly realized something. No wonder she felt something was off when she looked at the white tiger these past two days. It was because the little tiger had seemed inexplicably majestic and dignified.</p>
<p>Ranran thought of these past few days when she cuddled, rubbed her face on and petted the white tiger, even scratching its belly… She suddenly felt troubled!</p>
<p><em>Shifu! Please believe me, I’m not lusting after your beauty and intentionally outraging your modesty!</em></p>
<p>Just then, Su Yishui’s cold voice sounded in her ear again, “There’s a gold talisman I have given you in your pocket. Stick it on Wei Jiu. If you want to get out of here, you’ll need to use him. You can’t kill him for now.”</p>
<p>Ranran blinked and noticed that the nearby Wei Jiu didn’t seem to hear the white tiger speak.</p>
<p>She understood now. Her Shifu was using a technique which can direct his voice to a specific target, so apparently only she could hear him.</p>
<p>As for Wei Jiu, he sat on one side, meditating and recuperating. He was injured while fighting Ranran and the white tiger earlier, and later he was heavily bitten by the Immortal Devouring Bugs. He needed to recuperate well. Fortunately, not much of his spiritual energy was absorbed, and the white tiger was heavily injured protecting the little girl and lost its spiritual power, so there was nothing to fear with only Ranran left!</p>
<p>As for Mu Qingge……there was no need to wait for the backlash of the Black Pool to end his affection. He couldn’t wait to capture her and break her neck right this moment……He had already returned the key and the soul oath with Su Yishui has been nullified, so killing Mu Qingge should not be a problem…</p>
<p>He was just thinking this, when suddenly he felt someone approaching. Before he could react, a golden talisman was pressed against his cheek.</p>
<p>Even Ranran didn’t expect that she could stick that talisman so smoothly. She had just tried it casually and didn’t expect Wei Jiu to not even dodge, and she just stuck it on like that.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu glared with rounded phoenix eyes, gritting his teeth as he said, “Remove the talisman. What kind of righteous path would use this sneak attack?”</p>
<p>Rangran breathed a sigh of relief, half-squatting and staring at Wei Jiu with big eyes. She smiled bashfully, “I really can’t beat you, so I might as well stick a talisman on you. Let’s both calm down and think about how to get out of this predicament?”</p>
<p>What Wei Jiu regret the most at this moment, was refusing Mu Qingge’s assistance just now and not killing this little brat together earlier.</p>
<p>However, he’s at a disadvantaged position now. Although he had entered the Black Pool, which could expedite his cultivation, he had lost a lot of spiritual energy to the Immortal Devouring Bugs. Now his dantian was somewhat empty, and he needed to gather his Qi again to recover.</p>
<p>Thinking about this, he didn’t want to provoke the little girl and force her hand, so he said coldly, “Only I know how to solve the problem of these Immortal Devouring Bugs. If you want to escape, you’ll have to rely on my help!”</p>
<p>The meaning behind his words was to inform Xue Ranran not to try harming him at this time. If she killed him, she would also perish, trapped in the cave.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran sincerely expressed that the Demon Lord was worrying too much. However, if he could make a soul oath with her, guaranteeing not to harm her and the White Tiger, she would gladly remove the talisman for the Demon Lord.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu snorted coldly and did not agree, instead closing his eyes to meditate.</p>
<p>As Xue Ranran had temporarily taken care of that demon, she allowed herself to relax a bit. However, since this was an illusion and there were no real beds, she let the tiger lie on her legs, so that it could be more comfortable.</p>
<p>But the present Gengjin white tiger was not the small cat it used to be. Its large head resting on her legs felt quite heavy.</p>
<p>However, it would seem that due to its injuries, its now acting a little spoiled. When Ranran called it, its eyes remained half-closed but continued to silently snuggle into Ranran’s arms.</p>
<p>Thinking that this might be her Shifu, Ranran suddenly felt a bit at a loss. Just then, the voice of Su Yishui echoed in her ear again: “I used Beast Control Technique to connect my spirit with the White Tiger. However, now the White Tiger’s spiritual energy is dissipating too quickly. I don’t know if I can continue to control it. You should take the time to meditate and make the best use of the spiritual energy you just attained. Although those Immortal Devouring Bugs are domineering, they also have weaknesses. Every sun set, they will lose the yang energy that sustains them, and their activity will greatly decline. At that time, you can tell Wei Jiu to clear the way with True Fire, and you should be able to rush down the mountain…”</p>
<p>When Shifu spoke these words, his voice sounded somewhat weak. Ranran understood that the Beast Control Technique meant merging one’s own spirit with a spiritual beast. Now that the white tiger’s body was covered in wounds, it also meant that Shifu who was controlling the white tiger was also injured to some extent.</p>
<p>At this moment, Wei Jiu finally finished meditating and took a deep breath. With a smirk on his handsome face stuck with a talisman, he said, “Little girl, you actually managed to subdue Mu Qingge’s mount, you do have some skills. However, did your master tell you that these wild beasts are unpredictable? They may be affectionate one moment and bite your head off the next?”</p>
<p>Ranran thought for a moment and honestly replied, “Shifu didn’t say that. He just told us to be wary of you members of the Crimson Gate Sect. But I don’t think you’re as bad as my Shifu described. At least you have some skills and look quite manly in a duel, which is much better than the disciples of the Jiuhua Sect…”</p>
<p>Because she would need his help later, Ranran decided to say something flattering and stroke this demon’s smelly ego.</p>
<p>Her words made Wei Jiu quite pleased. He raised an eyebrow and agreed, “How can those hypocritical fellows compare to me?”</p>
<p>However, the white tiger in Ranran’s arms seemed to disapprove of her insincere words. It raised its head slightly and stared at her with its big tiger eyes.</p>
<p>Ranran stuck out her tongue. Out of habit, she reached out and scratched the White Tiger’s chin, and the White Tiger couldn’t control its own instinct and turned its body to let Ranran continue scratching its chin.</p>
<p>..<em>.Shifu, your disciple really didn’t mean to…</em></p>
<p>But at this moment, she could not tell whether it was the white tiger or her Shifu, who was looking at her with squinted eyes, and seemed to be waiting persistently for a comfortable scritch.</p>
<p>Ranran had no choice but to continue scratching the tiger’s chin.</p>
<p>And she had to continue bantering with Wei Jiu to ease the previously tense killing atmosphere: “Excellency Wei, now there are Immortal Devouring Bugs outside, and we can’t stay trapped here forever. Do you have any ideas?”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu snorted coldly, “Mu Qingge is deliberately plotting against me. But where did she get so many Immortal Devouring Bugs? These insects parasitize on the decayed corpses of Demon Mountain, and it usually takes twenty years for them to mature. Without careful nurturing, they cannot spread so rapidly under sunlight…”</p>
<p>Ranran understood the meaning behind Wei Jiu’s words. It had been less than a year since Mu Qingge fell from the tree. She would not have had the time to find these rare poisonous insects, let alone cultivate them personally.</p>
<p>So who gave Mu Qingge those insects? This was probably something that they could only find out from Elder Mu.</p>
<p>What Ranran was more worried about was whether these insects would spread from Tianmai Mountain and affect her Second Uncle Master and the others down the mountain.</p>
<p>At this point, Wei Jiu took a breath and slowly opened his eyes, carefully observing the pensive little girl in front of him.</p>
<p>To be fair, although she wasn’t a beauty as stunning as Mu Qingge, her features were delicate, especially her lively eyes. The longer one looked , she would became more pleasing to the eye.</p>
<p>As Wei Jiu squinted his eyes looking at her, he suddenly noticed that the White Tiger had raised its head alertly, blocking his impudent gaze that had been scrutinizing Ranran.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu snorted coldly, this inconsiderate beast, did it think he was interested in that ugly girl?</p>
<p>Although he had been tagged with a talisman, he wasn’t in a hurry because he knew that once he restored his true qi, he would naturally be able to break the seal of the talisman. He decided to let the little girl feel smug for a while…</p>
<p>As Wei Jiu was thinking this, suddenly another golden talisman slapped onto his forehead – Ranran retracted her hand and said with a shy smile, “Excellency Wei, your cultivation is too profound. You won’t mind if I put another one?”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu’s true qi, which had finally gathered, was scattered in an instant. He grinned with gritted teeth and said, “Xue… Ranran, right? You only asked after you already stuck it on, isn’t that quite unnecessary?”</p>
<p>Ranran wanted to say something else, but the White Tiger behind her used its mouth to tug at her clothes, indicating that she should stay away from Wei Jiu.</p>
<p>“No need to waste words with him. In order to stay alive, he’ll definitely cooperate with you… Scratch my back, the wounds are a little painful…”</p>
<p>After hearing her Shifu’s covert message, Ranran quickly continued massaging the White Tiger’s back. Then she obediently followed her master’s instructions and stopped talking to Wei Jiu, focusing on meditating instead.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Since coming out of the marrow-cleansing pool, she had felt her dantian qi surging violently, requiring her to meditate every now and then.</p>
<p>Seeing that Wei Jiu also closed his eyes and remained silent, it seemed that he was doing the same.</p>
<p>After a while, Ranran entered the realm of clarity. Even though she had crossed the stone wall and the pool water, she could still clearly hear the sounds from the world outside.</p>
<p>The buzzing sound of the red insects continued unabated. She didn’t know if senior brother had made it down the mountain in time to avoid this insect calamity…</p>
<p>Just then, Wei Jiu suddenly spoke again, “Little girl, I’m willing to make a soul oath, but you also have to swear that you’ll remove the golden talismans for me.”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu had tried several times just now, but he couldn’t break the talismans’ seal with his true qi. He didn’t know where she got it from; it seemed to be the handiwork of a skilled talisman maker.</p>
<p>Since he couldn’t break it, Wei Jiu could only accept Ranran’s proposal. However, he kept his guard up; he would only swear not to harm her on Tianmai Mountain. Once they were out of Tianmai Mountain, he would deal with her then.</p>
<p>Ranran nodded in agreement. After they both made their oaths, Ranran went over and removed the talismans from Wei Jiu’s face.</p>
<p>The moment the talisman was removed, Wei Jiu suddenly reached out and grabbed Ranran’s wrist, pulling her into his arms. Ranran didn’t panic. She blinked her big eyes and reminded the Demon Lord, “Um… the consequences of breaking a soul oath are quite tragic…”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu’s hand that was holding her wrist suddenly moved slightly: this girl’s skin is really delicate, just a touch feels like soft jade…</p>
<p>Before he could move his fingers to stroke her skin again, the tiger suddenly let out a deafening roar of anger and pounced towards him.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu quickly let go and dodged. He had forgotten that he had sworn not to harm this beast, but the beast couldn’t swear anything. If he provoked it, he would have to expend his true qi again.</p>
<p>“It was just a hand hold, how does that violate a soul oath? Could it be that you still don’t have a lover and your heart hasn’t opened yet, so you are feeling a little shy?”</p>
<p>Although they weren’t shaking hands anymore, Wei Jiu couldn’t help but tease verbally. However, she was really quite pretty, delicate and charming, with such smooth skin… <em>I wonder if that sanctimonious Su Yishui has had a first taste, savored this little sweet fruit…</em></p>
<p>Ranran didn’t have time to deal with him. She looked bemusedly at the little white tiger licking her wrist. It seemed to think that Wei Jiu had dirtied her hand, so it simply lightly bit down on her wrist with its mouth, making low purring sounds as if it was very unhappy.</p>
<p>Hmm… Although Shifu had merged with the white tiger, he obviously couldn’t control some of the white tiger’s daily habits. This kind of finger-biting game was something the little tiger loved to do on normal days.</p>
<p>After soothing the white tiger, Ranran looked up seriously and said, “Whether my heart has opened or not is not important, but Excellency Wei, you must be starving. If you don’t go out soon, I’m afraid you’ll pass out from hunger in here.”</p>
<p>The reason she said this was because Ranran herself felt very hungry. The sudden surge of true qi, coupled with the movement of her breath, seemed to have stimulated her appetite, and fasting no longer worked.</p>
<p>Sure enough, right after she finished speaking, Wei Jiu’s stomach also rumbled. Ranran took out her snack bag. Although the dried sweet potatoes were a bit damp, they could still stave off hunger.</p>
<p>Seeing Wei Jiu glaring at her, Ranran handed some to him. This time, Wei Jiu didn’t stand on ceremony and finished it all in few bites –<em> this girl’s snacks were quite delicious…</em></p>
<p>When Ranran entered the cave earlier, she had taken out the water droplet hourglass that Uncle Master Zeng had given her, to calculate the time they entered the cave. Now, it seems they had been in the cave for too long.</p>
<p>So Ranran said, “When we entered the water, it was just noon, with intense sunlight, which is when the Immortal Devouring Bugs were most energetic. But now it’s evening, without sunlight, so those Immortal Devouring Bugs won’t be as formidable. We can take this opportunity to break out.”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu didn’t expect that such a young girl would know the weaknesses of these Immortal Devouring Bugs. It really took him by surprise. However, she was right, now was indeed a good time to break out.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>
<p><em>Its so funny when Su Yishui was biting/holding Ranran’s wrist in response to Wei Jiu holding her wrist, but trust Ranran to rationalize it as something the little tiger does with her fingers during play time.</em></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">揭露真相 REVEALING THE TRUTH</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>After Wei Jiu finished eating the pieces of dried sweet potatoes, he felt a bit less hungry.</p>
<p>As he moved the stone blocking the cave entrance, he said, “When we leap out of the water later, I’ll use True Fire to clear the way and drive away the Immortal Devouring Bugs. But if the disciples from the Jiuhua Sect and the Kongshan Sect didn’t make it down the mountain earlier, those Immortal Devouring Bugs should have increased in number due to their spiritual power. It takes a lot of elemental energy to use True Fire. When my true qi can’t keep up later, place your palm against my back to help me sustain the true qi!”</p>
<p>Ranran nodded to indicate she understood. They then followed the secret passage back into the underwater pool and headed upwards.</p>
<p>Before they reached the water’s surface, the buzzing sound grew louder. When they leaped out of the water, they saw that the insects, originally the size of soybeans, had grown to the size of lima beans.</p>
<p>As Wei Jiu had said, the people who did not make it down from the mountain had nourished these red insects with their spiritual power, and since Tianmai Mountain was a place rich in spiritual energy, everything flourished there, making their attack even fiercer.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu, now replenished with true qi, leaped out of the water and ignited a blazing fire, burning the insects.</p>
<p>His true qi made the insects even more frenzied, akin to moths to a flame, coming one after another.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it was already night, so the insects’ speed and strength had noticeably decreased. Ranran used her stick like an oar to smash these insects to pieces.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu ran swiftly while igniting the fire, and Ranran and the White Tiger followed closely behind. Finally, the two of them leaped onto the White Tiger, letting it carry them forward, while Ranran placed her palm against Wei Jiu’s back to sustain his true qi and keep the flames going.</p>
<p>In this way, the two of them, along with the tiger, leaped and dashed forward until they reached halfway down the mountain. As Su Yishui had said, the insects’ attacks in the night were not as fierce.</p>
<p>But sensing the spiritual energy, the surrounding insects still swarmed towards them. A few with wings carrying fire fell on Ranran’s neck, biting her. Perhaps the pain caused her to lose concentration, and Wei Jiu’s fire weakened suddenly.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu gritted his teeth and said, “You! Don’t lose heart!”</p>
<p>However, Ranran was not distracted by the pain. She patted Wei Jiu’s shoulder and said, “Have you noticed that there are no Immortal Devouring Bugs gathered around that tree?”</p>
<p>Following her pointed finger, Wei Jiu indeed saw no trace of Immortal Devouring Bugs around a tall tree.</p>
<p>On that tree sat a large flaming red bird, emitting an orange-red light in the night. This was clearly the Vermilion Bird that Wei Fang and the others had wanted to capture earlier.</p>
<p>At this moment, it was leisurely perched on the tree, tilting its head to look at the two humans and a tiger being chased by a swarm of insects in the night.</p>
<p>The White Tiger beneath them, carried them swiftly towards the tree.</p>
<p>Ranran remembered reading about the Vermilion Bird in her master’s study, from the interesting books of the Immortal Realm, which said that it was a sacred and pure bird that rotten creatures avoided.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu had also mentioned that these insects grew out of the corpses in the Demon Domain, so naturally, they feared the Vermilion Bird…</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Ranran was filled with joy and whispered, “We’re saved!”</p>
<p>When they arrived under the tree, the red insects were indeed wary of the Vermilion Bird and didn’t approach, only forming a red cloud about five meters away from the tree, buzzing. Finally, the two humans and the tiger could heave a sigh of relief and take a breather.</p>
<p>The Vermilion Bird stood in the tall tree, glancing down at them with a disdainful look and flapped its wings, as if it would fly away in the next moment.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu also realized that the Vermilion Bird was the nemesis of the Immortal Devouring Bugs.</p>
<p>He whispered, “Such a spiritual beast is not easy to tame. It might be better to twist its neck, smear Vermilion Bird’s blood on ourselves, and maybe we can force these damn insects to retreat!”</p>
<p>As he said this, Wei Jiu, with murderous intent, prepared to suddenly leap and capture the Vermilion Bird.</p>
<p>This scene was exactly like what Ranran had seen earlier when he killed the Black Flood Dragon.</p>
<p>At the same time Wei Jiu was preparing to strike, the Vermilion Bird seemed to expand as if inflated, doubling in size. When it opened its mouth to screech, it revealed sharp teeth, appearing terrifying.</p>
<p>Ranran grabbed Wei Jiu’s sleeve, “Don’t try to kill it. If it flies away, we’ll have to fight the insects again.”</p>
<p>Seeing Wei Jiu still eyeing the bird sideways, she knew his evil intentions hadn’t faded, so she quickly diverted his attention, “Don’t you think that bird looks familiar?”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu looked towards the Vermilion bird, suddenly noticed a crescent-shaped white fluff on the bird’s neck and recalled the cute little red bird that had cooed at the window in the illusion…</p>
<p>Except, back then, the fluffy chick was adorable, but now it had grown so large that he couldn’t connect the two immediately.</p>
<p>Just then, Ranran softly spoke to the Vermilion Bird, “Divine Lord, we’re in great trouble and need your help. Do you like listening to songs? I can sing for you, if you’d like?”</p>
<p>With that, Ranran closed her eyes, recalling the song she had heard in the illusion, and began to sing softly. Surprisingly, the melody was exactly the same as the one they had heard in the hidden cave underwater.</p>
<p>Her voice was melodious and her memory was good, so she sang the song remarkably well.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu watched speechlessly, as the girl sang with closed eyes. As the night wind blew, and the moonlight splashed upon her, he couldn’t help but feel that she was so exceptionally beautiful that he couldn’t tear his eyes away…</p>
<p>The bird, which had already taken to the air, circled once and slowly descended again, stretching its neck and looking at Ranran in surprise. In the melodious song, it seemed to recall its former master. It danced joyfully on the branch as she sang, appearing very happy.</p>
<p>In the midst of Ranran’s melodious singing, the bird suddenly flapped its wings and circled above the tree, flying faster and faster until, with a sharp cry, it soared into the sky.</p>
<p>This time, its body transformed from red to dazzling gold, like a sharp arrow shooting into the sky. As it struck the clouds, the night turned into day, and finally, the clouds transformed into a golden rain showering down towards the ground.</p>
<p>When the myriad red insects were hit by the golden rain, they burst one by one, turning into pools of bloody sludge falling to the ground.</p>
<p>When Ranran stopped singing, the golden rain also ceased. After a night of fierce battle, the faint light of dawn spread, and all the rampaging red insects turned into bloody mud, not a single one left.</p>
<p>As the red blood slowly seeped into the ground, the earth of Tianmai Mountain began to tremble slightly.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu exclaimed, “Not good, the blood of these insects has contaminated the spiritual veins of this sacred place. Tianmai Mountain is about to collapse!”</p>
<p>Ranran tried to climb onto the tiger’s back again, but at this moment, the Geng jin White Tiger, having expended too much energy defending Ranran against the Immortal Devouring Bugs, had depleted its spiritual power and once again transformed into a cat-sized creature.</p>
<p>As the ground shook, it lost its footing and fell into the nearby abyss.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu turned back to pull Ranran to leave with him, but she lunged to save the tiger, which was about to fall off the cliff.</p>
<p>Despite her agile skills, the ground shaking was too severe, and she also lost her balance and fell.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu instinctively reached out to grab her, but he was just a step too late and missed her.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu himself was momentarily stunned, baffled as to why he had reached out to save that annoying brat. But as he saw her falling, his heart skipped a beat, and without thinking, he acted.</p>
<p>The thought of that girl possibly dying like this… He couldn’t help feeling… a little reluctant?</p>
<p>But at that moment, countless rocks and debris fell, prompting Wei Jiu to quickly hide his uncharacteristic sentimentality, swiftly leaping downwards towards the mountain base…</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as Ranran fell, she managed to catch the White Tiger in time. However, as she tried to stabilize herself by thrusting her stick into the cliff, it was already too late.</p>
<p>Just as they were about to fall off the high cliff and turn into meat patties, with a sharp cry, the Vermilion Bird, now a golden color, appeared again. In a flash, it caught Ranran and the White Tiger, then swiftly dodged the flying rocks while descending towards the base of the mountain.</p>
<p>Since Dun Tian had passed and turned into this vast place, the Vermilion Bird had been trapped in the mountain. Now that the toxic insects had corroded the spiritual energy field of Tianmai Mountain, the Vermilion Bird could finally break free and experience the vast world.</p>
<p>Ranran sat on the bird’s back, tenderly holding the White Tiger in her arms, tears streaming down uncontrollably.</p>
<p>The White Tiger weakly raised its head, and licked the tears hanging on the girl’s tender cheek. It then tilted its neck, seeming to lose consciousness…</p>
<p>Ranran took off her outer garment, wrapped up the little tiger, and chewed a Qi-boosting pill to feed it: Shifu’s Beast Mastery Forbidden Technique was similar to the Water Demon being controlled in the Wangxiang River. However, his possession was more thorough, as he and the White Tiger were connected in life and death, meaning if the tiger’s body suffered, her master would also be affected. She hoped both Shifu and the tiger would hang on and not suffer any mishaps.</p>
<p>Just then, Ranran inadvertently glanced down and suddenly noticed something in the stream at the foot of the mountain…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Leaving aside the catastrophe of the insect disaster high up the mountain, at this moment, the people below had already formed ranks, preparing to resist the Immortal Devouring Bugs invading from above. Mu Ranwu stood at the forefront of the formation.</p>
<p>The Elders who had come with their disciples to participate in the Marrow-Cleansing Pool ceremony also rushed over.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu was waiting for this opportunity, the perfect chance to solidify her authority and clear her previous tainted reputation from her past life as a demonic lord.</p>
<p>When the righteous sects are defeated by the Immortal Devouring Bugs and in disarray, she would take action at the right moment, gaining fame and selling a favor to these righteous factions.</p>
<p>This plan was executing flawlessly!</p>
<p>Yesterday, when she flew down the mountain at lightning speed and intercepted Wei Fang and the Wen twins, she swiftly knocked them to the ground. She didn’t see that boy named Gao Cang, and she didn’t know if he clumsily fell into the cliff, but he definitely didn’t get off the mountain.</p>
<p>She didn’t kill Wei Fang and the others; she just knocked them unconscious. When the Immortal-Devouring Bugs come out later, these people will be the best nourishment for them.</p>
<p>As those insects suck enough spirit blood and grow to the size of a palm, they will start killing each other, leaving only the strongest one. As long as she, as the insect controller, control that insect king to enter her alchemy furnace and refine it bit by bit into elixirs, she can use this spiritual energies to suppress the grudge water poison in her body.</p>
<p>Thinking of this plan, which would eliminate both Wei Jiu and Xue Ranran, the two thorns in her side, and release her from the control of the Grudge water, Mu Ranwu felt extremely secure.</p>
<p>Even if Xue Ranran and Wei Jiu has won the chance to enter the marrow-cleansing pool, what use would it be? When they are being sucked dry and withered by the insects, they will probably regret coming to Tianmai Mountain…</p>
<p>Of course, she would still need to maintain appearances. When the Immortal-devouring Bugs swept through Tianmai Mountain, the people below the mountain also sensed it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it seemed that these Immortal-devouring Bugs, being not of this realm, had triggered the spiritual shield of Tianmai Mountain, which automatically trapped them inside the mountain. Otherwise, if these insects spread all over, the people below would suffer as well.</p>
<p>Tianmai Mountain is located in the middle of the convergence of three major sects, and people from various major sects have already issued warnings last night. In just one night, all the experts from the Top sects have gathered to prepare for the invasion from the mountain.</p>
<p>When Wen Hongshan looked at this spectacle, she actually felt a little fearful in her heart. However, when she glanced at Mu Ranwu, she found that she was surprisingly calm.</p>
<p>Why didn’t she notice that Mu Qingge’s sister was such a deep-thinking person in her past life ? No wonder Mu Qingge was no match for her and was defeated by her schemes…</p>
<p>After a whole night, everyone watched as the “red clouds” on the mountain grew thicker and thicker. They also witnessed the tragic scene of Wei Fang and the others being sucked dry by the red insects when they barely reached halfway down the mountain, but were helpless to do anything about it.</p>
<p>This insect disaster was completely unexpected. It seemed that everyone who went up the mountain would not come back alive.</p>
<p>Late that night, Mu Ranwu finally managed to set her heart at ease. When daylight came, the insects on the mountain would begin their battle for supremacy.</p>
<p>She could finally rest easy…</p>
<p>Just as Mu Ranwu was feeling triumphant, something golden shot up into the sky from Tianmai Mountain. Then, a golden rain fell, followed by earthquakes and shaking mountains.</p>
<p>These sudden changes were overwhelming.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier looked at the collapsed Tianmai Mountain and let out a sorrowful cry, “Ranran! Hurry down!”</p>
<p>And Second Uncle Master rushed up the mountain when the spiritual shield loosened, trying to see if she could assist Ranran.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when they rushed up, they encountered a black shadow speeding down the mountain.</p>
<p>That shadow was quick as lightning, heading straight for Mu Ranwu.</p>
<p>This black shadow was Wei Jiu. His face was full of murderous intent as he prepared to capture Mu Qingge and ask her why she had plotted against him so maliciously.</p>
<p>Since the key had been returned to Su Yishui, the soul oath had automatically dissolved. This damned woman had actually become so evil and vicious, so why should he even think about cherishing someone like her.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu couldn’t let herself be caught by him. She dodged and evaded, shouting at the same time, “These Immortal-devouring Bugs were released by this demon! In order to get a chance to enter the pool, he devised such a malicious plan! AH…”</p>
<p>Before she could dodge, Wei Jiu slapped her savagely.</p>
<p>This slap wasn’t at all gentle; Wei Jiu’s long black nails even left five bloody trails on Mu Qingge’s fair face!</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu was stunned by the slap, not so much by the pain but she was shocked by the wave after wave of humiliation that followed.</p>
<p>In her two lifetimes, she had never had to suffer the indignity of being slapped in the face. In her past life, although she was not powerful, she was good at maneuvering through social situations and had her sister to protect her, living a life of ease and privilege.</p>
<p>And now, Wei Jiu, who had always coveted *her, actually struck her so mercilessly, truly igniting her anger! *<em>Mu Qingge</em></p>
<p>On the sidelines, Wen Hongshan saw Wei Jiu descending the mountain and felt a surge of anxiety. When she conspired with Mu Ranwu, she was confident that Wei Jiu and all those who went up the mountain wouldn’t be able to come back down.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if someone managed to reveal that the junior Gui Baqian who entered the sect through her connection, was actually the Demonic cultivator Wei Jiu—that would mean her reputation would be completely ruined, and the position of Sect leader that was within her grasp would no longer be hers.</p>
<p>Wen Hongshan was no longer young, she had spent much of her early life mired in meaningless emotional entanglements.</p>
<p>Now, Wen Hongshan finally realized that she needed to make progress in her cultivation. Only by becoming the Sect leader could she fully enjoy the advantages of the Kongshan cave’s spiritual artifacts and become a great powerhouse of her generation.</p>
<p>But if Wei Jiu blabbed about the conspiracy between Mu Ranwu and her, and how she had deceived and murdered her mentor, schemed against her fellow cultivators, then in the entire cultivation world, there would no longer be a place for her!</p>
<p>So when Mu Ranwu made up the accusations against Wei Jiu and slandered him, Wen Hongshan was the first to respond, leading her disciples to confront Wei Jiu.</p>
<p>At this moment, the remaining Elders watched as the legacy of the marrow-cleansing pools, passed down generations, were about to be destroyed. They were aggrieved and frustrated. This demon should have been killed long ago. Now that he has entered the pool, he’s like a tiger with wings. He must not be allowed to leave alive!</p>
<p>With that in mind, everyone took turns to confront Wei Jiu.</p>
<p>Inside Wei Jiu’s heart, he was cursing up a storm.</p>
<p>The cultivation in his dantian was like a poor family’s rice jar, every time there was a little bit of surplus, it would still run out in an instant. He was a good demonic cultivator, but his life was really miserable.</p>
<p>Initially, Su Yishui robbed him of his cultivation, and when he finally recovered enough, he disguised himself and entered Tianmai Mountain. After overcoming all obstacles and entering the Black Pool, the spiritual energy he gained was then mostly sucked away by those insects.</p>
<p>Now that he had just escaped death and was ready to settle scores with that damned Mu Qingge, he had to face this continuous fighting with the righteous path. The Excellency Wei’s exasperation in his heart was about to burst out from the top of his head.</p>
<p>Right now he could only make a desperate attempt to break through…</p>
<p>Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Mu Qingge. She had incited everyone to fight against him and then hid aside, covering her injured face. It seemed she was about to scheme something else and claim credit with malicious intent…</p>
<p>Such a woman, a maverick in her past life, after being reborn turned out to be even more diabolical than him! It’s damn unbelievable!</p>
<p>Wen Hongshan also noticed that Wei Jiu was running out of spiritual energy. She was suddenly delighted and turned to Mu Ranwu with a fierce look, “Quick, go and kill him!”</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu never fought an uncertain battle. Seeing that Wei Jiu was indeed at his weakest, she finally relaxed, drew her sword for battle, ready to make a name for herself by slaughtering the demonic cultivator in one battle.</p>
<p>But just then, a loud bird cry came from the sky, piercing through the air and drawing everyone’s involuntary attention.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>They saw a golden Vermilion bird soaring toward them from the direction of the collapsed Tianmai Mountain, dragging its long tail feathers. Everyone exclaimed, “Vermilion Bird!”</p>
<p>When it flew closer, they saw that there was actually a person sitting on the large bird’s back.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier was the first to recognize the person on the bird’s back as her junior sister Xue Ranran. She exclaimed with joy, “Ranran!”</p>
<p>At that moment, everyone also realized that the girl holding a white cat, on the bird’s back was actually the female disciple of the Xi Shan Sect who had stumbled her way through the first trial before.</p>
<p>Wen Hongshan looked somewhat panicked as she glanced at Mu Ranwu.</p>
<p>If it had just been Wei Jiu who survived, it would have been easier to deal with; they could have simply framed him for everything. After all, he was a demonic cultivator, and even if he revealed the truth, they could just accuse him of framing them.</p>
<p>But now with Xue Ranran appearing, it wouldn’t be easy to fabricate lies. She could only look at Mu Ranwu, hoping she would quickly come up with a solution.</p>
<p>Just then, the vermilion bird descended, and Ranran jumped down from its back. The adventures on Tianmai Mountain had left her clothes somewhat tattered and covered in mud, with her hairband undone and her long black hair cascading down her waist like a waterfall.</p>
<p>But when she leaped down from the bird’s back holding the little white tiger, she exuded a wild and spirited aura, like a daughter of the mountain god.</p>
<p>As she landed on her toes, Uncle Master and Yutong hurriedly approached her, asking with concern, “Ranran, are you okay?”</p>
<p>Ranran shook her head and turned towards Mu Qingge, widening her eyes as she asked, “Elder Mu, why did you release the Immortal-devouring Bugs on Tianmai Mountain? Don’t you know there are still fellow practitioners up there? Your actions have placed them in mortal danger!”</p>
<p>This statement caused a commotion among the crowd, and they all looked at Mu Qingge in disbelief.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu hadn’t expected Xue Ranran to be so sharp and noticed her secretly releasing the mud-sealed balls. </p>
<p>However, she had already planned her response, trembling her lips in confusion, “Xue Ranran, I have no grievances with you, so why are you spouting such accusations? Everyone knows that nurturing those poisonous creatures takes at least fifteen years. But twenty years ago, your master nearly scattered my soul, and since then I’ve been living on the tree. How could I have nurtured such poisonous things?”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu let out a strange laughter when he heard this, “Mu Qingge, why don’t you have the same daring spirit as before? Since you dared to do it, why not admit it?”</p>
<p>Mu Qingge glanced at him, flicking her long hair and coldly said, “As you have said, I’ve always dared to admit to the things I have done. Although we’ve never gotten along, I truly did not release those Immortal-devouring Bugs. Are you also going to believe the slanderous words of this girl and insist on smearing my reputation?”</p>
<p>“Mu Qingge! Why don’t you admit it? Wasn’t it you who intercepted Wei Fang on the mountain, as well as us sisters, intentionally knocked us down, and then fed us to those insects?”</p>
<p>The golden light from the Vermilion bird was too dazzling, and it was only when a weak woman spoke up, that people realized the bird’s claws were holding onto two people.</p>
<p>One was Gao Cang, and the other was a withered-looking woman. People strained to recognize her and realized that this elderly-looking woman was likely one of the sisters of the Wen twins.</p>
<p>It turned out that when Ranran was descending the mountain, she suddenly discovered that there were two people lying in the river foam at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>She had the Vermilion bird fly lower, and then she discovered it was Senior brother Gao Cang and one of the twin sisters.</p>
<p>However, this sister Yujie already had most of her spiritual energy sucked away by the insects and looked spent.</p>
<p>It turned out that when Gao Cang had doubled back for Ranran, he couldn’t cross the bridge and so he went to the side, trying to see if he could walk back along the valley bottom to save his junior sister.</p>
<p>And so he fortuitously missed Mu Ranwu completely, and later, he found that he still couldn’t cross and had to dejectedly descend the mountain. He happened to see the three people who had been knocked down.</p>
<p>At that time, the red insects were swarming over. In the confusion and panic, Gao Cang only managed to carry the nearer sister Yu Jie and started running back towards the tree hollow.</p>
<p>Senior brother Gao Cang’s cultivation was very shallow, and ironically, that was a blessing in disguise. When he was bitten by the insects, he didn’t suffer too much loss of spiritual energy.</p>

<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p><br/>Gao Cang was a simple person, but also really blessed. When the two of them accidentally stumbled into a small water pit, the wine gourd around Gao Cang’s waist broke open.</p>
<p>Inside was the twenty-year-old fine wine “Detain Heaven’s Immortal” that his junior sister had given him. He had been reluctant to drink it, and now it was all spilled in the small pit, filling the air with a strong fragrance of wine.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, these insects seemed to dislike the smell of alcohol. Moreover, the unusual fragrance of the wine did not dissipate after being mixed in the water, masking the spiritual energy on both of them. So they stayed very still in the small water pit, miraculously surviving until Ranran arrived on her bird and finally escaped down the mountain safely.</p>
<p>Now that Yujie was still alive, although barely, she could reveal the truth and bitterly point out Elder Mu and Wen Hongshan’s malicious intentions.</p>
<p>Wen Hongshan really wanted to chop Mu Ranwu into pieces alive. She had boasted that there was no way the Immortal-devouring Bugs would fail, yet there came to be four survivors who made it!</p>
<p>If it had only been disciples from the XiShan Sect surviving, with Wei Jiu still alive, it would have been manageable. They could have accused Xishan Sect of being enemies with Mu Qingge from her past life, and claim that they have colluded together to slander them.</p>
<p>But Yujie’s testimony was the most damning!</p>
<p>Therefore, Wen Hongshan decided to cut her losses. She just had to insist that Wei Jiu had impersonated her distant relative’s junior and deceived her, pretending she knew nothing about the rest!</p>
<p>As for the Immortal-devouring Bugs, Xue Ranran had already said that Mu Qingge released them, which had nothing to do with her!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, she thought she had everything figured out, but forgot about Wei Jiu as a variable.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu himself didn’t understand why, looking at the Mu Qingge he had been thinking of for decades, he didn’t have the slightest romantic thoughts.</p>
<p>Looks like that saying about the Black pool breaking bonds was true. Looking at Mu Qingge, whose face was scratched and in a sorry state, he had absolutely no lingering feelings that he had harbored for twenty years.</p>
<p>He watched as Mu Qingge and Wen Hongshan trying so hard, feigning innocence, and found it somewhat laughable.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran might not understand why Mu Qingge did this, but he suddenly understood everything. Mu Qingge was indeed a clever schemer, hoping to hit three birds with one stone.</p>
<p>Her plan allowed her to first retrieve the Netherworld key from him and then lure him to Tianmai Mountain. Next, the spiritual energy of Tianmai Mountain would rapidly strengthen the Immortal-devouring bugs’ growth and spread by absorbing the spiritual energy of those outstanding disciples who have come here.</p>
<p>Controlling the Immortal-devouring Bugs meant that she could reclaim the spiritual energy from everyone once the insects returned to the cauldron. Even without entering the Marrow-cleansing pool, she could reap all the benefits.</p>
<p>Such a meticulous plot, he didn’t believe that the idiot Wen Hongshan, could have come up with it.</p>
<p>Since that was the case, they shouldn’t blame him for exposing everything. So when Wen Yujie weakly pointed out that Wei Jiu impersonated a disciple of Kongshan and entered Tianmai Mountain, he casually said, “Right, I haven’t thanked Mu Qingge and Wen Hongshan yet! If it weren’t for your efforts to arrange for me to enter Kongshan as a junior disciple of Senior Wen, how could I, an unorthodox demon, have blended in so smoothly?!”</p>
<p>This statement shocked everyone. Because Wei Jiu was indeed wearing the robes of a disciple of Kongshan, and at that moment, he even casually pulled out a face-changing mask and put on Gui Baqian’s face.</p>
<p>As the dark face appeared, everyone recognized him as the disciple of Kongshan who had passed through all the challenges from before!</p>
<p>Everyone remembered clearly that this junior had been recommended by Wen Hongshan and she claimed that he was her relative’s nephew.</p>
<p>Wen Hongshan forced herself to remain calm, her scar looking even more twisted. “Wei Jiu, you’re slandering me out of spite. It must be you who harmed my nephew and impersonated him to get in.”</p>
<p>At this moment, Ranran calmly said, “Whether it’s true or false can be easily verified. As long as someone is sent immediately to Senior Wen’s hometown to investigate, we can immediately find out if Senior Wen really has a relative cousin named Gui Baqian with a dark face. If there’s no such person, how would Senior Wen explain this?”</p>
<p>Wen Hongshan became speechless again.</p>
<p>Today’s unexpected events has been too many, some of them had been completely out of the blue. She was an orphan, adopted by Abbess Wen at an early age. Where would she have relatives? If investigated thoroughly, she would be exposed for certain.</p>
<p>Originally, her forceful inclusion of Gui Baqian to Tianmai Mountain had already attracted dissatisfaction from her sect. Now that Gui Baqian had revealed his true identity, she was utterly unable to defend herself.</p>
<p>At this moment, Wen Hongshan wanted to slap herself. Why had she been fooled by Mu Ranwu into agreeing to this risky move? Now, there were loopholes everywhere, each one leading her into an irredeemable situation.</p>
<p>Thinking of how Mu Ranwu had told her that Xue Ranran might be the reincarnation of the real Mu Qingge… Wen Hongshan gritted her teeth in anger. Now, she could only insist these two people slandered her and then silence them later…</p>
<p>“You’re spouting nonsense! It was clearly Mu Qingge who released the Immortal-devouring Bugs. You all don’t know, she’s not actually…”</p>
<p>Before she could finish, Wei Jiu, seemingly unfazed, casually dropped another bombshell. “Senior Wen, what’s there to hide? After all, you’re someone who dared to murder your own master. Poor Abbess Wen, who let the wolf into the house, raising such a ruthless person… Tsk tsk, you’re actually more suitable for practicing the demonic path than me!”</p>
<p>This statement shocked everyone into an uproar once again.</p>
<p>Wen Hongshan, in a panic, said, “It’s all nonsense! My Master clearly failed to withstand the heavenly calamity and passed away naturally. What does that have to do with me!”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, she didn’t understand Wei Jiu. When he helped others do bad things, although he didn’t leave his name, he always kept some evidence. So when he helped Wen Hongshan before, he naturally left evidence.</p>
<p>“On the day Abbess Wen faced the heavenly tribulations, she should have taken the Replenishing Spirit pill to restore her energy. That pill was refined by you, and you had added Grudge water that causes intense pain and prevents the gathering of spiritual energy. If anyone is interested, they can go see Abbess Wen’s body. The poison of the Grunge water would have penetrated her bones. I believe traces of it should be found on Abbess Wen’s charred corpse… Oh, and this Grudge water is so useful, she definitely wouldn’t use it all up. You can search her now, and there might be some unexpected discoveries!”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu could tell that Wen Hongshan presently had the Grudge water he gave her on her person, just by sniffing the air.</p>
<p>This woman was both foolish and venomous. She probably carried it with her to be ready to backstab someone, but she hadn’t expected Wei Jiu to survive and expose her.</p>
<p>Just as Wei Jiu finished speaking, several Elders from Kongshan quickly moved and snatched the bag from her waist, shaking it out to reveal a bottle. When it fell to the ground, the Grudge water immediately spilled out.</p>
<p>The disciples of Kongshan were all seething. They had been wondering why, with Abbess Wen’s cultivation, even if she couldn’t overcome the heavenly tribulation, she shouldn’t have lost her life this way!</p>
<p>Now, everything pointed to Wen Hongshan. The senior brothers who were already dissatisfied with Wen Hongshan crossing generational boundaries were immediately up in arms, surrounding and capturing Wen Hongshan.</p>
<p>In the chaos, Mu Ranwu silently adjusted her sleeve arrow and shot it at Wen Hongshan’s chest. With so many people around, as the arrow imbued with spiritual energy pierced Wen Hongshan’s chest, she widened her eyes, unable to speak, and fell to the ground dead.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu smirked inwardly. <em>Unreliable woman, still trying to expose her true identity?</em></p>
<p>Now that she had successfully escaped the control of the three major sects, she relied entirely on His Majesty Su Yu, who was her current pillar of support.</p>
<p>And to gain the support of the emperor of this generation, she needed the identity of Mu Qingge, who is protected by His Majesty. She couldn’t let Wen Hongshan, this foolish woman, ruin everything.</p>
<p>After doing all this, she quietly retreated into hiding. Although she didn’t manage to kill Wei Jiu and Xue Ranran, it was not bad to have killed Wen Hongshan, who knew her true identity.</p>
<p>The future is long, Sister… we’ll meet again.</p>
<p>With this in mind, taking advantage of the chaos of dogs fighting dogs, Mu Ranwu quietly escaped under the protection of her followers, covering her injured face.</p>

<p>The remaining people watched as the Kongshan Sect cleaned up its mess. But when they came back to their senses after watching the spectacle, they realized that not only did Mu Qingge, who was suspected of releasing the Immortal Devouring Bugs, had run away, but even Wei Jiu, who had incited the conflict, took the opportunity to escape without a trace.</p>
<p>But just then, someone exclaimed, “Look at her forehead, she entered the Marrow Cleansing Pool!”</p>
<p>At this moment, everyone took a closer look, and indeed, there was a “Mai” symbol on Ranran’s forehead, which was the mark of entering the Marrow Cleansing Pool. In fact, Wei Jiu originally had one too, but after being bitten by the insects several times, the lines on his forehead had become faint and almost disappeared.</p>
<p>When the people below the mountain learned that this seemingly ordinary little girl was actually the selected winner for this Marrow Cleansing Pool event, there was another uproar. After the Tianmai Mountain collapsed due to the pollution of the Immortal Devouring Bugs’ toxic blood, it was unlikely that there would be another Marrow Cleansing Pool event in the future.</p>
<p>And this disciple from the Western Mountain, who was seemingly inept, turned out to be the beneficiary of the last Marrow Cleansing Pool event, which made those younger generation disciples who had completely given up on their ambitions both envious and resentful.</p>
<p>But remembering that Wei Jiu had also entered the pool this time, so the presence of a righteous sect disciple was balanced against him, was also somewhat comforting.</p>
<p>According to the customary rules, everyone had to congratulate XiShan for producing outstanding disciples and send gifts as a token of encouragement.</p>
<p>In the past, the three major sects were generous in their exchanges, offering elixirs, magical weapons, all worthy gifts.</p>
<p>However, they had no previous relationship with Xishan, and now that their outstanding disciples had suffered losses, they had to send a gift to the Western Mountain, a rookie who had somehow taken the lead without cheating. This made them quite resentful.</p>
<p>So the gifts they sent were not heartfelt. Later, on the way back, Qiu Xier sorted out the gifts received by Ranran during a rest break on the journey. Besides the usual swords and blades, she unexpectedly found a box of Mind Clearing Pills, a rather humble gift.</p>
<p>“What junk! Ranran’s Mind Clearing Pills are a hundred times better than these. Giving such things to fool people, the three major sects must be struggling financially and on the verge of closing their doors?”</p>
<p>Ranran was applying medicine to the White Tiger. After giving it medicine, she gently moved the unconscious little tiger to the sunny spot outside the shade.</p>
<p>After hearing Qiu Xier’s words, she replied nonchalantly, “It’s already good to receive anything. After all, it’s just a courtesy exchange. Not only did the Kongshan Sect not give anything, we even gave a token of goodwill to them, which could be considered as paying the ‘white gold’ to Abbess Wen of the Kongshan Sect. You didn’t see the look of distress on Second Uncle Master’s face when she counted out the silver. Let’s just forget about losses and gains, we were all able to leave unharmed this time, that’s the best reward.”<br/>*<em>white gold is condolence money</em></p>
<p>Qiu Xier nodded happily and said, “Anyway, now all the major sects know that our XiShan’s younger generation is the most promising. Ranran, you are also considered famous now, and in the future, you will surely make XiShan surpass all the major sects!”</p>
<p>Later on, the incident with the Immortal Devouring Bugs seemed to be entirely attributed to Wen Hongshan. After all, such poisonous creatures needed years of cultivation, so how could Mu Qingge, who had just reincarnated, have such a thing?</p>
<p>And with the grudge between Wen Hongshan and Mu Qingge over ruining of appearances and men, even if she claimed before her death that Mu Qingge had orchestrated everything and she had only aligned herself with Mu, this alone was not enough to convince people.</p>
<p>The reputation of the Kongshan Sect was also completely ruined this time, with the loss of outstanding disciples and the destruction of Tianmai Mountain, exposing such shameful internal conflicts like murdering their Masters. It was rumored that the three major sects would have to undergo a revamping, and the rising XiShan Sect might replace the Kongshan Sect.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But as Qiu Xier was happily imagining all this, she saw Ranran kneeling in front of the little tiger, treating it with great respect while massaging its limbs as it basked in the sun. It looked like she was taking care of a bedridden elderly father.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier is a straightforward person so she asked what her junior sister was doing.</p>
<p>Since coming down from Tianmai Mountain, the little tiger had not opened its eyes. Ranran wasn’t sure if her Shifu was still merged with the tiger. But thinking of how Shifu had gone to such great lengths to watch over her, Ranran was moved beyond words.</p>
<p>She was afraid that if he remained motionless in tiger form, it would affect his blood circulation, so of course she had to massage Shifu three times a day while on the road.</p>
<p>But her Shifu turning into a tiger really affected his immortal demeanor, and the method he used seemed similar to the forbidden curse of the unorthodox sect that merged with beasts at the Wangxiang Pass.</p>
<p>Ranran felt that this matter couldn’t be disclosed, lest it tarnish Shifu’s reputation. She only informed Second Uncle Master secretly, so they traveled by day as well as night, in order to return home as soon as possible.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As for the Vermilion Bird, some people proposed dividing it when they were back at the foot of Tianmai Mountain. Ranran smiled and pulled out her mechanical stick, smashing the trial stone into pieces. She said plainly that whoever wanted to divide the bird has to win her first.</p>
<p>After all, everyone belonged to prestigious sects, and dignity was still important. After this demonstration of strength, no one brought up the matter again.</p>
<p>But such a golden bird, if it always followed them, even though it looked flashy and cool, would invite other trouble.</p>
<p>On the way back, Ranran would tease the Vermilion Bird now and then with food. After a few times, she found that it loved to eat her peanuts.</p>
<p>Every time it shrank in size a bit, Ranran would reward it with a few peanuts. Gradually, it actually shrank down to the size of a sparrow seen in the underwater illusion cave, its body turning into a pale red color. It hopped around on Ranran’s shoulder, occasionally diving into the snack bag to find food. At first glance, it looked like a domesticated small sparrow.</p>
<p>But Ranran didn’t make any soul contract with this Vermilion Bird. If it liked to stay by her side, she would take care of it, but if one day it wanted to leave, it was free to do so.</p>
<p>This way, was easier on everyone. Ranran now focused more on the little tiger. Besides, she urgently wanted to return to the Western Mountain to see if her master’s physical body was unharmed.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After three days, the “Mai” on Ranran’s forehead finally disappeared, indicating that she had completely integrated the spiritual power of the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.</p>
<p>When she returned to the Western Mountain, the first thing she did was to check the place where her master often went into seclusion at the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>The tightly closed stone door required spiritual power to open but neither of the Uncle Masters could open it. However, Ranran could easily do it now.</p>
<p>When she opened the stone door, she immediately saw Su Yishui lying on the ground, not knowing how long he had endured by himself in this place.</p>
<p>Ranran had always hoped that her worries were unnecessary, but she didn’t expect her Shifu’s condition to be worse than she imagined.</p>
<p>She rushed over quickly, with the help of the two flustered Uncle Masters, they got him out of the mountain cave. However, when she helped her master up, Ranran caught a glimpse of the bottle sealed with the Spirit Spring on his neck, which seemed to flicker with a faint red light, but it disappeared in an instant.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t have time to think about that. She recalled that Shifu had accompanied her to refine the pills for the tiger to eat, and he went into seclusion right after. It should have been around that time that he already merged with the tiger.</p>
<p>The battle on Tianmai Mountain and the Immortal Devouring Bugs had used up too much spiritual power. The little tiger had not awakened all this time, and it seemed that Shifu was also injured, not waking up no matter how she called.</p>
<p>At wits’ end, Ranran remembered the Ice Lotus Pool, which was an excellent place for healing. Shifu’s internal injuries were too severe, and someone needed to guide spiritual power into his body. Ranran was the only one who could accompany him into the pool.</p>
<p>So Ranran took off her master’s outer robe and entered the Ice Lotus Pool with him. The ice lotus in this pool seemed to have never waned since the last time they opened.</p>
<p>After entering the pool, the two Uncle Masters didn’t want to distract Ranran’s efforts to heal her master, so they retreated to the nearby house by the pool and waited.</p>
<p>Ranran held Su Yishui as they floated quietly in the water, feeling the abundant spiritual energy in the pool flowing back and forth. She guided it gradually into her Shifu’s body.</p>
<p>This kind of assisted healing of guiding spiritual energy was the most mentally exhausting. When she felt that the meridian blockages in her master’s body had been cleared, the fatigue from their desperate travel over the past several days, gradually dissipated in the extremely comfortable Ice Lotus Pool.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t know when she accidentally fell asleep. When she opened her eyes, she found that her Shifu was already awake. In a daze, she couldn’t help but smile happily at him.</p>
<p>But as she was smiling, Ranran realized something was wrong. Why was she being held in her Shifu’s arms like a baby?</p>
<p>At this moment, there was suddenly a sun shower, and the fragmented pearls entered the water, causing ripples on the water. The crystal-clear droplets slowly slid down his straight nose and fell onto his broad chest…</p>
<p>Even Ranran, who had not yet experienced love, after waking up suddenly to such a beautiful scene of a wet-faced handsome man, could only feel her mouth run dry and she suddenly wanted to drink a cup of ice-cold melon juice to quench her thirst.</p>
<p>Su Yishui stretched out his long fingers to touch the still unhealed wounds on her slender neck caused by the Immortal Devouring Bugs, then lowered his head and frowned, “Besides here, where else are you injured?”</p>
<p>Ranran somewhat understood why the little tiger didn’t move after being scratched on the chin. At this moment, being touched like this by her handsome Shifu, she also felt a tingling sensation that made her unable to move…</p>
<p>She stared blankly into his gaze and stuttered, “There are some injuries on my arms… Shifu… why are you holding me?”</p>
<p>“You were sleeping so soundly that if I didn’t hold you, water would have entered your mouth and nose.” Su Yishui’s eyes slightly drooped, explaining in his mild tone.</p>
<p>If he said that, didn’t it mean that while she was asleep, he had been holding her like this and watching her…</p>
<p>But now that Ranran was awake, his arm still did not loosen, still holding onto Ranran.</p>
<p>This situation of treating someone but being caught sleeping by them was really embarrassing.</p>
<p>However, being embraced like this by her Shifu reminded her of the time when she was surrounded by those red insects, and Shifu who had merged with the white tiger, had risked his life and wrapped her tightly with his body to keep her safe and warm.</p>
<p>After her parents, Shifu was the best person to her, so she didn’t feel that her master was being inappropriate. If she even thought about those impure ideas, she would feel like she was tarnishing such a good person like her Shifu!</p>
<p>Ranran whispered, “Shifu, I’m awake now. It’s still raining. Do you want to go to the pavilion on the shore to take shelter?”</p>
<p>Only then did Su Yishui let go of her hand that was around her, but still holding her wrist, he led her to the pavilion by the lotus pool. Su Yishui bent down to pick up his outer robe, but instead of putting it on himself, he turned around and draped it over Ranran.</p>
<p>By now, the drizzle had gradually turned into heavy rain. Senior Uncle Master Yu Chen, who was looking out the window, was about to happily go over when he saw the Master has awaken, but he was held back by his sister Yu Tong.</p>
<p>Yu Tong was more sensitive than her brother. She had long noticed that something was off with her Master’s attitude towards his little disciple Ranran.</p>
<p>Now looking through the window, with the Master’s tall figure protecting the girl in the pavilion, not letting the splashing raindrops fall on her.</p>
<p>A handsome man and beautiful woman looking like such a good match, amidst the sound of raindrops falling like pearls.</p>
<p>This wasn’t just a master’s attention for his disciple… Ever since Mu Qingge died, the originally cold Master had become even more withdrawn. But ever since Ranran came to Western Mountain, the Master, who had been like an exiled immortal before, seemed to become more……human.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Yu Tong didn’t want her thoughtless brother to disturb the ambiguous atmosphere in the pavilion, so she covered her brother’s mouth and pulled him away.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>In the pavilion, Su Yishui picked up the towel on the stone table to dry Ranran’s long hair.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t dare to trouble her Shifu, so she quickly took it over and stood up to dry Su Yishui’s long hair for him, “Shifu, why did you merge with the white tiger? This is really too dangerous!”</p>
<p>Ranran had read some books about practicing strange arts before. This kind of beast-controlling technique was slightly deviant; one could end up a beast for life if not careful. Her Shifu had taken such a huge risk, and just thinking about it made Ranran feel afraid.</p>
<p>Su Yishui mildly said, “You’ve been weak since childhood. Even though you drank the water I gave you, your dantian has been empty for too long, which can still damage your foundation. That’s why I needed to ensure that you would enter the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.”</p>
<p>His words implied not only protecting his disciple but also that if Ranran didn’t pass the test, he would personally be there to help her cheat.</p>
<p>Ranran widened her eyes, somewhat surprised at her master’s words, and asked in a small voice, “What if I didn’t pass, Shifu?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui smiled slightly at her question, his thin lips curling up to reveal his bright teeth, and he exuded a touch of wickedness.</p>
<p>Shifu did not answer, but Ranran felt that whatever he had planned must probably not be a good thing.</p>
<p>At this moment, she suddenly remembered the unfinished words of the Medicine Immortal, so she asked, “Shifu, when you participated in the Marrow-Cleansing Pool back then, which pool did you enter?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui’s smile faded slightly. He lowered his head, “What do you think?”</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t actually want to believe her vague guess. Could it be that her Shifu’s choice back then was the same as Wei Jiu’s? She couldn’t help but look up at her master, staring into his eyes and asking, “Did you… choose the Black Pool?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui didn’t speak, but his expression did not seem to deny it either.</p>
<p>Ranran couldn’t help but hold her breath, looking at him for a long time, she asked timidly, <br/>“Then… did you pay a price for it?”</p>

<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Su Yi Shui nodded slowly this time, but just as Ranran was about to ask him what was the price he had paid and how he had severed his emotions, he suddenly reached out and hugged her, his arms tightening around her until she found it a little difficult to breathe.</p>
<p>Through their damp clothes, she could even feel his heart beating violently. With his chin rested on her head, he spoke in a low voice, “Someone decided to compensate for my sins with her life without asking me……This kind of self-righteousness person, should I forgive her?”</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t have time to think about who that annoying person might be. She was struggling to breathe with her master hugging her so tightly. “Shifu… I can’t breathe… Are you feeling unwell?”</p>
<p>As she spoke, Ranran noticed that the talisman bottle on her master’s neck glowed with a red light again, but before she could exclaim her alarm, she was startled once again by Su Yishui’s actions.</p>
<p>Shifu was not only hugging her now, but he was rubbing his chin against her ear, exactly like… the playful little tiger.</p>
<p>Su Yishui seemed to also realize that his emotions were getting out of control. He struggled to suppress his strange actions, before reluctantly letting go and stepping back a bit, taking a deep breath before saying, “There are some side effects after using the Beast-Taming Art. The effects will pass in about a month….will be fine after time passes, just don’t come near me these few days.”</p>
<p>Ranran blinked, recalling the descriptions about Beast-Taming Art from the books. This kind of technique, which involves placing one’s soul in a spirit beast, would cause the practitioner to adopt the habits of the beast for a long time… So few people personally used such techniques.</p>
<p>The little Gengjin White Tiger liked to act spoiled and snuggle into her arms to be petted, scratching its chin and fur… Did Shifu just have the urge to act like a tiger and wanted her to scratch his chin and stroke his fur?</p>
<p>Seeing Shifu seemingly looking very upset, as if compelled by a strange force, Ranran reached out and stroked his long hair. Su Yi Shui seemed surprised by Ranran’s action, his eyes widened, but his body involuntarily leaned closer to her again.</p>
<p>The side effects of Beast-Taming Art were still evident, and its not easy to break the habits even after transforming back into a human form. The usually serious Shifu was now……adorable. Ranran couldn’t help but chuckle, but faced with such a handsome human-shaped big cat, she also found it rather difficult to take action.</p>
<p>Su Yishui stared at her playful and cute smile, his eyes suddenly turning slightly red, just like when he had been possessed by the Spirit Spring at the Military Platform before, exactly the same!</p>
<p>Oh no! Ranran exclaimed inwardly, but before she could check if the Spirit Spring on his neck had leaked out, he reached out and held her neck. In the moment Ranran looked up, her Shifu’s slightly moist lips stuck onto hers……</p>
<p>Of course, afterwards, Ranran expressed great understanding towards her master. It was just a side effect of possessing the white tiger. The little tiger often liked to be affectionate like this with her, sticking to her face…</p>
<p>For the sake of protecting her, Shifu transformed into the white tiger, and now he has these uncontrollable side effects!</p>
<p>She tried to calm herself down and rationalize the sudden situation, telling herself that she was just being kissed by the playful tiger.</p>
<p>But being kissed by a playful tiger wouldn’t give her this tingling sensation, being unable to move… This……was completely different!</p>
<p>After she dazedly let Shifu kiss her for quite a while, Ranran finally came to her senses. She pushed him away, and then tore down the mountain with long strides……She actually ran all the way to Uncle Master Zeng’s villa.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>It has been three days since her daughter had suddenly arrived. She showed no signs of wanting to go back.</p>
<p>It was great that Ranran could visit her parents, but seeing her daughter looking distracted every day… could it be that she had offended Master Su and had been expelled from the sect?</p>
<p>Qiao lian and Carpenter Xue were now working in Zeng Yi’s villa, had good income and lived as well as the rich masters in the town. They even had little maids and servants now.</p>
<p>And all of this was thanks to Master Su. So Qiao lian naturally wanted to find out what was wrong with her daughter. If her daughter didn’t want to go back, they wouldn’t want to take advantage of Master Su’s kindness. They would have to apologize to the Master. But if her daughter had suffered grievances on the mountain, they would have to back her up and then leave together.</p>
<p>“Mother… it’s nothing. I just missed you, so I came to see you.”</p>
<p>Qiao lian didn’t believe her and couldn’t help but point out to her daughter, “It’s a three to five day journey from Western Mountain to this place! How did you come here?”</p>
<p>After coming out of the Marrow-cleansing Pool, Ranran’s body was light and agile, so although it was a three to five day journey for ordinary people, she could reach it after half a day of running.</p>
<p>When Qiao lian heard that her daughter had run here, she was truly shocked and at the same time, deeply appreciative of Master Su’s truly miraculous abilities to have trained her weak daughter to possess such divine skills.</p>
<p>Seeing her daughter had become so healthy, Qiao lian naturally felt relieved. After confirming that her daughter was not injured or endured any grievances, she urged her daughter not to be lazy. Since she had rested here long enough, she should quickly go back to continue to work on her cultivation.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After perfunctorily agreeing, Ranran turned around and sat down limply on a lounge chair in the garden.</p>
<p>It was easy to run down the mountain, but how to  return naturally was another matter.</p>
<p>Ranran was now deeply regretting, why did she ran so far on impulse.</p>
<p><em>Wasn’t it just being kissed by Shifu? Its not like she had not been kissed by a tiger before, and in fact, there wasn’t much difference if one thought hard about it.</em></p>
<p><em>Shifu must also have been unwilling. He is usually so cold and aloof; if it weren’t for protecting her, why would he have found himself fallen to such a position?</em></p>
<p><em>Thinking about it this way, perhaps it wasn’t only embarrassing for her that day; Shifu must have felt many times more flustered as well. Especially after her running away in this way, he must have been even more mortified?</em></p>
<p><em>Moreover, Shifu’s eyes turned red. Could it be that his body is too weak, so he’s been affected by the Spirit Spring’s corrupting influence?</em></p>
<p>The more Ranran thought about it, the more worried she became. She got up with a grunt , not even caring to take the stir-fried pork and pickled vegetables that Qiao lian had prepared for her, and decided to return to Western Mountain right away.</p>
<p>But she did not expect that, as soon as she opened the door, she bumped into Second Uncle Master.</p>
<p>Seeing her, Yutong said crossly, “Ranran, why did you run off without a word? Do you know how worried we’ve been as we looked for you these past few days!”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>In truth, Yutong didn’t know why Ranran suddenly left the mountain that day.</p>
<p>Their Master had also chased after her that day. However, by night time, he had returned, looking like he was in an icehouse. The Master, who had regained some vitality, became frosty once more.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier and the others were worried about Ranran and had searched the town below but didn’t find her. Last night, when the Master instructed her to look for Ranran at the villa and bring the medicinal tree root water she had been drinking over as well.</p>
<p>When Ranran took the tree root water, she felt deeply ashamed again. Even at this point, Shifu was still worried about her old illness and sent someone to bring her medicine.</p>
<p>Yet she completely disregarded Shifu’s body which is still not fully recovered, and ran off on her own. Just think, how wrong was she?</p>
<p><em>Shifu! I’ve been unfilial, running away like this and not staying by your sickbed and serving you with all my heart!</em></p>
<p>With this in mind, Ranran drank the medicine water in one gulp, wiped her mouth and prepared to return to Western Mountain with Second Uncle Master. But Yutong stopped her, “Master said, you miss your parents, so you can stay here for a longer time. I’ve brought the tree roots for you to make the medicinal water, so you can stay as long as you want…”</p>
<p>Ranran listened to this with her mouth slightly gaping, feeling unsure if Shifu was going to expel her from the sect.</p>
<p>Actually Yutong was also very curious about what happened between the two of them that day after they had gone. She couldn’t understand why Ranran had fled all the way here and refused to see anyone.</p>
<p>When Second Uncle Master asked, Ranran, who was usually very frank and direct, started to speak hesitatingly. She didn’t want to tell others about Shifu’s condition.</p>
<p>If others misunderstood Shifu’s character and thought he was morally flawed, it would be her fault as a disciple. Besides, she had thought that Second Uncle Master, who had been by Shifu’s side for so many years, might have some kind of special relationship with him.</p>
<p>She didn’t want to say anything that might harm the relationship between Shifu and Second Uncle Master…</p>
<p>But if Shifu didn’t want her to return, that made her even more uneasy. She was worried that something else might have gone wrong with his health during this time.</p>
<p>Now in Western Mountain, her cultivation was second only to Shifu. If some mishap happened to Shifu, only she could help him redirect spiritual power and protect his body…</p>
<p>Thinking of this, she couldn’t stay any longer and was determined to go back with Second Uncle Master.</p>
<p>Second Uncle Master couldn’t understand what Ranran was thinking either. Seeing her insistence, she could only bring her back again.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When they returned, Ranran didn’t see Shifu. She heard that he had started seclusion again, and stopped his meals.</p>
<p>But he had just suffered a serious internal injury and needed recuperation, so fasting was obviously not ideal right now.</p>
<p>Ranran bought premium beef brisket in town. She also remembered that Shifu liked to eat sweets, so she also bought sweet chestnuts to cook with fatty duck. As for dessert, she added some almond pastries with sheep cheese, paired with a mellow Two Springs Yin Hao Green Tea.<br/>*银毫绿茶<em> 银毫</em> <em>yinhao is the fresh new green leaves from tea bush</em></p>
<p>She arranged a full tray and then carried it lightly, jumping all the way to the mountaintop.</p>
<p>The little tiger was lazily sunbathing at the entrance of the cave. When it saw Ranran, it immediately wagged its head and swished its tail.</p>
<p>Ranran placed the prepared meat bones and cut chicken pieces in front of it. The shrunken tiger didn’t eat much, but it was very particular and preferred the bones with some meat on and the crispy bone parts of the chicken was its favorite.</p>
<p>After feeding the little tiger, Ranran hesitated at the entrance of the cave for a while before entering with the tray.</p>
<p>But as soon as she entered, she did not see Su Yishui but smelled a strong scent of alcohol.</p>
<p>When she went in, Ranran saw small wine jars on the ground.</p>
<p>It seemed like Su Yishui was too drunk to be up, and sprawled on the stone platform.</p>
<p>A person who was usually so disciplined, with strong willpower, Ranran silently looked at the neatly arranged wine jars and the neatly folded semi-old clothes next to them. She really admired Shifu so much. Even when he got drunk, he didn’t allow his surroundings to be dirty and messy…</p>
<p>If it weren’t for the fact that he was lying there sprawled out, one would think he was just taking a nap, and not being drunk.</p>
<p><em>Shifu… could it be that he had been drinking to drown his sorrows because he thought I resented him?</em></p>
<p>Thinking of this, Ranran slowly crouched down, gently touching Su Yishui’s head. It was obvious that the aftereffects of the Beast-taming technique were still there. When her slender fingers touched his long hair, he couldn’t help but lean his head towards her hand like the little tiger.</p>
<p>Ranran found that she had no resistance to this cat-like attribute. Although Shifu was more haughty and aloof than the Gengjin White Tiger, but……stroking his hair, he was still very pleasant to touch.</p>
<p>At this moment, the drunk Su Yishui, seemed to sense someone beside him and suddenly opened his eyes.</p>
<p>When he and Ranran locked eyes, he suddenly sat up straight, staring at her big eyes.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t expect Shifu to wake up so soon, and she had not even withdrawn her hand that had been petting his head. She cleared her throat, pointing to the tray beside her and said, “Shifu, I’ve made food for you… eat some while it’s hot…”</p>
<p>Su Yishui looked at the steaming hot food and then at the run-away young girl who had returned. In the end, without saying anything, he quietly put on his outer robe, then picked up the bowl and chopsticks and ate heartily.</p>
<p>The master and disciple seemed have a great rapport and neither brought up the incident under the pavilion during the rain. After Ranran cleared away the small wine jars, she couldn’t help but ask, “Shifu… do you like Second Uncle Master?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui just finished his meal. After setting down his chopsticks, he took a sip of green tea to cleanse his palate, then looked up at her, silent for a moment before saying, “I thought, you were going to ask if I like you……”</p>
<p>Ranran smiled in embarrassment, “There is no need to ask. Shifu, you treat all of us disciples with great care.”</p>
<p><em>How many masters in this world would risk their lives to save their disciples?</em></p>
<p>Su Yishui’s eyes seemed to lose their light for a moment, and he asked coldly, “Didn’t you already leave? Why have you returned?”</p>
<p>Ranran bit her lip and said in a small voice, “I came back because I was worried about Shifu…”</p>
<p>Su Yishui glanced at her and this time answered her previous question, “Your Second Uncle Master has someone she loves and they even have a child, living in the town below Western Mountain. My liking for her is the same as liking Yuchen, Qiuxier and Gao Cang.”</p>
<p>Having been here at Western Mountain for so long, Ranran never expected that Second Uncle Master had a child. She couldn’t help but be very shocked, “What? How come I didn’t know?”</p>
<p>She was so astonished by this gossip, so much so that she did not realize that Shifu’s “liking” solely did not include Xue Ranran.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As it turned out, there were many things about Western Mountain that she, a small rookie, didn’t know! Second Uncle Master indeed had a six-year-old son.</p>
<p>Because Second Uncle Master was responsible for purchasing things from the town below, she could visit her family below the mountain from time to time, reuniting with her child and lover. No wonder she occasionally saw Second Uncle Master buying some wooden toys.</p>
<p>That lover was a schoolteacher in the town below, thirty-four years old this year.</p>
<p>It was said that Second Uncle Master met him when she was sixteen, and they developed feelings for each other. However, Second Uncle Master did not marry him but only had a child with him. After weaning, she let the scholar surnamed Chang take the child down the mountain.</p>
<p>Later, Ranran curiously asked Second Uncle Master why she didn’t marry, and Yutong sighed, “Since I’ve decided to follow Master in cultivation, I will have to abandon the secular world one day. I will follow my brother to serve Master, while he has his own worldly life to live. If I don’t marry him, he can marry the woman he likes in the future, without carrying the reputation of being unfaithful. Isn’t that the best of both worlds?”</p>
<p>Hearing Yutong’s words, Ranran couldn’t help but remember the two sealed memories she encountered on Tianmai Mountain. Cultivation was desirable for mortals, but if one had to give up all the beauty of the secular world, it wasn’t as desirable anymore.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>While applying medicine to the little tiger under the Pavilion by the pool, Ranran asked her Shifu who was drinking tea nearby, “What happened to Dun Tian’s wife and child later on?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui put down his teacup, looked at the distant mountain ridges, and said mildly, “Dun Tian had a life-and-death battle with the Earth Demon. His wife and child were taken by the Earth Demon as hostages. To defeat the Earth Demon, Dun Tian had to achieve enlightenment and reach a state of no desires. So he did not rescue his wife and child; after he subdued the Earth Demon, he ascended.”</p>
<p>Ranran drew in a cold gasp. Suddenly, she remembered that in Dun Tian’s memories, she never saw the faces of his wife and child. When Dun Tian ascended, did he feel guilty towards his wife and child, so much so that he didn’t dare to even think about how they looked like in his memories?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Ranran felt quite bad and asked her Shifu softly, “Shifu, if one day, you are also faced with such a choice, would you sacrifice your greatest love like Dun Tian did to achieve enlightenment?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui heard her question but did not answer. Instead, he asked her, “What about you? What would you do?”</p>
<p>Ranran thought seriously. In her life, apart from loving her parents and Shifu, she also loved her Uncle Masters and senior brothers and sisters. If she had to exchange them for some stupid eternal youth, she would rather become an old lady with wrinkles immediately!</p>
<p>But hearing her words, Shifu furrowed his brow, grabbed her by the neck, brought her close, and said, “Remember, you should never sacrifice yourself for anyone! I risked my life in exchange for yours. In this life, you live for yourself only!”</p>
<p>Ranran did not understand what he meant. She thought by ‘risking my life’ he was referring to the previous incident when he saved her when he merged with the White Tiger.</p>
<p>But Shifu was not wrong to say this either. Without him, she would have died from illness long ago!</p>
<p>Now that she knew that Shifu and Second Uncle Master were not immortal companions, Ranran felt relieved. But being pulled so close by Shifu, she couldn’t help but remember the last time Shifu had kissed her…</p>
<p>Could it be that Shifu is suffering from the aftereffects of possessing the tiger again, and he wants to be playful like the tiger with her?</p>
<p>Shifu could put his life on the line for her, how could she repay this kindness? Even if she gave her all, it wouldn’t be too much!</p>
<p>With that in mind, Ranran reached out with her hand and scratched Shifu’s chin a few times.</p>
<p>Su Yishui was stunned by the sudden action of her improper hand. While Ranran scratched his chin, she asked, “How does it feel? Do you feel comfortable?”</p>
<p>Whether words or actions, they all carry the same frivolous manner to harass decent people. Su Yishui had encountered this more than twenty years ago. However, back then, that striking and captivating woman had been full of carefree spontaneity, although teasing, he had never entered into her heart.</p>
<p>But the young girl before him now, although her actions are a little… impetuous, but her eyes are full of innocence and simplicity.</p>
<p>Whichever type, it would make a man feel like he’s drinking aged mellow wine, drowning in it and never wanting to wake up…</p>
<p>Just as Ranran was about to pull away, Su Yishui caught her by her slender waist, his thin lips, faintly scented with wine, met hers again. But this time, it wasn’t as gentle as before; Su Yishui let himself go completely, fiercely and passionately deepening this kiss.</p>
<p>Ranran was startled once again by her Shifu… This wasn’t a tiger being playful? This was clearly a predator who caught its prey, devouring it whole!</p>
<p>When Su Yishui finally lifted his head like he still didn’t get enough, his little disciple in his arms had melted into a puddle after the kiss.</p>
<p>Ranran instinctively wanted to run out of the cave, but Su Yishui, now experienced, held her slender waist tightly, “Where are you trying to run to? Didn’t you say you’ll take care of me until I have fully recovered?”</p>
<p>Even without looking in a mirror, Ranran could feel her cheeks slightly hot. Was this what they meant by heavenly tribulation, thunder and fire intertwining? Was it the feeling she just experienced?</p>
<p>This time, Ranran dashed away again. After forcefully pushing her Shifu aside, she ran back to her room, diving under the covers and refusing to come out…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Qiuxier noticed that her little junior sister, after returning from her visit to her parents, seemed to have lost her soul, always appearing preoccupied.</p>
<p>Even during her favorite pastry-making time, she could get distracted. Watching Ranran pour a bottle of dark soy sauce into the flour, Qiu Xier couldn’t stand it anymore, but lean in and ask loudly in her ear, “Junior sister! Are you making savory almond pastries?”</p>
<p>Ranran then came back to her senses, looking at the dark-colored dough in her hand and exclaimed, “Oh no!”</p>
<p>Qiu Xier, understanding the situation, took the dough from her hand and threw it into a bamboo basket used for composting, then said solemnly, “Luckily, Second Uncle Master isn’t here, or she would definitely feel sorry for the wasted flour… Ranran, you’ve been absent-minded these past few days, always skipping Shifu’s classes. Either you claim to have a stomachache or a headache… Could it be that you didn’t bathe in the Marrow-cleansing pool at Tianmai Mountain but in an infected pool?”</p>
<p>Qiu xier’s words were not an exaggeration at all. Since the incident with second senior brother last time, Su Yishui seemed to have opened his spiritual sense as a good mentor, paying close attention to their studies, completely changing his previous lax and uncaring attitude.</p>
<p>But the usually diligent junior sister now seemed possessed by second senior brother, playing truant and feigning illness.</p>
<p>Yet, when it came to the junior sister, their now strict Shifu went back to being lax. If Junior sister said she was sick, Shifu believed her without question and never urged her to attend class.</p>
<p>Because Qiu xier couldn’t cross the Snake Bridge at Tianmai Mountain, she was punished by Shifu to practice Light Body Skill. Everyday she had to walk back and forth on a hemp rope tied between two trees. If she fell, she had to skip dinner.</p>
<p>In just a few days, Qiuxier had lost alot of weight, her small pointed chin becoming prominent. So this morning, she tried to imitate junior sister and told Shifu her heels hurt, so she couldn’t stand for long.</p>
<p>But unlike junior sister’s situation, Shifu’s kindness was nowhere to be found. After hearing her complaints expressionlessly, Su Yishui instructed her to fetch spring water up and down the mountain until her heels stopped hurting.</p>
<p>After Qiu xier’s heels miraculously stopped hurting without any medication, she was particularly curious about junior sister’s secret to faking illness.</p>
<p>Ranran let out a long sigh but then asked third senior sister out of the blue, “Senior sister, has Shifu ever been particularly close to you?”</p>
<p>Qiu xier thought for a moment and said, “The closest proximity was when I made a mistake in writing the Wind Control Technique, and Shifu punished me by hitting a ruler on my hands. Now whenever Shifu looks at me, I will break out in a cold sweat… Why, did Shifu punish you too?”</p>
<p>Ranran thought of the heated kiss she shared with Su Yishui in his arms, and her ears started burning.</p>
<p>Qiu xier didn’t understand and, seeing junior sister blush, thought she might really have a fever, reaching out to feel her temperature in concern.</p>
<p>Just then, Gao Cang ran up from below the mountain, shouting loudly, “Junior sister, there’s a package with your name on it at the Guest-Declining Stone down the mountain!”</p>
<p>Ranran peeked out from the kitchen window and indeed saw a delicate package in Senior brother’s hands.</p>
<p>Seeing senior brother eager to open the package, Ranran hurriedly shouted, “Wait!”</p>
<p>Then she quickly jumped out from the window and said, “We don’t know who sent this package; we can’t open it recklessly. What if it contains Immortal Devouring Bugs? That would be disastrous!”</p>
<p>Upon hearing Ranran’s reminder, Gao Cang got frightened and threw the package far away on the ground.</p>
<p>Having personally experienced the scene of Immortal Devouring Insects covering Tianmai Mountain, he still can’t help but shudder at the sight of a red-headed fly now.</p>

<p>Ranran cautiously walked over and carefully examined the package, only to find a line of words on top of it – “For Xue Ranran.”</p>
<p>She didn’t recognize the handwriting, and since she had just left her parents, it was unlikely that they would ask someone to deliver something so soon.</p>
<p>So the three of them gathered around the paper package for a long while, finally deciding to take it down the mountain and open it there.</p>
<p>But just as Ranran was about to take the package and head down the mountain, she happened to run into Su Yi Shui coming towards her.</p>
<p>When Ranran unexpectedly looked up and saw her Shifu in white wide-sleeved robes with half-tied hair, she suddenly felt at a loss like a mouse meeting a cat.</p>
<p>Her lips even began to tingle slightly, as if spontaneously recalling the agitated feeling of being swept away by fierce winds and waves.</p>
<p>However, Su Yi Shui seemed to have completely forgotten what had happened a few days ago. Without even looking at Ranran, he simply took the package from her hands.</p>
<p>Su Yishui recognized the handwriting on the package.</p>
<p>He looked up coldly at Ranran and said, “This is Wei Jiu’s handwriting.”</p>
<p>Ranran was somewhat bewildered, wondering why Wei Jiu would suddenly send her a package.</p>
<p>After Su Yishui shook the package to make sure there was nothing harmful inside, he opened the oiled paper wrapping.</p>
<p>Inside was a jade medicine box wrapped in fine velvet. Such exquisite items were very extravagent. Made from top-quality jade, hollowed out, and meticulously carved. When the small ring was pulled open, apart from fragrant medicinal pills and ointments for external use, there was also a handwritten letter from Wei Jiu.</p>
<p>As Su Yishui read the letter, Ranran couldn’t contain her curiosity and couldn’t help but lean over to read.</p>
<p>Without getting into Wei Jiu’s questionable character and morals, his literary flair was actually pretty good.</p>
<p>The letter described Wei Jiu’s thoughts after parting ways with Ranran, how he would reminiscing about their experiences of life and death together on Tianmai Mountain at nights. He even mentioned the sweet potato slices that Ranran had personally given him, which he cherished. Worried about any scars the insect bites might leave on Ranran’s delicate skin, he specially sent miraculous medicines to help her heal…</p>
<p>The following paragraphs were filled with flowery language of love and nature, moonlit nights, typical of when a man tries to flaunt his literary prowess, with thoughts meandering endlessly, as tedious and smelly as foot-binding cloth.</p>
<p>Before Ranran could finish reading, Su Yishui had already crushed several sheets of paper into ashes with his large palm.</p>
<p>Ranran said in a small voice, “I haven’t finished reading yet…”</p>
<p>Su Yishui tilted his head slightly, even his sharp nose emitting a cold aura. “Do you want to write him a reply so that Excellency Wei can write another one for you to enjoy?”</p>
<p>Ranran pursed her lips, unable to speak further. She watched as her Shifu raised his hand and threw the valuable jade medicine box down the mountain, crashing loudly and shattering into pieces.</p>
<p>After throwing away the box, Su Yishui left without looking back.</p>
<p>Ranran was very disapproving of her master’s crudeness. Although their XiShan sect and Crimson Gate sect were irreconcilable, there was no enmity with money. Such a valuable item should be returned or pawning it for money would have been better than just throwing it down the mountain.</p>
<p>However, Wei Jiu’s act of sending medicine to Ranran sparked Qiu Xier’s endless curiosity once again. How could her junior sister have such great charm, making even someone like Wei Jiu personally send gifts to express gratitude? Could it be that Wei Jiu had developed feelings for her junior sister and intended to lure Xishan disciples away?</p>
<p>In the cultivation world, such things occasionally happened, like when Mu Qingge enticed Su Yishui away in the past.</p>
<p>If Wei Jiu valued Ranran’s potential and wanted to lure away outstanding disciples from Xishan using his allure, it was entirely possible.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier thought Wei Jiu actually looked quite good, but alas, his tendency to open up people’s stomachs after disagreement, made him an unsuitable match for a celestial couple. Qiu Xier couldn’t help but shake her head and feel sorry for her junior sister.</p>
<p>However, from this perspective, her junior sister was still highly regarded by these powerful cultivators.</p>
<p>Learning from the lesson of their second uncle Master, who is bound to separate from her mortal partner after decades on the cultivation path, finding a fellow cultivator to ascend together was the true path of cultivation.</p>
<p>Hence, the partners of cultivators were mostly unrelated to romantic love; they simply supported and elevated each other over the long time it takes in their path of cultivation. Her junior sister’s recent rise in status at such a young age indicated that she might not have to wait until her face was full of wrinkles to achieve something significant. It seemed finding a cultivation partner would also be just around the corner!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran had no time to dwell on these thoughts. She had indeed been deliberately avoiding Su Yishui recently, especially after the kiss in the cave, which was too ambiguous for her to rationalize. Of course, this was also related to the aftermath of Shifu using the Beast-Taming Technique.</p>
<p>Ranran was very self-conscious, and she dared not assume that her Shifu had any unusual feelings towards her. So she tried to avoid Shifu as much as possible these days. Once Shifu’s side effects subsided after a few days, their relationship of a kind master and filial disciple could naturally return to its harmonious state.</p>
<p>But Wei Jiu’s untimely solicitous letter had to arrive at this time, and untimely seen by her Shifu.</p>
<p>If Shifu misunderstood her resolve, thinking she was being tempted by a demonic cultivator and intentionally avoiding him to prepare to defect from the sect, wouldn’t that… be a huge misunderstanding?</p>
<p>So after avoiding her master for several days, Ranran finally took the initiative to bring freshly baked almond pastries to her master today.</p>
<p>Su Yishui was meditating by the poolside. He is tall and slender, with long limbs. Even though he is just sitting casually cross-legged in simple white robes, with his broad shoulders and his narrow waist, he was still very pleasing to the eye.</p>
<p>This must be what people mean when they think of majestic and elegance . From a distance, against the backdrop of the ice lotus pool, the man with thick brows and long hair actually surpassed the flowers in exuding divine refinement.<br/>*龙章凤姿<em> literally majestic demeanor of a dragon and the graceful elegance of a phoenix</em></p>
<p>Ranran walked slowly over in small steps, but she didn’t get too close. Instead, she asked through the pavilion railing, “Shifu, would you like some almond pastries?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui didn’t look at her but said mildly, “Your body is so healthy today that you can leave the bed to make pastries?”</p>
<p>Ranran knew her recent attempts to feign illness were crude, and her weak lies wouldn’t hold up. But Shifu clearly knew the reason and had no right to reproach her.</p>
<p>She remembered that her purpose today was to express her true intentions, so she said very softly, “Shifu, please rest assured, no matter how demons tempt me, I will not defect from the sect…”</p>
<p>Su Yishui looked up at her this time, still speaking mildly, “*Don’t say something you cannot be certain of. Perhaps one day, you will find that I am not worthy of being your teacher, and you will voluntarily leave the sect.”<br/>*话不要说满，事不必做绝 </p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Ranran felt her Shifu was being too childish. Did he think she avoided him these days because she was repulsed by him?</p>
<p>So she hurriedly knelt beside him with the pastries in hand and said, “Shifu, what are you saying? How could your disciple abandon her Shifu? These days, I was just afraid that Shifu would always be like the tiger…… and when you recall it later on, you will feel uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>Su Yishui didn’t look at her, just closed his eyes again and said coldly, “Rest assured, I was just affected by the Spirit Spring leaking and lost control for a moment. It won’t happen again……”</p>
<p>Ranran understood his meaning; Shifu was saying that his side effects had dissipated, so he wouldn’t be as affectionate towards her like the little tiger as before, always hugging and kissing.</p>
<p>With her Shifu’s assurance, Ranran should have felt relieved. However, seeing him colder than before, she inexplicably felt a little sad. She couldn’t help but feel like their relationship… couldn’t go back to how it used to be.</p>
<p>But she didn’t have much time to dwell on this sadness because the jade bottle on Su Yishui’s neck, containing the Netherworld spiritual spring, was turning redder.</p>
<p>Su Yishui had once said that the spiritual spring should not linger too long in the secular world, or it would become increasingly sinister.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Mu Qingge was killed shortly after she had obtained the Spirit spring, so the spring had remained in the mortal realm for about twenty years. </p>
<p>Although Elder Jiu provided a jade talisman bottle to contain it, it was not a long-term solution.</p>
<p>Before the Marrow-Cleansing Pool assembly, the Spring was stable because Su Yishui’s spiritual power could suppress it. But due to Su Yishui merging with the white tiger to protect Ranran and suffering heavy internal injuries, the Spiritual Spring seemed to sense his weakened state and became restless again, attempting to break free from its confinement and escape.</p>
<p>Later, when Ranran and the others returned in time, Su Yishui woke up in time. However, the flawless jade bottle now had two fine cracks.</p>
<p>This was not a good sign. Since Wei Jiu had returned the key, it was a matter of urgency to return the spiritual spring to the Netherworld.</p>
<p>However, opening the Netherworld had its timing and location requirements.</p>
<p>The timing had to be during the peak of Yin in the mortal realm, in a place where the Yin energies was at its strongest.</p>
<p>But the flow of Yin energy was constantly changing, affected by the seasons and temperatures. The timing and location of opening the Netherworld realm were unpredictable, so the pattern on the key would change every five years after each use.</p>
<p>The most recent best opportunity had already been used by Wei Jiu. Unfortunately, Wei Jiu’s went for nothing and he only found an empty and dried-up spring. The next opening would require another round of effort.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Recently, there has been a flurry of activity in front of Xishan’s Guest Declining Stone. After Wei Jiu sent medicine for the first time, perhaps seeing that the girl didn’t return anything on the Stone, he thought she was easily swayed by his literary talent and gifts, so he continued to send a few more times.</p>
<p>Noticing her Shifu’s increasingly tense expression, Ranran can’t avoid writing a stern letter to clarify her stance.</p>
<p>After finishing the letter, Ranran even specially showed it to her Shifu, asking if her response was appropriate. </p>
<p>Her Shifu glanced at the few lines of elegant handwriting and disdainfully threw it aside. He then wrote a big *”Get lost” on a piece of paper and handed it to Ranran, saying, “Copy it and send it out.”<br/>*滚 <em>go away, get lost</em></p>
<p>Ranran is a very teachable child, she immediately understood that her master found her writing too much for the devil and didn’t express a strong enough intention of breaking ties.</p>
<p>And Shifu’s one-word reply was ingenious, as it carried a strong sense of righteousness. So she respectfully copied a “Get lost” with explosive font, placed it on the Guest-Declining Stone along with all the gifts sent by Wei Jiu.</p>
<p>This one word was definitely effective, and since then, the stone finally resumed its peaceful days.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>However, things with Wei Jiu has quieten down, but General Qin Xuanjiu, who guarded the Wangxiang Pass, came again.</p>
<p>Since the water demon incident, the court had sent people several times to search for new water demons. However, nothing sinister happened at the Wangxiang Pass again, and Qin Xuanjiu’s compass remained silent like a piece of scrap iron.</p>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu had never encountered such a situation before. When he went to the Capital to report to the Emperor’s inquiries, he also asked his mentor, Mu Qingge, how to deal with this situation.</p>
<p>But Mu Qingge coldly said she didn’t know and told him to go ask Su Yishui.</p>
<p>Later, it seemed like his master had completely forgotten about her closed-door disciple. He sent letters to the Capital several times, but never received a reply from Mu Qingge. He found out after that his master had left the capital to attend the Bone Marrow Pool Meeting.</p>
<p>This time, the situation has escalated too much at Tianmai Mountain. Even Qin Xuanjiu in the northwest heard the news, which said that Mu Qingge had not changed her evil ways and had caused a huge disaster by releasing something called the Immortal Devouring Bug, destroying the spiritual veins of the Bone Marrow Pool, and so on.</p>
<p>His revered mentor had just experienced a hard-won rebirth, yet in the short time when she had barely accomplished anything, criticisms from the righteous faction poured forth like a torrential flood.</p>
<p>Although Qin Xuanjiu was not present, he was sure his Master was good and someone was framing her.</p>
<p>Back then, if it wasn’t for his Mentor sealing the spiritual spring, wouldn’t the world have been in chaos? But people were blind and always blamed his Mentor!</p>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu believed it was the three major sects fabricating stories to smear his Master’s reputation, so he came to Xishan to find Su Yishui for an explanation. He also wanted to see if Su Yishui could help clear his Master’s name and remove the injustice.</p>
<p>Su Yishui didn’t get along with him and didn’t bother to meet him.</p>
<p>So Ranran went down the mountain to receive this Uncle Master Qin on behalf of her Shifu.</p>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu, seeing that Su Yishui didn’t even show his face, was very angry: “If my Master had kept rats and cockroaches back then, they would be better than Su Yishui! Now people from the major sects are cursing my Master, but he just remained indifferent and refuses to speak out about the good things my Master did for the world. He’s truly heartless!”</p>
<p>If General Qin said something else, it would be fine, but he insulted Su Yishui like this in front of Ranran, which made her very unhappy!</p>
<p><em>Her Shifu was the best in the world, who was this despicable Elder Mu to compare?</em></p>
<p>So Ranran was not very polite and told him about the situation at Tianmai Mountain back then: “If it weren’t for my lucky escape, I would have been killed by your Master on the mountain. Even if she was a great person in the past, since her rebirth, I haven’t seen her do anything good! My Master said that your Master also left you instructions in the past life. If the compass remained silent, it would mean that the situation at the Wangxiang Pass is over, and you can leave freely without being burdened by her orders. Since the present Mu Qingge has forgotten what she told you, just remember your Master’s instructions!”</p>
<p>It was true that Mu Qingge did leave Qin Xuanjiu with these instructions.</p>
<p>But at this moment, Qin Xuanjiu was shocked by Ranran’s words and stared at her with wide eyes.</p>
<p>“How… how is that possible? My Master is not like that… you, you little brat, you’re talking nonsense! I’ll tear your mouth apart!”</p>
<p>He actually lunged at her, ready to teach Ranran a lesson.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Ranran was not the same as before. Qin Xuanjiu, with teeth bared and claws out, came at her, but Ranran easily knocked him down.</p>
<p>The tall man lay on the ground motionless, crying loudly, snot and tears streaming down, saying, “Even if the world curses my Master, I will never betray my Mentor! My Master is the best!”</p>
<p>Ranran felt like she was facing a three-year-old with a full beard, completely unable to reason with him.</p>
<p>But at that moment, Qin Xuanjiu choked up and stopped her from leaving, stuttering, “You once said that the ointment your Master prepared can heal flesh wounds… Can you get me a box? Otherwise, I’ll cry under Xishan every day, causing chaos in the Fengshui of Xishan, and no one will be able to cultivate peacefully!”</p>
<p>Ranran wasn’t afraid of his threats, but she found his shameless behavior both annoying and amusing. She asked who he needed the medicine for.</p>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu straightened up and said he heard that his Mentor’s face was scratched by Wei Jiu and had been festering, so he came to scold Su Yishui until he felt remorseful and ask for a divine medicine to heal his Mentor’s face!”</p>
<p>Ranran looked at the troublesome General Qin and felt a headache. She felt that Mu Qingge probably entrusted the Spiritual spring to Qin Xuanjiu not because she thought he was very lucky but because she saw that his stubborn streak made him unlikely to break his vows.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t want to help heal Mu Qingge’s injuries, but keeping such a big man crying at the foot of the mountain was not a solution either. Finally, Ranran went to her Shifu’s pharmacy, rummaged through bottles and jars, and managed to find a bottle of ointment her master had prepared before. She gave it to Qin Xuanjiu and persuaded him to leave.</p>
<p>The only thing Qin Xuanjiu was right about, was that Mu Qingge’s facial injuries were indeed getting worse.</p>
<p>Although she had shifted the blame regarding the Immortal Devouring Bug incident onto Wen Hongshan, her reputation was still tarnished.</p>
<p>After all, intercepting Wei Fang and the two Wen sisters, was an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>As a result, the Elder Kaiyuan of the Jiuhua Sect completely turned against her, publicly stating that if he ever saw this ungrateful person again, he would surely kill her and scatter her soul again.</p>
<p>However, Mu Ranwu did not take the threats from the three major sects to heart.</p>
<p>At present, she didn’t rely on those so-called prestigious and righteous sects. Even if she incurred infamy, so what? People in this world respect strength; she was no longer an ordinary woman. Sooner or later, those righteous sects would have to look up to her…</p>
<p>However, at the moment, looking at the woman in the bronze mirror whose face was ruined, Mu Ranwu found it difficult to face herself!</p>
<p>She had spent the effort of two lifetimes to achieve her stunning appearance, yet Wei Jiu had destroyed much of it with a single scratch.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, she was filled with resentment!</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu viciously struck the mirror with the comb in her hand, creating a uneven large dent, causing the reflected image to become even more distorted and ugly.</p>
<p>Just then, a eunuch came to the palace gate to deliver medicine. One was the medicine personally prepared by the current emperor’s imperial physician. The other was sent by General Qin of the Wangxiang Pass, supposedly a spiritual medicine obtained from Su Yishui.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu instructed the palace maid to keep the ointment sent by the emperor. As for the gift sent by that foolish Qin Xuanjiu, Mu Ranwu didn’t even bother to look at it; she just ordered the palace maid to throw it far away.</p>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu was indeed useless. She wondered why her sister had taken him in as a disciple in her previous life. Instead of seeking medicine from anyone else, he had to gone to Xishan.</p>
<p>Did Su Yishui and Xue Ranran have any good intentions towards her? How could they possibly send genuine medicine for her injuries? In her opinion, it might as well disfigure her further!</p>
<p>With that in mind, she instructed someone to bring the bottle of medication sent by Su Yu. Upon opening the pearl-encrusted jade medicine box, a faint medicinal fragrance wafted out.</p>
<p>After the palace maid tested the medicine, Mu Ranwu felt assured enough to apply it on herself.</p>
<p>Over the years, Su Yu, due to his poor health, had sought many experts, and so they collected quite a few remedies for flesh wounds.</p>
<p>After applying the medicine, Mu Ranwu felt that her previously burning wounds were soothed and felt much better.</p>
<p>Just then, the eunuch said softly, “His Majesty shows compassion for the War Goddess’s health, so he specifically obtained this Heart-Eroding Grass that can temporarily restrain the Grudge Water for you. However, this type of divine grass only temporarily alleviates pain… The specific solution still requires your careful consideration… The Grudge Water is also a demonic entity from the Nether realm, perhaps the Spiritual Spring is the solution to dispel it…”</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu thanked the eunuch with a smile and instructed to have him escorted out of the West Palace.</p>
<p>This Heart-Eroding Grass ingridient had been discerned by Su Yu’s alchemy master, from the pills Su Yishui had given her before.</p>
<p>With this spiritual grass which grows once every twenty years, she was not afraid even if Su Yishui falls out with her and refused to give her the antidote.</p>
<p>After taking the Heart-Eroding Grass, her body indeed felt much lighter. She dismissed the attendants and palace maids, then sat cross-legged on a fragrant mat, focusing on meditation and restoring her vitality. Cultivators must not slack off; she had inherited great energy from her sister, but it had been greatly reduced by the Grudge Water’s constraints. </p>
<p>If she didn’t strengthen her cultivation now, her strength might fall behind Xue Ranran who had just emerged from the marrow-cleansing pool.</p>
<p>In her previous life, she had secretly compared herself to her sister, falling behind for a lifetime, leaving an unresolved knot in her heart.</p>
<p>This lifetime, she clearly had a better start than her sister by several times. How could she passively watch that mediocre person surpass her again?</p>
<p>She absolutely couldn’t afford to lose inexplicably again!</p>
<p>Although the plan with the Immortal Devouring Bug at Tianmai Mountain had failed, she still had a way.</p>
<p>Because she knew that the Spiritual Spring of the Nether Realm was in Su Yishui’s hands. Previously, Su Yishui had used the antidote for the Grudge Water to threaten her, so she naturally dared not speak out.</p>
<p>But now that she had completely fallen out with the people of Xishan, she didn’t have to worry about these things anymore. Once news about the Spiritual Spring was in Su Yishui’s hands spread… The days in Xishan would be even more lively than Tianmai Mountain in the past… She hoped that her reincarnated sister would be able to find some peace and focus on cultivation…</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Mu Ranwu smiled delightedly while meditating. On her still unhealed face, the crimson scar appeared even more ferocious…</p>
<p>The aftermath of the Tianmai Mountain incident lasted a long time. Outstanding disciples from the three major sects were all injured, especially the Jiuhua and Kongshan sects suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>The winner for the marrow-cleansing pool unexpectedly did not come from the three major sects, landing on Xishan, which had been relatively unknown for years! This served as an inspiration to new cultivators who had not yet joined a sect.</p>
<p>So after the morose Qin Xuanjiu had been sent away after much effort, there came a group of young people eager to join the sect.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier took Ranran to look down the mountain. This time, those who came to join were not ordinary disciples; they all had a refined aura and were likely not ordinary people. Some even came with an existing cultivation.</p>
<p>If they took in a group of outstanding disciples, it would mean that the Lingxi Palace of Xishan had seized this opportunity, with a chance to surpass the three major sects at one go and become the leader of the righteous path.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even though Su Yishui had become more diligent about teaching his disciples now, he had no interest in having disciples all over the world.<br/>*桃李满天下</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>
<p>I LOVE this following chapter after their kiss! I get a feeling things have slowly changed between Ranran and Su Yishui. </p>
<p>Su Yishui under the influence of the Spirit Spring, is now acting more like himself. Which is a good thing! This way, Ranran does not love the ‘wrong’ stoic Shifu and could see all his petty shortcomings for herself <em>hahaha</em> Jealous Su Yishui is such a hoot.</p>
<p>This is the first time Ranran had anything negative to say about her Shifu, and its because he did not decide to sell off that jade medicine box for money!<br/>Little disciple only has money on her mind in this life, in contrast to how she lived lavishly in her past life.</p>
<p>But its obvious she was also in denial right?<br/>She may not have the confidence to think that Shifu likes her but she definitely drawn to him like a moth to a flame. Who is the one waxing poetic like Wei jiu whenever she sets eyes on her Shifu? <br/>Filial piety?? SURE.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">初次入京 FIRST TIME IN THE CAPITAL</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Even though talented youths continued to come calling, the gates of Xishan remained tightly closed.</p>
<p>Second senior brother, who came to deliver items, greatly appreciated the master’s principle of preferring to have quality over quantity.</p>
<p>Bai Baishan now had no cultivation, equivalent to being a useless person. It was already a challenge for him to skillfully use his feet to eat; he was far from the realm of crafting intricate items with his feet.</p>
<p>If Shifu were to find new disciples with excellent aptitude at this time, wouldn’t it be a case of favoring the new and abandoning the old, leaving all his old disciples in the cold?</p>
<p>However, regarding the matter of accepting new disciples, Su Yishui had actually asked the opinion of his little disciple.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran was administering medicine to the little tiger and was somewhat surprised by her Shifu’s words. “Shifu, regarding the recruitment of disciples, it is naturally up to you to decide. However, if we are to bring in new people, I’m afraid we will need to renovate some of the houses on the mountain again, which could be a bit troublesome. I wonder if Second Uncle Master is willing to spend money on repairs.”</p>
<p>After hearing her reply, Su Yishui nodded and instructed Yu Chen to go down the mountain and get them to leave.</p>
<p>Ranran felt that her Shifu was not someone indecisive and needed to listen to others’ opinions.</p>
<p>However, when it came to matters like the houses on the mountain or the goods and books stored in the warehouse, Shifu always bypassed the two Uncle Masters and specifically asked for her opinion, as if she were the old owner of Lingxi Palace, and he needed her approval for everything.</p>
<p>But Shifu had too many quirks, and Ranran had already gotten used to them.</p>
<p>Since the last quasi-cold war, she and Shifu had finally managed to resume a peaceful relationship between master and disciple.</p>
<p>They both tacitly avoided mentioning the two times they had embraced and kissed.</p>
<p>After all, there was still the danger of the spiritual spring leaking, and solving this matter was urgent.</p>
<p>Apart from the time spent practicing and meditating, Su Yishui always took Ranran to the study, where they buried themselves looking through the pile of ancient books.</p>
<p>The entrance to the Netherworld Realm was elusive, originally found on the patterns of the key.</p>
<p>However, Wei Jiu had already used it, so those patterned maps were now outdated. If they waited for new patterns to emerge, it would take several years at least.</p>
<p>But Su Yishui’s rune bottle around his neck might not last that long, so they had to find another way. They couldn’t just wait for the key to reveal a new map. The master and disciple duo tried to find some clues in the ancient books.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge was probably someone who loved reading in her past life and had collected many ancient books from all over. Ranran was now proficient in light-body technique, so she didn’t need a ladder to climb up and down for books, which was convenient.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But while she was busy dusting and flipping through the books, her Shifu was casually half-lying on the mat, supporting his head with one hand, reading the book “Playing Classic” compiled by Mu Qingge with great relish.</p>
<p>As a disciple, Ranran couldn’t reprimand her Shifu for being lazy and slacking off, so she worked even harder to read through everything, afraid of missing any hints or clues.</p>
<p>But after reading for a long time, she got dizzy and tired. Even though she was very energetic now and not as sickly as before, she still needed to catch her breath.</p>
<p>As she raised her head to refresh her mind, she happened to see the afternoon sun shining in on Su Yishui’s face. At this moment, the flowers outside the window were blooming brightly. She looked at her Shifu’s handsome face and couldn’t help but start to daydream: After the incident at Tianmai Mountain, Ranran thought that even if her Shifu had some affectionate feelings for Mu Qingge before, he should have been disillusioned by now.</p>
<p>Who knew Su Yishui could still casually read Mu Qingge’s old works without any aversion.</p>
<p>Was this considered lingering affections, intertwining of love and hate?</p>
<p>If her Shifu couldn’t let go of Elder Mu in his heart, how could he….. kiss her without any burden? Even if it was as her Shifu said, that his actions couldn’t be controlled due to the leak of the spiritual spring, but he had kissed her twice in a row!</p>
<p>Could it be, as Second Uncle Master said, that a man’s emotions would eventually succumb to the test of time? Once passionate vows, reluctance to give up, eventually became clouds in the sky and foggy moons, fading into an indiscernible memory…</p>
<p>When Su Yishui slowly lifted his head and looked at his little disciple, Ranran’s big eyes gazed at him gently, but it was as if she was looking beyond him, towards the distant mountains, rivers, and seas…</p>
<p>The little vermilion bird was pecking at peanuts by the window of the study. After eating a few, it mischievously threw the peanut shells at Ranran’s face.</p>
<p>Ranran suddenly snapped back to reality, but found that she had been carelessly staring into her Shifu’s eyes for quite a while. Her face blushed instantly, and she hurriedly explained, “Shifu, I didn’t mean to stare at you…”</p>
<p>Su Yishui slowly raised the book in front of him, blocking the view of his little disciple. He did not seem to want to hear her feeble explanation at all.</p>
<p>However, his leisurely words came from behind the book, “This book records the deliciousness of the pan-fried buns from ShengJi in the Capital. Do you want to taste the flavor of these pan-fried buns?”</p>
<p>When food is mentioned, Ranran’s Ren,Du vessels immediately opened up. She looked at her Shifu with delight and said, “Shifu, are you going to the Capital? Then take a look at page seventy-two of ‘Playing Classics’ The duck fat pastry cakes from the hundred-year-old Duck Fat Biscuit Shop in the west of the city are also worth trying. Just don’t know if the taste of these delicacies has changed since they were recorded twenty years ago…”</p>
<p>Su Yishui stood up and knocked on her head with the book. “Didn’t you also correct some errors in this ‘Playing Classics’ book? I can take you to taste them all. If there are any mistakes, you can make revisions.”</p>
<p>Ah! Hearing Su Yishui’s say this, Ranran’s face flushed and paled. She remembered her mischief, adding corrections to the “Fierce Beasts” section in “Playing Classics.”</p>
<p>She had thought her Shifu would never read such nonsense, but today he actually read it all through!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>However, the reason Su Yishui suggested going to Capital was not because of a greedy appetite but because all the ancient books in the study were complete sets, except for a set of “Records of the Fantian Sect,” which was divided into two volumes. Volume One was still here, but Volume Two was missing.</p>
<p>This Fantian Sect was what Elder Jiu had mentioned, a demonic sect formed by those bewitched by the spiritual spring. There would definitely be records about the Netherworld Realm in their accounts, but unfortunately, the crucial second volume was missing.</p>
<p>But Mu Qingge was also afraid of forgetting, so she had written a line on the first page of the first volume: “Lent to Xiao Yu, with a pot of peach blossom jade bone wine, to be returned next month.”</p>
<p>When Ranran looked at her master pointing her to read this line, she was momentarily confused about who “Xiao Yu” referred to.</p>
<p>At this moment, Su Yishui said expressionlessly, “She should have lent the book to Su Yu, so we have to go to Capital to collect the book.”</p>
<p>Ranran blinked and tentatively asked, “Shifu? Are you planning to sneak into the palace to ask the emperor for something?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui stood up, patiently correcting her, “It’s us. Don’t forget, I told you, you are not to leave me by even half a step.”</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Cultivation and the mundane world were originally two distinct realms that did not interfere with each other. However, after borrowing something from someone, even if it’s the Emperor himself, it should still be returned.</p>
<p>Ranran felt that her Shifu’s words made sense, and going to the Capital, such a bustling place, was quite tempting for someone like her, still young and with a wavering will in cultivation.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier and Gao Cang were also very excited. They had followed their master to remote places to vanquish demons and monsters, and now they could experience the hustle and bustle of the most prosperous place in the world, to feel the atmosphere of ten miles of colorful and bustling night markets.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>However, when they finally arrived outside the Capital and were forced to camp in a small forest outside the city, the beautiful dreams of the three disciples were slightly shattered.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier persistently asked, “Shifu, are we staying here tonight? We could just walk a bit further and enter the city gates. There should be cheap inns in the city that won’t cost very much…”</p>
<p>Their Second Uncle Master laid grass mats on the ground under a tree, where Su Yishui sat cross-legged, instructing, “You lot, look for some soft branches to sleep on. If you fall off the tree, you’ll have to write the Lightness Mantra a hundred times.”</p>
<p>In these days, Gao Cang and Qiu Xier had made rapid progress in their lightness skills. However, spending the night on soft branches was still quite challenging.</p>
<p>But since it was Shifu’s orders, they didn’t dare to argue. Ranran took the lead and jumped onto a pine tree. Although the branches were dense, they were all sharp needles. Sleeping on them was like sleeping on a bed of needles, even more difficult than the master’s request.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier and Gao Cang saw Ranran taking extra effort and refrained from bargaining with Shifu.</p>
<p>So they each chose a sturdy poplar tree, but since Shifu had instructed them to sleep on the thin branches at the treetop, they had to go to the top of the tree.</p>
<p>However, during the night, they realized their strategy was flawed. While the Poplar tree’s branches were indeed strong, the tree was tall. When they accidentally fell, it was truly miserable.</p>
<p>Amid yet another of Qiu Xier’s cry from falling off, Ranran suddenly opened her eyes and looked towards the Capital. Dark clouds covered the city, with lightning and thunder, indicating an impending storm.</p>
<p>Turning to look under the tree, Ranran found Shifu also awake, staring fixedly at her. She couldn’t tell how long he had been looking at her…</p>
<p>When he saw Ranran look at him, he shifted his gaze towards the Capital. </p>
<p>Wondering about how long Shifu had been staring at her, Ranran’s ears started to burn. To ease the awkward atmosphere, she cleared her throat and asked softly, “Shifu, why is the rain so strange, only in the city, while outside it’s a clear moonlit night?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui did not answer, just gazed deeply towards the Capital before saying to Ranran, “You were not focused on sleeping so you need to be punished as well; you’ll have to write the Lightness Mantra two hundred times tomorrow!”</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>So Ranran had to close her eyes and try to sleep. However, after a while, the mischievous girl opened her eyes again and looked straight at her Shifu.</p>
<p>Shifu was indeed still watching her!</p>
<p>This time, caught red-handed, it was too late for Su Yishui to avert his gaze!</p>
<p>The two stared at each other in the moonlit pine forest, one on the tree and the other below, without saying anything for a while.</p>
<p>In the end, it was actually Ranran who dodged first, turning quickly on the tree to avoid Shifu’s somewhat intense gaze.</p>
<p>But she made a thud and Ranran also fell from the tree with an exclamation…</p>
<p>The next day, as they washed by the river, Qiu Xier was quite pleased. She had fallen three times last night, Senior brother four times, and even Ranran, who was so outstanding, had fallen once.</p>
<p>Her cultivation was not great enough when compared to Ranran, but she was not the worst.</p>
<p>At that moment, Shifu took out the six small compasses that the second senior brother had sent last time, clearly crafted by Uncle Master Zeng. Everyone had one, hanging from a necklace like a large pendant.</p>
<p>Ranran noticed it resembled the one Qin Xuanjiu held at Wangxiang Pass. It was just smaller and more exquisite.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui told them it could predict good or bad luck. If the compasses were in disarray, it meant demonic forces were approaching, and they would need to be extra cautious.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier was puzzled, “We’re not going to remote mountains and waters but to the bustling city of Capital. Do we really need this?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui didn’t answer, just walked towards Capital. The disciples hurriedly followed, but Ranran, looking at the compass hanging around her neck, felt a faint unease…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Su Yishui still retained some humanity as their master. After entering the city in the morning, he invited three disciples who had not slept well for a night to have Shengji’s pan-fried buns.</p>
<p>Ranran discovered that Elder Mu was still quite reliable when it came to eating and drinking. Shengji’s pan-fried buns, which had been around for thirty years, were so delicious that they made one’s mouth water.</p>
<p>However, she noticed that Shifu didn’t eat them himself, just quietly served her the buns and even prepared dipping sauce for her.</p>
<p>Su Yishui had just bought the aged vinegar from the Baiwei Ji next door. The dip was only half a spoon of vinegar added with three drops of chili oil. The mix was precise, following the guidelines of “Playing Classics” comparable to the art of mixing poison.</p>
<p>The owner of the stall was nearing fifty and gave a few more glances to customers who brought their own vinegar to dip the buns.</p>
<p>When they finished eating and it was time to settle the bill, the owner cheerfully said, “There have been customers before who brought Bai wei’s vinegar to eat buns with. Let me think… it seems like more than twenty years ago, a beautiful young lady who looked like a painting came by. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Not only was she beautiful, but she was also generous. During meals, she would give golden leaves as tips! Real gold! Should I say this or not, young lady, you are also beautiful and eat so well, just like that lady, both of you are extraordinary beings like immortals!”</p>
<p>After saying this, the owner eagerly looked at Xue Ranran who was paying, hoping she would also give some tips.</p>
<p>After all, Baiwei Ji’s sealed vinegar was not cheap, specifically made for the nobles in the capital, and one jar costs five taels of silver.</p>
<p>For someone who is so particular to food and drink, she might be a young lady from a noble family come out to play. Surely, they would give a tip.</p>
<p>However, Ranran stretched out her empty hand and apologetically said, “Eight plates of buns, six bowls of fresh duck blood soup. I gave you half a tael of silver earlier, and you still owe me five wen.”</p>
<p>The owner’s face fell slightly, smiled awkwardly, and found some change.</p>
<p>Its not that Ranran didn’t want to be generous, but the rules of the Xishan Lingxi Palace was to live frugally. Behavior like what the owner described, giving a golden leaf as a tip for a meal, was extravagant and probably could get one expelled from the sect on the spot.</p>
<p>Ranran knew who the owner was talking about, probably Mu Qingge herself.</p>
<p>Thinking about how sinister and scheming Mu Qingge is now, Ranran sometimes felt that the Mu Qingge from her past life and the current Elder Mu were completely different people.</p>
<p>How did such a divine and extraordinary woman, turn into someone so intolerable now?</p>
<p>But thinking about how Mu Qingge used to be very close with the current Emperor Su Yu, with a backer like the young Prince Su back then, naturally, she had plenty of money to squander.</p>
<p>The expenses of XiShan now are all from hard-earned money from Shifu’s consultations. Naturally, they have to be as frugal as Second Uncle Master and meticulously account for every penny!</p>
<p>Just out of the bun shop, Qiu Xier dragged senior brother off to buy sugar figurines, while their Uncle Masters were instructed by Shifu to go to some alley to handle their accommodations in the Capital.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran followed behind Su Yi Shui, preparing to shop around, when the sky was covered with dark clouds once more, and the master and disciple were stuck under the long eaves of the street market’s alley.</p>
<p>Watching raindrops splatter on the ground and pedestrians hurrying to seek shelter, Ranran curiously looked up at the sky, “The Capital is really a dragon’s ground, why is there so much rain?”</p>
<p>After saying that, she turned to look at her master beside her, who was staring at her intently, just like last night…</p>
<p>Perhaps fearing raindrops would fall on his disciple, Su Yishui slightly shifted himself to stand beside her, half embracing Ranran in front of him, shielding her from the rain. However, his clothes got wet, clinging to his shoulders, outlining the attractive and sturdy curves of his back.</p>
<p>Ranran could almost touch her Shifu’s chin if she raised her head a bit.</p>
<p>She carefully glanced at her Shifu’s neck, where the talisman bottle was tucked into his collar. There was no change in color, but the Yin energy from the spiritual spring occasionally leaked out, affecting Shifu’s mood.</p>
<p>If Shifu couldn’t control it, he might end up kissing her again…</p>
<p>Thinking about the passionate kiss with this tall man, Ranran’s earlobes blushed slightly.</p>
<p>But when she looked up again, she realized Su Yi Shui wasn’t looking at her; instead, he turned his head to watch raindrops fall under the eaves, deliberately avoiding her gaze as if he was also afraid of being misunderstood…</p>
<p>Just then, more people ran under the eaves to avoid the rain, diluting the ambiguous atmosphere between the two who were alone just now.</p>
<p>However, because of the crowd, Ranran was squeezed into her Shifu’s embrace. Su Yishui held her with one arm, preventing her from being jostled by others.</p>
<p>During this boring time waiting for the rain to stop, people sheltering from the rain naturally complained to each other, “What’s up with this weather lately? It rains almost every day. I didn’t even have a pair of dry socks when I came out in the morning!”</p>
<p>“Yeah! I really want to go to the Dragon King Temple and ask if they can move the rain somewhere else. Within a hundred miles, it’s only raining continuously only in the Capital! This is too unnatural!”</p>
<p>Talking about this sudden heavy rain, the people who were avoiding it were all too ready to complain endlessly about it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the rain came quickly and left quickly. After *an incense stick of time, the rain finally stopped.<br/><em>*30min to an hour</em></p>
<p>However, the sky after the rain was still gloomy, as if it hadn’t quite cleared.</p>
<p>When the rain stopped, Su Yishui walked to the river inside the Capital. The river was already full, reportedly due to this once-in-a-century continuous heavy rain. The Waterworks Department had started digging canals to divert the overflowing river water.</p>
<p>However, it was said that a few days ago, there was a murder case at the construction site, with three people dead, so the work was only halfway done and temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Ranran saw Shifu staring intently at the river surface. She walked over, wanting to see what had caught his attention.</p>
<p>But as she approached the water, she suddenly felt a flash in front of her eyes. It seemed like fish scales from a passing fish under the water had been shining brightly.</p>
<p>When she took another closer look again, the river water was dark and obscure, and she couldn’t see anything clearly. At that moment, Ranran looked down at the compass hanging around her neck and noticed the gears on it were spinning frantically.</p>
<p>Startled, Ranran instinctively grabbed her master’s hand, quickly pulling him away from the inner river.</p>
<p>Her experience at Wangxiang Pass told her that there might be something strange in the river. It was better to stay away until she understood what was happening.</p>
<p>“Shifu, the compass on my neck was moving vigorously just now.”</p>
<p>Su Yishui nodded and said to her, “Go back and tell Gao Cang and Xier not to approach the city river casually.” After saying that, he added, “Let’s go, see if Yutong and the others have settled our accommodation.”</p>
<p>With that, Su Yishui did not seem like he intended to investigate further into the bottom of the river, and he walked away from the inner river.</p>
<p>Ranran glanced back at the calm river surface and quickly walked to catch up to him.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When Ranran reunited with Qiu Xier and the others and they all followed Shifu to a secluded mansion in the western alley of the Capital, they opened the seemingly ordinary main door. Inside the spacious courtyard, there were actually elegantly carved buildings and corridors, exuding a luxurious atmosphere.</p>
<p>This place did not seem like a house their stingy second uncle master would rent.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Su Yishui mildly mention that this was his property in the secular world, not a rented one, the three disciples who had not seen much of the world were shocked once again.</p>
<p>Besides the large size of the mansion on the limited and precious land of Capital, the furnishings in the hall, the hung famous paintings, and the antique items placed around, all seemed very valuable.</p>
<p>It was hard to imagine that their master, who usually wore semi-old long robes, was actually such a hidden wealthy person.</p>
<p>But upon careful thought, Su Yishui was once the son of a Prince, so it made sense that he had plenty of money.</p>
<p>However, the Prince had failed in his rebellion and was stripped of his title and properties. How could Su Yishui still retain this property in the Capital?</p>
<p>When Ranran cautiously asked Su Yishui about this, he simply said, “I’m not listed in the clan records of the ancestral house, and this isn’t the property of the royal family. It’s my private property, always under Zengyi’s name.”</p>
<p>Before he practiced cultivation, he was a child kept outside the main family, and although he later took the Su surname, he was still not listed in the Su family’s lineage records. When he said this wasn’t the royal family’s property, he was clearly saying this place was not gifted by Prince Ping xi.</p>
<p>Could it be that while he was cultivating, he was also earning a significant fortune away from the Sect, so he could retain this private property even after Prince Ping xi’s defeat?</p>
<p>Ranran suddenly remembered that when Uncle Master Zeng had fallen on hard times, Shifu had supported him in reopening a hot spring inn. That inn was exclusively for high-ranking officials and nobles, lavishly decorated. Just relying on Shifu’s income from treating a few patients a year would not be enough. It seems Shifu’s wealth is truly substantial; even if he doesn’t become an immortal and his father had been killed, he is still a wealthy man.</p>
<p>However, only three old servants have been maintaining this place for twenty years, so there are inevitably some shortcomings in the buildings. That’s why Su Yishui had Yutong and the others come earlier to tidy up the place for accommodation.</p>
<p>Because the mansion is spacious, each disciple got their own room. Ranran noticed that her room, like over at the Western Mountain, was located near water.</p>
<p>Shifu explained that her elemental affinity is wood, and being close to water is beneficial for her health. Actually Shifu was worrying too much, because she can’t go thirsty even if she is not beside water. That night, as if to confirm this, there was thunder and lightning, and torrential rain poured down from the sky.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">伤感离愁 SADNESS AND SEPARATION</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Ranran wrapped herself tightly in the quilt, preparing to sleep quickly. However, she couldn’t help but peek outside at the sky, which was an indescribable pitch black.</p>
<p>So she got up again to close the window. Through the window, she saw Shifu holding an umbrella, standing on the eaves, looking up at the direction where lightning streaked across the sky in the pouring rain…</p>
<p>Because he had merged with the White Tiger and the residual effects hadn’t completely healed yet, so standing in the rain like this was not ideal. However, Ranran was tactful and didn’t go disturb him.</p>
<p>She could feel that there was a deep pool in Shifu’s heart, untouched by any kind of external storms. But what kind of melancholic past or sorrow lay hidden in that pool, it seemed it wasn’t something she, as his disciple, could inquire into.</p>
<p>The next day, after breakfast, Ranran brewed the medicine to heal internal injuries for Shifu and brought it to the corridor, to watch him drink it.</p>
<p>Since the incident at Tianmai Mountain, Ranran had been studying medical books, specially concocting this tonic to calm the mind and nourish vitality and body for Shifu.</p>
<p>Pills and elixirs, they nourish spiritual energy. For nourishing the physical body, these medicinal soups are needed for greater effectiveness.</p>
<p>But Su Yishui disliked the bitter taste of these medicines. Despite being usually calm and composed, he could hold the bowl and stare at the medicinal broth for a long time without drinking it.</p>
<p>Ranran had no choice but to watch Su Yishui without blinking, afraid he might pour the medicine into the nearby pool when she wasn’t looking.</p>
<p>To distract Shifu, Ranran took over the bowl for him, urging him to drink quickly while talking to divert his attention.</p>
<p>“Shifu, shouldn’t cultivators abandon worldly pleasures? Why do you have so many properties?”</p>
<p>This method seemed to work. Following Ranran’s wrist motion, Su Yi Shui finally drank the bowl of medicinal broth quickly, although his thick eyebrows were knitted into a frown.</p>
<p>Ranran quickly took out a preserved plum soaked in honey that she had prepared and stuffed the plum into Shifu’s mouth.</p>
<p>However, in her haste, her slender fingertips accidentally entered his mouth along with the plum and were gently sucked by his thin lips.</p>
<p>Ranran was startled, quickly retracting her hand. Before she could feel embarrassed, she heard Su Yishui slowly say, “Because there was someone who liked spending money, always indulging in pleasures and accepting money from unrelated people. At that time, I thought if I had these things, she wouldn’t have to spend money from other people and be criticized by everyone… “</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t expect Shifu’s answer to be like this. But at that time, the person who spent the most money around him… was Elder Mu Qingge, right?</p>
<p>Ranran’s expression was somewhat complex for a moment, hesitating, “Shifu, don’t you hate lavishness and wastefulness the most? Why did you encourage extravagance like this?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui bit hard on the plum pit in his mouth, his eyes fixed on her, as if he could see through her and saw another, murmuring softly, “She had been a rich young lady from a young age, but due to family changes, she brought her only sister to cultivate in Western Mountain. A genius among demonic cultivators, whoever became her master considered her a treasure and was particularly strict in disciplining her. Perhaps because of the strictness, she had none of the carefree childhood other children had and might have felt regretful. When she finally reached maturity, she loved to indulge in eating, drinking, and having fun, living like a reckless child… Growing up in wealth from childhood and then enduring years of arduous cultivation on the mountain, can you expect her to have any concept of money and wealth when she entered the secular world?”</p>
<p>If the “‘she” he was referring to was Mu Qingge, then everything made sense. This explained Mu Qingge’s extravagant and indulgent behavior and her love for food and drink.</p>
<p>Listening to Su Yishui’s tone, there was no blame, but rather a tone full of indulgence…</p>
<p><em>So all his desperate efforts to earn money was for his Master to spend it… no matter how you looked at it, it didn’t seem like being respectful and filial to an Elder; it looked more like a poor guy desperately trying to earn money to support his wife…</em></p>
<p>Thinking about the various entanglements behind Su Yishui’s actions, he had actually liked Elder Mu to this extent, Ranran suddenly felt a little bitterness in her heart.</p>
<p>It wasn’t really jealousy, just a profound sadness, and it was also more of worry. If Elder Mu was a good person, then it wouldn’t be a problem no matter how much Shifu longed for her.</p>
<p>An immortal partner like this, they also seemed very well-matched!</p>
<p>But Mu Qingge’s character was simply terrible! She was malicious and terrifying. If Shifu remained infatuated with such a treacherous woman, wouldn’t he be dragged into an irredeemable situation?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Ranran felt a bit upset and bluntly said, “Shifu, why do you have to be this way? If someone is willing to spend the money of others, maybe it’s because they like someone else. And it also doesn’t mean just because someone has money, she’ll be with them!”</p>
<p>She spoke out of frustration for a moment, but when she raised her head, she found Shifu’s gaze… was somewhat frightening, as if possessed by the Spirit Spring…</p>
<p>He stared straight at her, as if to say if she didn’t apologize, this matter wouldn’t be settled.</p>
<p>Ranran, who rarely showed her stubborn temper, was as if possessed by a stubborn spirit right this moment and wouldn’t yield to Shifu’s gaze. So after throwing out those blunt words, she calmly picked up the medicine bowl and turned to leave.</p>
<p>In other sects, it was common for their masters to worry about their young disciples being distracted by romantic feelings, which would hinder their cultivation.</p>
<p>But in their Xishan Lingxi Palace, it was all twisted around. The disciple still had to worry about whether their Elder had fallen for the wrong person.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>That night, Ranran couldn’t sleep well at all. She was slightly muddled and dreamt of Shifu and Elder Mu being very affectionate, playing the zither together in the gallery, drinking under the waterfall, embracing and kissing passionately in the water…</p>
<p>In short, all the scenes between her and Shifu were replaced by Elder Mu in her dreams… The result of that night’s dreams, if it must be described accurately, was like being fed a mouthful of dog poop.</p>
<p>As a result, Ranran felt somewhat disoriented even while eating breakfast. Even the deepest spiritual foundation couldn’t resist the depressing mood brought on by the nauseating dreams.</p>
<p>However, Su Yishui seemed to have forgotten about how his defiant little disciple had made him angry. Early in the morning, he personally went out and bought some fresh pan-fried buns from Shengji and brought them back for breakfast.</p>
<p>As Qiu Xier was eating, she noticed that the little junior sister seemed to be upset with Shifu. Although the vinegar was right next by Shifu’s hand, Ranran didn’t reach for it or dip anything in it, pouting and eating her dry bun in silence.</p>
<p>Shifu also looked tense and didn’t say a word the entire morning.</p>
<p>After breakfast, Qiu Xier secretly asked Ranran what was going on between her and Shifu. Ranran sighed softly and asked, “Senior sister, if one day, Mu Qingge becomes our Shifu’s wife, what would you do?”</p>
<p>Qiu Xier was also startled by this possibility, shivering slightly, then thought for a moment and sighed, “What else can we do? Rain falls from the sky, mothers marry off their daughters, and Shifu wants to marry a wife. These things are beyond our control! Naturally, we’ll have to save up some silver and pay the gift money. But think about it, in the past life, even though Mu Qingge’s reputation was already ruined to that extent, Shifu still ignored the controversy and sacrificed his cultivation to save her. That’s such deep affection! If Shifu finally gets what he wants and brings the beauty home, even if she’s a toxic beauty, us disciples can only congratulate our benevolent master…”</p>
<p>After saying this, Qiu Xier shivered again, then she chuckled and said, “Ranran, your little brain is quite interesting, always thinking about these and that. In my opinion, Shifu has to be crazy, if he is thinking about renewing his relationship with her now.”</p>
<p>As Ranran listened, she felt like she had indeed gone off track, and Qiu Xier’s perspective was more open-minded.</p>
<p>Whoever Shifu likes, whether they are demonic or celestial, that is his own business. What right did she, as a disciple, have to sulk and be at odds with Shifu?</p>
<p>Qiu Xier was right; she was being too nosy! So by the afternoon, she couldn’t continue to be sulky with Shifu. She found an opportunity and awkwardly talked with Shifu for a few sentences.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Su Yishui wasn’t the petty type of elder. Seeing his disciple took the initiative to extend an olive branch, he seemed to have been waiting for this for a long time and tried very hard to continue the boring and dry topics of conversation that she brought up.</p>
<p>After a few such instances of conversation, the relationship between master and disciple seemed to be fine again, without a trace of the previous discord.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Although Ranran’s mind finally turned this corner, her mood was still not serene.</p>
<p>One time, she watched as a spider repaired its web broken by the heavy rain, feeling sorry for the busy spider, she wanted to sigh for its hard work that was in vain ; she saw the fallen petals under the pavilion and felt sad that the flowers were short-lived, causing sorrow in the mud.</p>
<p>Eventually, even the usually outgoing senior brother was infected by the melancholy of the youngest junior sister and sighed at the continuous heavy rain outside the house. Qiu Xier asked the senior brother what was wrong, and Gao Cang stared blankly at the rain outside and said, “I just feel like exhaling a deep breath like junior sister does, is… quite comfortable.”</p>
<p>Qiu Xier also felt it made sense, propping her chin on her hand and looking at the falling rain and flowers, also sighing deeply.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>However, they had come to the Capital for serious matters. Even if they were experiencing the first taste of sorrow as young people, they had to finish their business first before continuing to *indulge in being melancholy all the time.<br/>*悲春伤秋 <em>grieving in spring and sorrowful in autumn</em></p>
<p>Su Yishui needed to ask the emperor for an old book, and that wasn’t something he could easily do just by knocking on the palace gates.</p>
<p>The foundation of the Great Qi Palace was special, hiding mysterious formations. All cultivation and spiritual energy would be nullified upon entering the palace.</p>
<p>In short, it was impossible to enter the palace with supernatural abilities. Moreover, Su Yishui still carried the title of the Rebel Prince’s illegitimate son, so it was even less likely for him to just openly knock on the palace gates and call on his little Imperial Uncle.</p>
<p>Therefore, they could only patiently wait for the Emperor’s Inspection tours, temple visits, or visits to the Imperial monastery to see if they could get to speak to Su Yu.</p>
<p>After arriving in the Capital, Su Yishui didn’t seem to be in a hurry for the book. He spent days wandering around the inner river ponds of the Capital.</p>
<p>However, the compass on Ranran’s neck hadn’t moved at all, and there didn’t seem to be any unusual signs in the inner river either.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After a few days, Su Yishui finally took action, but it was to invite an old eunuch from the palace to have tea at a teahouse.</p>
<p>The eunuch seemed to recognize Su Yishui and shook his head, saying softly, “Didn’t you leave far away? It’s good to stay away from worldly affairs. Why have you come back to this place of trouble? If Madam were still here and knew you came to the Capital, how worried would she be…”</p>
<p>Su Yishui seemed to respect this old eunuch very much. He personally brewed a cup of hot tea for him and served it in front of him, saying, “After Mother passed away, her affairs were all taken care of by you, Master Zheng. Her body didn’t end up abandoned in the wilderness, thanks to your kindness. I’ve always remembered this favor.”</p>
<p>Master Zheng, the eunuch, waved his hand and said, “There’s no need to mention the past again. You’re living well now, and Madam can rest assured in the afterlife.”</p>
<p>Su Yishui continued, “There are some things of mine still in the palace. I came here to retrieve them. Has the palace been renovated in recent years?”</p>
<p>Master Zheng frowned when he heard this. “Back then, the late emperor employed experts to rearrange the Feng shui of the palace, and all the buildings were constructed strictly according to the blueprints. His Majesty is filial and hasn’t made any changes to the palace buildings except for routine maintenance.”</p>
<p>Su Yishui asked casually, “But I heard that the *Pool of Inquiry in the palace seems to have been expanded?” 问潭 <em>tan is a pool, literal Asking Pool</em></p>
<p>Only then did Master Zheng remember and nodded, saying, “If you hadn’t mentioned it, I would have forgotten about it. That was about twenty years ago when His Majesty ascended the throne. Perhaps because he was young and liked boating with his consorts on the lake, he ordered people to dig deep into the Pool of Inquiry and expanded it into Lake of Inquiry.”</p>
<p>Su Yishui nodded, “Is the study of His Majesty still the same one used by the late emperor?”</p>
<p>Master Zheng nodded, “It hasn’t changed; it’s still that one… I remember when you were summoned by the late emperor to the study. I thought the recognition of your ancestry was imminent, but I didn’t expect the Prince Ping to… ahem, let’s not mention the past. Nowadays, no eunuchs are allowed to serve in His Majesty’s study. The only two palace maids who can enter are both mute, and he only sees them for official business with court ministers or when summoning talents from the Yi Ren Hall…”<br/>*异人馆 <em>Yi Ren Guan, Hall of Extraordinary Humans</em></p>
<p>Su Yi Shui narrowed his eyes and said, “Yiren Hall? I’ve heard that the Emperor values talents and has sought many extraordinary people and events. I wonder if that is true?”</p>
<p>The old eunuch looked at the bustling crowd below the Teahouse and then at Su Yishui in his gauze hat. He whispered, “Indeed. To the east of the palace, there’s a garden known as Yiren Hall, where the Emperor has gathered talented individuals. Whenever there’s a new person, especially one of great talent, they occasionally get the opportunity to enter the palace and meet the Emperor… Oh, by the way, tomorrow a prominent figure is coming to the Capital, and the Emperor seems eager to meet him. Yesterday, he even sent a palace entry token to Yiren Hall…”</p>
<p>Having received this information, Su Yishui thanked the old eunuch and Ranran saw her Shifu gracefully give the eunuch a note worth a hundred taels of silver. The eunuch initially refused but eventually accepted it, putting the note into his sleeve, and then warned, “The Battle Goddess is also staying in the palace now. I suggest you leave soon.”</p>
<p>It seemed that this old eunuch had experienced the turmoil in the Capital years ago and was acquainted with Su Yishui’s mother.</p>
<p>After saying this, the old eunuch left.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Yiren Hall?</p>
<p>Ranran felt that the term was somewhat familiar, suddenly remembering yesterday when she was eating buns at Shengji and overheard the neighboring table mention it. They said that carriages had been arriving frequently at Yiren Hall recently, indicating the arrival of many talented individuals. However, despite the influx of newcomers over the years, there had been no expansion of Yiren Hall, which was puzzling.</p>
<p>At the time, Ranran couldn’t make sense of it, but now she understood the what was it about.</p>
<p>Su Yishui stood up and said to Ranran, “Let’s go.”</p>
<p>Ranran obediently followed behind her master and went to the Teahouse near the city gate, spending quite some time there again.</p>
<p>After Ranran had eaten two plates of chestnut cakes, a tall, dark-faced man of eight feet entered the city. He didn’t queue up but instead showed the palace guards his waist token, then led his attendants straight into the city.</p>
<p>Su Yishui got up and left with Ranran, calmly following behind the tall man and his entourage.</p>
<p>As they entered the streets and alleys, Ranran felt the surrounding airflow suddenly solidify. Her Shifu immediately set up a spiritual shield, and when the tall man turned around, with a quick and precise motion, Su Yishui swiftly incapacitated the man with a flick of his finger, and his attendants were also swiftly subdued.</p>
<p>Ranran widened her eyes, unsure if her Shifu had turned to banditry.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui bent down to remove the waist token from the tall man and found a letter of invitation from Yiren Hall.</p>
<p>According to the letter, this person was named Baoming, a disciple of Master Suiyun, skilled in controlling beasts. Therefore, he had received an invitation from Yiren Hall to serve the emperor.</p>
<p>Ranran noticed the animal-like claw in the broad sleeve of his right palm, resembling a colorful leopard, which was indeed extraordinary.</p>
<p>Seeing a person with a human body and animal-like attributes made her inexplicably think of the woman who merged with the fish at Wangxiang Pass.</p>
<p>Could it be… that Baoming also knew the forbidden technique of Seven Evil Transformation?</p>
<p>“Shifu… what exactly are you planning to do?” Ranran couldn’t help but ask.</p>
<p>Su Yishui extended his right hand and silently looked at it. After a moment, his slender palm turned into a leopard’s claw. However, this was just a common illusion.</p>
<p>His skills were fundamentally different from the man’s strange arts.</p>
<p>He looked at it repeatedly and then said, “This illusion can’t be maintained for too long. We need to be quick.”</p>
<p>Ranran had a hint of what he was planning. It seemed that her master intended to impersonate Baoming and enter Yiren Hall.</p>
<p>At this point, Su Yi Shui took out a box of oil paint he had bought on the way and handed it to Ranran, asking her to darken his face and use the beard he had cut from the unconscious Baoming.</p>
<p>After the beard went on, the man who was originally elegant and ethereal like an exiled immortal just turned into a big, dark-faced, bearded man, looking… very much like a bandit.</p>
<p>As she applied the beard, Ranran, who had never done such deceptive acts, couldn’t help but express her concern, “Is this really okay?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui looked down at the slightly pouting girl and mildly asked, “If you think it’s not okay, why help me?”</p>
<p>Ranran lowered her eyes and said softly, “I trust Shifu’s character…”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui smirked slightly and his tone turned cold as he replied, “I’ve never claimed to be a good person.”</p>
<p>Ranran quickly glanced at him and muttered softly, “Following a good person to learn goodness, following a tiger to learn to bite…Shifu, if you get closer to people with noble character, your actions will naturally become more righteous…”</p>
<p>Since Shifu liked someone like Mu Qingge so much, even with a naturally good character, he will probably learn bad things. Ranran was trying to influence her master positively, hoping that her older shifu wouldn’t become bad, learning bad things from bad women.</p>
<p>This time, Su Yishui glared at her and didn’t say anything more.</p>
<p>As for the unconscious ones, Su Yishui didn’t leave them lying in the street but found an inn. He helped them inside, claiming they were drunk, and rented a room for them to continue sleeping. Also this way, they wouldn’t be discovered so soon, avoiding any exposure of their plan.</p>
<p>Su Yishui then transformed himself, Ranran and the others into Baoming and his attendants and went straight to Yiren Hall to carry out their plan.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Yiren Hall on the east side of the palace didn’t look particularly remarkable from the outside, with an old gate and did not even have a signboard. Su Yishui had to ask passersby to confirm that it was indeed Yiren Hall.</p>
<p>This “Yiren Hall” was actually established by the common people of the capital. It wasn’t part of the government’s administrative departments.</p>
<p>However, looking at the people coming in and out of the gate, it was clear where the name “Yiren” came from.</p>
<p>The thin old Taoist who had just entered didn’t move his feet when walking, as if being pushed by the wind, and floated into the gate.</p>
<p>There was also a woman with a full crown and a faint golden color, clearly someone who had also formed a cultivation core.</p>
<p>As for the others, it was also evident that they all had some foundation in cultivation.</p>
<p>Apparently although the entrance looked dilapidated with moss-covered walls, inside was magnificent, with exquisite food and beautiful servants. The Emperor generously supported these talented individuals with gold and silver, and if one could stay there, they would no longer aspire to become immortals.</p>
<p>Ranran was actually quite curious. Even if the Emperor valued talents greatly, it seemed unnecessary to keep so many extraordinary individuals in the Capital. People from the secular world, even if they admired cultivation, usually only sought longevity. It would be more practical to have more alchemy furnaces in the Capital to create longevity elixirs!</p>
<p>Su Yishui examined the gate slowly as Yu Chen walked over and knocked on the door handle.</p>
<p>The door didn’t open immediately. Instead, someone inside asked, “Who’s there?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui bowed and said, “Baoming from Suiyun Mountain, here by invitation.”</p>
<p>With this bow, he subtly revealed his transformed leopard-patterned claw.</p>
<p>The person inside saw it and after a moment, they invited him and his attendants in.</p>
<p>The one receiving them was the elderly man who had floated into the gate earlier. Upon closer inspection, Su Yishui noticed that the man’s left and right eyes were different. His right eye had a black iris, while the left one showed a faint golden color.</p>
<p>He stared keenly at Su Yishui wearing the gauze hat and slowly said, “May I ask, Sir, can you remove your hat?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui took off his hat, revealing a… dark hairy face.</p>
<p>The old man looked at his face, then at the leopard claw he had transformed, paused for a moment, and then smiled slowly, “Before, when the corpse from Wangxiang Pass who transformed into a fish was presented, I wondered if the Seven Evil Transformation Technique, which has long been lost, truly existed. Now that I see you, I believe it. I’m sure the Emperor will be greatly pleased with your talents.”</p>
<p>Su Yishui replied mildly, “You flatter me. May I know your name, Sir?”</p>
<p>The old man replied, “I am the person in charge here. You may call me Old Feng. The Emperor has been waiting for you for some time. After I report back to him, you may enter the palace for an audience.”</p>
<p>After saying this, he instructed his attendants to lead Su Yishui and his group into a courtyard to the southwest.</p>
<p>After they entered the room, Yutong was about to speak when Su Yishui made a gesture for silence. He then walked around the room and pulled out a few talismans from under the bed and ceiling beams.</p>
<p>Ranran had received many spirit talismans from Elder Jiu, so she recognized these as Sound Transmission talismans.</p>
<p>The voices of people inside the room could be heard clearly by the person who had placed the talismans. Understanding this, Ranran immediately spoke clearly, “Master, obtaining the Emperor’s favor, your future prospects will be boundless.”</p>
<p>Su Yishui said mildly, “The Palace is not a place for those from rural backgrounds like you lot to enter. After I enter the Palace later, you will go to the market and buy some food and drinks for me. I’m afraid the cooks here won’t know my taste, and I might not like the food.”</p>
<p>With this arrangement, when Old Feng led Su Yishui into the palace for an audience, Ranran and the others had a reasonable excuse to leave Yiren Hall.</p>
<p>Ranran couldn’t help but worry when she thought about how her Shifu would enter the Palace alone. Her master had been adamant that she must remain by his side. However, when it came to entering the lion’s den, he left her behind and went in alone.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>
<p>What level of misunderstanding have we got here? <br/>Xue Ranran being jealous and disapproving of…’herself’…<br/>Yet this is really the better, and also more entertaining way ( for us haha ) </p>
<p>And for our poor Su Yishui… for him who already thought that his Master Mu Qingge never had him in her heart in her past life, to hear Ranran telling him that he probably had no chance even if he was rich, must really hit him where it hurt…</p>
<p>And yet he got up early the next day to buy her more of the pan fried buns Ranran loved to butter her up is just so …..<em>*insert your own emoji*</em>!!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">李代桃僵  SEND IN THE DECOYS</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>It’s said that the foundation layout of the palace holds profound mysteries, and when powerful individuals enter the palace, their spiritual powers are suppressed.</p>
<p><em>That malicious Mu Qingge is also in the palace. If by any chance she instigates Emperor Suyu against my Shifu…</em></p>
<p>Ranran became more and more worried. Just then, the little Vermilion Bird jumped onto her head again, hopping around and asking for peanuts.</p>
<p>Ranran looked at the little bird and suddenly had an idea.<em> Why didn’t she think of this before!</em></p>
<p>She reached out and tied a talisman to the Vermilion Bird’s foot, then patted its head and said, “Be good, go to the largest courtyard in the Imperial city. If my Shifu is in danger, come back and inform me immediately. Remember, don’t get too close to the soldiers with swords and weapons. I’m afraid your abilities won’t work inside the palace either, and if you’re caught and caged, it will be disastrous.”</p>
<p>After entrusting the bird with these earnest instructions, Ranran let it fly away. She then sat cross-legged in her room, connecting with the Vermilion Bird and using its eyes to observe the situation in the palace.</p>
<p>The Vermilion Bird quickly flew over high rooftops, and with its bird’s eye view, Ranran saw Su Yishui being led by palace attendants towards the palace gate.</p>
<p>The little Vermilion Bird was quite a lively one, circling in the air from time to time and darting around curiously. It flew to the west side of the palace at one point.</p>
<p>Ranran could hear what sounded like furious cursing coming from a palace building on the west side.</p>
<p>When the little Vermilion Bird stopped on a branch by the window, Ranran could clearly see a disheveled woman smashing things and cursing, “What kind of rubbish useless elixirs? Why hasn’t the scar on my face healed?”</p>
<p>Ranran focused her gaze and was startled because the woman was none other than Mu Qingge! After all this time, her facial scars hadn’t healed properly. Although they had scabbed over, they were still deep red, marring her once beautiful face, just like Wen Hongshan…</p>
<p>Ranran remembered how Wei Jiu’s claws had once torn open the Black Flood Dragon, so his claws were dipped with its blood. Perhaps it was due to the blood of a spirit beast that Mu Qingge’s wounds couldn’t heal.</p>
<p>But after she gave Qin Xuanjiu the medicated ointment, she had specifically asked her Shifu, and he had said that the medicine could neutralize the Black Flood Dragon’s poison and heal the wounds?</p>
<p>Ranran tried hard to recall the ointment she had made. It was indeed effective, even on herself and senior brother, who had been bitten by Immortal Devouring Bugs multiple times. After applying it, not a single scar or mark was left.</p>
<p><em>Why didn’t it work on Mu Qingge?</em></p>
<p>Ranran did not know that Mu Qingge had thrown away the medicated ointment sent by Qin Xuanjiu. She couldn’t help but wonder if there was something wrong with her concoction.</p>
<p>Although she detested Mu Qingge, the medicine she gave was genuine. If Mu Qingge had used it, at least the wounds on her face wouldn’t have festered like this…</p>
<p>Just then, a palace maid spoke tentatively, “Battle Goddess, the place has been cleared at Hui Xiang Spring for you tomorrow . They say soaking there can heal scars miraculously. You should go there more often; it will certainly benefit your wounds.”</p>
<p>Mu Qingge said coldly, “Let me try. If it doesn’t work, I’ll skin you alive!”</p>
<p>Watching the disheveled Mu Qingge scolding the palace maid angrily, and remembering that this woman might be liked by her Shifu, Ranran felt quite distressed and didn’t want to see anymore.</p>
<p>Just then, the little Vermilion Bird flapped its wings again, chasing after Su Yishui. It finally landed on a branch outside the study, peeking inside.</p>
<p>As Su Yishui had anticipated, Emperor Su Yu was indeed receiving the “Bao Ming” whom he valued highly in the study.</p>
<p>However, when Su Yishui entered the study, guards came to search him and signaled for him to wait in the outer chamber, not allowed into the inner chamber.</p>
<p>At that moment, behind the heavy pearl curtains, a refined male voice slowly came through, “Is the gentleman Bao Ming waiting in the outer chamber?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui bowed slightly with clasped hands and said, “Indeed.”</p>
<p>Seeing that he didn’t kowtow, a eunuch nearby scolded sharply, “How dare you not kneel and pay respects to His Majesty?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui remained standing steadily, showing no intention of kneeling. The eunuch was about to reprimand further when the man inside the chamber said indifferently, “Cultivators view wealth and status lightly. In the eyes of the gentleman, all beings are equal. I, like any other, do not care much for worldly etiquette… Since the gentleman has come, it seems you agree to my previous proposal.”</p>
<p>Su Yishui lowered his eyes and said, “Now that I’ve met Your Majesty, please clarify the proposal in person to avoid any misunderstandings from previous letters.”</p>
<p>The man behind the curtains chuckled, “Why worry about misunderstandings? Didn’t you clearly express in your letters that you’ve admired Mu Qingge for years and longed to be intimate with her? If you hand over the Seven Evil Transformation Curse, perhaps I’ll arrange for you to meet, whether you can succeed then depends on your abilities.”</p>
<p>To outsiders, Emperor Su Yu appeared to highly regard his former benefactor, Mu Qingge. But the man behind the curtains spoke of Mu Qingge as if she were a trivial item, easily given away as a reward.</p>
<p>Su Yishui hadn’t expected that the Bao Ming he is impersonating actually harbored desires for Mu Qingge’s beauty. His brows furrowed slightly at this realization.</p>
<p>Even though Mu Ranwu was a fraud, she was using Mu Qingge’s identity. Did she ever think that the “Little Yu” she affectionately called was such a despicable man?</p>
<p>He said coldly, “Mu Qingge has always been arrogant and disobedient. I’m afraid she won’t obey Your Majesty’s orders, will she?”</p>
<p>The man inside the chamber replied coldly, “You need not worry; just say whether it’s possible or not.”</p>
<p>Su Yishui had originally come here just to meet Su Yu. However, since arriving in the Capital, he had sensed something amiss. Now, meeting Su Yu confirmed his suspicions.</p>
<p>Apart from other matters, what angered Su Yishui was how this man, who seemed to value Mu Qingge greatly, casually bestowed her upon such a vulgar man. Su Yishui felt his anger rising as his tone grew even colder as he said, “Your Majesty is indeed generous. But did you ever think, when Mu Qingge helped you ascend to the throne, that she was aiding such a despicable person!”</p>
<p>After saying this, Su Yishui suddenly moved, swiftly rushing into the inner chamber and grabbing the man behind the curtains by the neck.</p>
<p>Although the palace’s Trigram foundation could suppress spiritual abilities, Su Yishui had started martial arts training at seven and became a disciple of the great hero Yan Fei at fourteen. His martial arts skills were exceptional.</p>
<p>Before anyone could react, he had swiftly leaped and captured Su Yu.</p>
<p>Defeat the enemy by capturing their leader. As long as he held Su Yu, everything else would be easier.</p>
<p>However, when Su Yishui looked at the trembling Su Yu in his hands, he was momentarily stunned.</p>
<p>The Bao Ming he impersonated was fake, but he didn’t expect this Emperor behind the curtains… was also fake!</p>
<p>Although this young man resembled Su Yu greatly, Su Yishui recognized at a glance that he was only about seventy to eighty percent similar, a mere stand-in.</p>
<p>At that moment, all the doors and windows in the study suddenly closed, thick smoke billowed from the corners of the room, and from outside the room, a light laughter came from a sedan chair, “I am after all your little Imperial Uncle. Your defiance and readiness to fight at the slightest provocation is really like your father…”</p>
<p>Su Yishui’s voice came from inside the study, “When did you discover my flaw?”</p>
<p>The person inside the sedan chair chuckled, “You’ve met Old Feng, who is the Divine Master Feng Thirteen. The Leopard Claw created from illusion spell couldn’t deceive his eyes.”</p>
<p>Su Yishui said coldly, “So you’ve seen through me early on but still led me here?”</p>
<p>“After so many years apart, I’ve missed you. Let’s sit down and chat. But since your wild nature is hard to change, don’t mind if I calm you down a bit?”</p>
<p>As they spoke, wisps of green smoke rose from the study’s golden tokens, seeming to have their own consciousness as they hurriedly slipped through the cracks in the study.</p>
<p>At that moment, Su Yishui suddenly burst out from the rooftop, using martial arts lightness skills to dash towards a high tower in the palace.</p>
<p>At this moment, the Vermilion Bird perched on a tree branch outside the Imperial Study blinked its small black eyes, faithfully relaying the happenings in the study to Ranran.</p>
<p>The Vermilion Bird wanted to continue watching, but when Feng Thirteen, with his yin-yang eyes, happened to glance at it, he quickly turned his head, his eyes gleaming with excitement. He suddenly pounced towards the tree, preparing to catch the Vermilion Bird.</p>
<p>But the Vermilion Bird had already taken to the skies, avoiding the many arrows shot by Feng Thirteen on his orders, swiftly flying out of the palace.</p>
<p>Seeing the Imperial Study sealed off, Ranran jumped up with agitation. These people had acted swiftly and skillfully; it was clearly a trap that had been set.</p>
<p>The old man with yin-yang eyes was indeed capable. Not only did he see through her Shifu early on, but he also saw through the Vermilion Bird’s disguise.</p>
<p>Her Shifu was trapped alone in the dangerous situation of the palace, powerless now. Wouldn’t this make him vulnerable, at the mercy of others?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As she recounted the situation inside the palace to her Uncle Masters, both of them were also extremely worried.</p>
<p>Yu Chen immediately declared, “Even if we break into the palace, I will rescue our Master!”</p>
<p>Yu Tong, calmer than her brother, only said in a deep voice, “Our Master instructed me earlier that if he doesn’t return by dawn tomorrow morning, I must take the few of you and leave the Capital. After sending you away, I will join my brother to enter the palace and rescue our Master.”</p>
<p>Gao Cang said, “I won’t leave. I’ll stay and rescue our Shifu with you!”</p>
<p>At that moment, everyone was ready to sacrifice for their cause, but Ranran knew that sheer enthusiasm wouldn’t solve the problem.</p>
<p>This wasn’t an ordinary secular palace; it was a dangerous place designed specifically for Cultivators.</p>
<p>The group of scattered immortals kept in the Yiren Hall was likely just the tip of the iceberg, and Su Yu probably had numerous minions among the exotic beings.</p>
<p>If even their Shifu had fallen into jeopardy, then their unprepared group would be like moths to a flame upon entering the palace, exterminated with one blow, with no hope of rescuing their master.</p>
<p>However, Ranran had never seen Su Yu nor understood his character, making it challenging to plan how to save their master.</p>
<p>In some ways, Yu Tong was as stubborn as Qin Xuanjiu, with a rigid mindset. Since their Master had instructed her to escort Ranran and the others out of the city at dawn, there can be no compromise.</p>
<p>However, after they returned yesterday, it seemed they were being watched. Now, the entire courtyard was surrounded, and the annihilation of the Xishan sect seemed imminent.</p>
<p>But Yu Tong remained calm. She led everyone to an abandoned small courtyard in the house, pushed open a cabinet inside, revealing a hidden passage.</p>
<p>As they descended the underground passage, Ranran discovered a secret resting chamber along the way.</p>
<p>Seeing the dusty items inside, she speculated that someone had hidden here many years ago, evading pursuit. However, when Ranran’s torchlight revealed claw marks on the walls, it was chilling, as if this place had once held… a trapped beast.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Following this hidden passage, which had been dug who-knows-when, they emerged outside the city limits.</p>
<p>“This is a refuge tunnel my Master dug twenty years ago. I didn’t expect to use it today. You should return to Western Mountain now; Master forbids you from any delay on the road,” Yu Tong instructed before turning back.</p>
<p>Shortly after they left the city, the city gate finally opened. Old Feng with his Yin-Yang Eyes was leading a search, seemingly looking for Su Yishui’s accomplices.</p>
<p>Ranran thought her Shifu was meticulous; even their escape plan had been arranged thoughtfully. But when it came to himself, how had he fallen into the Emperor’s trap so foolishly?</p>
<p>Yet, considering the saying about *<em>a tiger may doze off and fall asleep</em>, if her Shifu had a momentary lapse of judgment and fell into the Emperor’s trap, it wasn’t entirely impossible.<br/>*老虎还有打瞌睡的时候   : 再厉害的人也会有疏忽的时候 <br/><em>Even the most powerful person might be negligent sometimes</em></p>
<p>Thinking back to the unusual atmosphere she sensed in the Capital, this place before her was filled with inexplicable danger and strangeness.</p>
<p>Although her Shifu’s instructions were clear, she would never abandon him alone and flee!</p>
<p>Gao Cang and Qiu Xier also hesitated. Qiu Xier suggested, “The city is currently hunting people everywhere. Going back would be walking into a trap willingly… Maybe we can find our Shifu’s friends and see if anyone can help us rescue him?”</p>
<p>After saying this, they looked at each other. Apart from Zeng Yi from Cha Ming Mountain, their Shifu had almost no friends. Where could they find someone to help him?</p>
<p>In fact, Ranran already had an idea a while ago. She calmly said, “For now, one of us must sneak back into the palace to find out our Shifu’s whereabouts before we can plan further.”</p>
<p>Gao Cang frowned, “The palace is an impenetrable iron-clad fortress ; even the little vermilion bird almost got caught flying in. Now that our Shifu has been tricked by the Emperor, it’s probably as difficult as ascending to heaven to break in again!”</p>
<p>Ranran had already figured out a way when they were going through the underground passage. “Old tricks can still work. We will just use a decoy again, like Shifu did.”</p>
<p>Qiu Xier blinked, “Are you going to impersonate one of Bao Ming’s female disciples?”</p>
<p>Ranran shook her head, “I’m going to impersonate Mu Qingge!”</p>
<p>Tracking the Emperor’s movements wasn’t easy, but Mu Qingge, staying in the West Palace, had a predictable routine.</p>
<p>Yesterday, when the vermilion bird was spying, Ranran had overheard Mu Qingge planning to visit Huixiang Springs outside the city.</p>
<p>Now, with no other choice, Ranran decided to try her luck and see if she could find a breakthrough by finding Mu Qingge.</p>
<p>Although the wound on Mu Qingge’s face had already stopped bleeding, it was leaving a red mark, which naturally make her anxious.</p>
<p>It was said that the Huixiang Springs south of the capital had a miraculous effect on healing. With the information gleaned from the vermilion bird, Ranran planned to wait at the springs and seize the opportunity. At worst, if she could capture Mu Qingge, she could negotiate with her to exchange for Su Yishui from the Emperor…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>With this plan in mind, Ranran hurried with her senior siblings without stopping, to Huixiang Springs to the south of the city.</p>
<p>Gao Cang and Qiu Xier now followed their junior sister’s lead. Even if Ranran told them to poke at a hornet’s nest, these two would do it without hesitation. Ranran’s mind worked differently, and they trusted her judgment without doubt.</p>
<p>Su Yu valued talents, and for War Goddess, he granted her the appropriate standing.</p>
<p>With a luxurious carriage and a long procession, even three extraordinary beings were assigned to escort her.</p>
<p>However, this bathing place for the nobles in the city, while guarded, still had blind spots and hidden corners.</p>
<p>Yu Tong originally wanted to use light body technique to leap over the walls, but Ranran said it was too risky.</p>
<p>Su Yu had many extraordinary beings working for him, and among the three escorts, there might be someone with extraordinary insight like Old Feng. It was better not to use spiritual power when infiltrating here.</p>
<p>Seeing carts of firewood being transported daily to the bathhouse, Ranran took advantage of her small size and blended into the pile of firewood. Meanwhile, Gao Cang and Qiu Xier kept watch outside.</p>
<p>The outer area of this bathhouse was easy to blend into, but the inner part where Mu Qingge was located was trickier.</p>
<p>Ranran noticed that the young and pretty maidservants shuttling back and forth in the bathhouse. She swayed her figure, lightly sneaking into the servants’ quarters, changed into a maidservant’s attire, and quietly slipped into the inner side of the bathhouse’s steam room.</p>
<p>Her light body technique had reached an incredible level. Even without spiritual energy, her steps were light and agile. With clever movements, she moved like a feather, dodging guards and sneaking into the open-air bath where Mu Qingge was soaking.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge seemed to dislike interruptions and was resting with closed eyes, but the moment Ranran entered, she immediately sensed something was amiss.</p>
<p>She waved her hand, summoning the sword placed beside her, and directed it to attack Ranran.</p>
<p>If it was in the past, Ranran would have been unable to dodge the sword and would have been pierced by it.</p>
<p>However, when Ranran looked at the swiftly approaching sword now, it was like watching a slowly drifting feather. Without thinking, she reached out and caught the blade with two fingers.</p>
<p>As she firmly caught the sword, even she was surprised: why did Mu Qingge seem weaker than when they were on Tianmai Mountain?</p>
<p>When Ranran pushed the sword away and pressed her small dagger against Mu Qingge’s throat, Elder Mu’s eyes widened in disbelief.</p>
<p>Although Ranran had undergone the marrow-cleansing pool, it was unlikely for her to surpass Mu Qingge by such a large margin!</p>
<p>“How did you sneak in here?” Mu Qingge asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>Ranran replied softly, “Hello, Elder Mu. There is poison on the blade of my knife. If you make a big move and accidentally cut yourself, I’m afraid your face will add a few more scars.”</p>
<p>Mu Qingge glared at Ranran but forced a smile. “What do you want?”</p>
<p>Ranran took out a golden talisman and placed it on Mu Qingge’s forehead, immobilizing her slightly, then got straight to the point, “Where has the Emperor locked up my Shifu?”</p>
<p>Mu Qingge was stunned by this and said, “What are you talking about? Su Yishui was captured by the Emperor?”</p>
<p>Evidently, she was unaware of this before and, after a moment of shock, relaxed into a smile, “Heavens, Su Yishui actually did something so foolish, rushing into Su Yu’s trap?”</p>
<p>Ranran blinked at her and said in a small voice, “Don’t smile too broadly, or your face might hit the blade…”</p>
<p>Mu Qingge finally stopped smiling. She raised an eyebrow, and said, “Su Yu is the one who caught your master. What’s the point of threatening me with a knife? Back on Tianmai Mountain, I had no choice but to try to use the Marrow Cleansing Pool to resolve the Grudge water Wei Jiu poisoned me with. If I’ve wronged you in any way, you should try to understand!”</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t buy into her hypocritical words. She softly said, “I came here to ask Elder Mu for help in rescuing my Shifu.”</p>
<p>Mu Qingge burst out laughing and insincerely replied, “Fine, I’ll agree to help you, but you need to release me first before we talk further.”</p>
<p>Ranran took out another Truth-Speaking spell talisman and stuck it to Mu Qingge’s face again. “Sorry, you’re too good at lying. I feel more assured after I question you again after placing this.”</p>
<p>Then she asked, “Do you really not know about my Shifu’s capture?”</p>
<p>Mu Qingge, with a grim face, honestly replied, “I really don’t know. I only heard that there was some commotion in the palace last night, as if an assassin had entered…”</p>
<p>Ranran asked again, “Do you know where the captured assassin is being held?”</p>
<p>Mu Qingge, was reluctant to reply but compelled by the truth talisman, explained, “If Su Yishui was really captured last night, Su Yu would likely still have him detained within the palace. Only the unique Feng Shui of the palace can suppress his spiritual power.”</p>
<p>Ranran asked once more, “Will you help me rescue my Shifu?”</p>
<p>Mu Qingge’s scarred cheeks twitched slightly. “There is no way I will help. He doesn’t care about me at all, all he has in his heart is you! I wouldn’t mind if both of you died together!”</p>
<p>Oh dear, this response was far beyond Ranran’s expectations. She was a little dumbfounded. How did Elder Mu know about the illicit incidents between her master and herself? And Elder Mu’s tone was filled with jealousy.</p>
<p>Could it be that Elder Mu had misunderstood something between Shifu and her from before, hence the jealous rage and the plot to harm her with the bugs?</p>
<p>If that were the case, didn’t she become a stumbling block in her Shifu’s romance? Their twenty years of unrequited love turned into complete despair because of her interference?</p>
<p>But now was not the time for problems with romance. Ranran had not assumed that she could persuade Mu Qingge to help rescue Shifu in the first place. She shook her head apologetically, then asked, “Do you often meet with the Emperor?”</p>
<p>Mu Qingge was already irritated; being forced to speak truthfully felt like her protective shell was being stripped away, but her mouth was not under her control. She gritted her teeth and said, “Su Yu, that bastard, is just using me. Why would he meet with me every day…… <em>Damn it</em>!”</p>
<p>Others thought the Emperor valued Mu Qingge highly, treating her like his own parent. Mu Ranwu also enjoyed this perception, proud of the vanity it satisfied.</p>
<p>But now, Mu Ranwu had to reveal that she was just someone’s pawn, especially in front of Xue Ranran. This sense of shame, was almost bursting forth from her scars.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">话未说完   UNFINISHED WORDS</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>To her utter surprise, Ranran nodded and sounded gratified, “So, Elder Mu, you know that Su Yu is not a good person. You must be wondering how I seem so much stronger than you. Actually, I think it’s because you’ve been in that sinister palace for too long, which has greatly diminished your spiritual power! As a woman, you still need to be careful… How about I free you from this burden, so that you don’t have to return to that dangerous place again.”</p>
<p>Ignoring Mu Qingge’s glaring eyes, she sealed her mouth completely and then tied her up and stuffed her into the nearby cabinet after applying a sleeping talisman.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge, under the effects of the golden talisman, wouldn’t wake up for a while. The cabinet was empty and used for decoration, so it shouldn’t be disturbed for a while. Once the people from the palace left, Gao Cang and Qiu Xier would come to deal with her, to prevent her from waking up and exposing Ranran.</p>
<p>Ranran’s figure was similar to Mu Qingge’s. Because Mu Qingge presently had injuries on her face, she always wore a veil when going in and out. So Ranran didn’t need to disguise herself further; wearing the veil would cover her face.</p>
<p>After putting on Mu Qingge’s clothes, clearing her throat, and lowering her voice to imitate Mu Qingge’s speech pattern, Ranran, was also naturally gifted with a parrot-like voice, able to imitate singing and speech perfectly. She managed to fool her way back to the carriage and returned to the palace without raising suspicion.</p>
<p>Although her imitation of the voice was quite similar, she only gave simple commands like “set off” or “go out” during the remaining time, keeping silent otherwise. In this remarkably smooth manner, she returned to the palace on the west side.</p>
<p>The Battle Goddess preferred to ride in luxurious carriages with high canopies, making several daily trips in and out, with guards and badges in place, allowing her to enter the palace smoothly. The palace guards had already grown accustomed to it.</p>
<p>As for Battle Goddess’s depressed mood and reluctance to speak much, the palace maids and eunuchs serving her also found nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>In recent days, Mu Qingge’s temper had been erratic due to her facial injuries. Her sudden silence brought relief to the attendants, and no one felt masochistic enough to approach and fawn over her.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When Ranran returned to the Western Palace and dismissed her attendants with a wave, she first took a tour of the rooms. The room was lavishly decorated, with precious jewels piled on the table, and exquisite clothing hanging on screens.</p>
<p>Ranran knew that Elder Mu loved to live in luxury, and after touring her rooms, it was indeed evident.</p>
<p>Although Su Yu was merely using Elder Mu, he was really generous. Supporting a woman like this, solely relying on Shifu’s consultation fees……it would be rather challenging. </p>
<p>Ranran pondered for a moment, then sat on the couch and tried to mobilize her true qi.</p>
<p>As Shifu said, her dantian full of true qi had dissipated the moment she entered the palace, unable to gather again no matter what she tried. However, during meditation, she could still circulate her meridians to maintain her health.</p>
<p>Ranran felt that Elder Mu really threw all caution to the wind, just to avoid the three major sects. Spending too much time in such an atmosphere would greatly damage the foundation of even someone with a high cultivation level.</p>
<p>In theory, Elder Mu, with skills not inferior to her Shifu’s, could easily establish her own Sect. However, for some reason, this Elder Mu seemed accustomed to rely on others, using them as tools or being used as one…</p>
<p><em>Was this really her true character?</em></p>
<p>Ranran couldn’t imagine how the once carefree woman, who indulged in drinking and enjoyed life to the fullest, ended up being so timid and hesitant now.</p>
<p>Thinking about this, she was even more curious about Su Yu. How cunning must he have been, to be able to manipulate Mu Qingge for two lifetimes, using her all these while?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But the immediate priority was to find out where Shifu was. Considering Mu Qingge’s words about Shifu likely still being in the palace, Ranran found it plausible. Even if she couldn’t find Shifu, she could find the spiritual spring on his neck.</p>
<p>With that in mind, she took out the small compass made by Uncle Master Zeng. Similar to the compass Qin Xuanjiu had, it could detect faint waves of energy near demonic entities.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t intend to act at night. The Great Qi Palace was too vast, and she couldn’t use true qi; moving around at night would only attract attention.</p>
<p>So, taking advantage of the rare, clear day, she put on her veil and confidently led a few palace maids to take a walk in the Imperial Garden.</p>
<p>Seeing the Battle Goddess’s figure from a distance, the scattered concubines and consorts looked at her with faint disdain.</p>
<p>After all, Mu Qingge, neither a consort nor a concubine, had taken possession of the best of everything in the palace, sharing the Emperor’s glory and favor, which naturally aroused envy and resentment.</p>
<p>Ranran hid her face in the veil, seemingly walking casually about but was actually checking the small compass hanging around her neck.</p>
<p>Shifu had the spiritual spring on him, and the compass should be able to sense some demonic energy. After walking back and forth several times, she noticed that the compass trembled slightly each time she faced the northeast direction, as if responding to something.</p>
<p>She looked in the northeast direction and saw a tall tower there, said to be where the founding heroes were honored by the former emperor, built right in the center of the Pool of Inquiry.</p>
<p>The Pool of Inquiry had been expanded twenty years ago and had become quite a large body of water.</p>
<p>However, as she was about to head towards the Pool of Inquiry  — now called the Lake of Inquiry — she was stopped by someone and informed that it was a forbidden area of the palace and not to be approached.</p>
<p>Ranran could only express her curiosity and ask why it was a forbidden area. The guards exchanged glances, and one of them, with a forced smile, said, “You know, a few days ago, an assassin came and fled to the Lake of Inquiry. In the end, he slipped and fell in. The corpse hasn’t been retrieved yet. It’s such an ominous place; you’d better stay away.”</p>
<p>Ranran knew she couldn’t get close right now. But after hearing the guard’s words, she felt her heart lurch.</p>
<p>She had to leave for now but reassured herself silently: even if Shifu had temporarily lost his spiritual power in the palace, he couldn’t possibly be drowned so easily. There must be some deception involved, and she needed to quickly investigate the anomalies in the lake…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Just as she was deeply engrossed in her thoughts, a voice filled with anger sounded behind Ranran, “Why are you still staying here? Have you been dazzled by wealth and luxury?”</p>
<p>Ranran hadn’t sensed anyone approaching, so she turned around cautiously. It turned out to be a lady in a red dress, with a bright and charming aura, standing angrily behind her. Without any reservation, she grabbed Ranran’s wrist and pulled her into a nearby pavilion.</p>
<p>“You can all leave; I want to have a chat with the Battle Goddess.” The lady in red instructed her attendants.</p>
<p>Considering Elder Mu’s tendency to provoke trouble, Ranran wasn’t sure if Mu Qingge had offended this lady before. So, she remained silent, allowing the lady to take the lead and say all she wanted.</p>
<p>Seeing no response from her, the lady in red seemed anxious and impatient, speaking in a low voice, “What’s wrong with you? Why do you insist on staying in the palace? If you don’t have a place to stay, my father has a villa in the northwest of Ancheng. You can go there and recuperate peacefully. As for the poison of the Grudge water, I will find a way to get you some herbs to relieve it. If you stay here any longer, you might be sold off without even knowing what happened!”</p>
<p>As she spoke, the lady in red acted like she wanted to throw her out of the palace immediately. But it didn’t seem like jealousy; rather, it was genuine concern.</p>
<p>From the words of the lady in red, it seemed she was an acquaintance of Mu Qingge from twenty years ago, and she didn’t seem to approve of Mu Qingge staying by Su Yu’s side.</p>
<p>It appeared she also had a deep understanding of that Emperor’s scheming, and she seemed afraid that Elder Mu would be taken advantage of.</p>
<p>Seeing “Mu Qingge” standing there blankly without saying a word, the woman in red became agitated: “I thought I had persuaded you when I saw you leaving the palace before, but why did you go to Tianmai Mountain and come back?”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran tentatively whispered in a low voice, “…Do you know that Su Yishui has been captured?”</p>
<p>The woman in red was stunned for a moment, then laughed coldly, “Isn’t that great? You’ve already died once, don’t get bewitched again. What’s the use of caring about someone who is wicked like Su Yishui? Do you think he will really change for the better just because of your wishes? He’s already rotten to the core, beyond redemption. Let him fight with the Emperor, and you stay far away from all these, that’s what’s right.”</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t expect the woman in red, a palace concubine, to have such a low opinion of her Shifu’s character. Even if she was Su Yu’s concubine, she shouldn’t slander her Shifu like this!</p>
<p>Moreover, this “dogs fighting dogs”… it seems that she doesn’t have a good opinion of the Emperor either.</p>
<p>Just then, a eunuch came over, smiling without reaching his eyes, and said to the woman in red, “Consort Jing, why have you come here? Your father, Lord Zhou, just had an audience with the Emperor and was planning to come and pay his respects to you. He’s waiting outside your palace gates.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, the lady in red, Consort Jing coldly glared at the eunuch, then turned and left quickly.</p>
<p>But her gait was not like other palace concubines, who walked delicately like lotus flowers. Instead, she walked briskly and gracefully, almost as if she had martial arts skills.</p>
<p>As Ranran was about to head back, she saw Lin Yeting, the beloved disciple of her master Mu Qingge, being led by a eunuch to find his mentor.</p>
<p>Lin Yeting seemed to have noticed Consort Jing approaching Mu Qingge earlier. After paying his respects to his mentor, he knowledgeably said, “Consort Jing’s father, although holding a high position as Minister of War, but both father and daughter are really rigid in thinking. It’s been said that Minister Zhou Dao has been reprimanded by His Majesty several times recently, indicating a loss of favor… Before she entered the palace, it seemed she had a good relationship with you, Master, so I dare to speak up and advise you to keep them at arm’s length, lest you be burdened by these two father and daughter…”</p>
<p>Ran Ran immediately understood upon hearing this. This Consort Jing’s father, Zhou Dao, was actually the former superior of General Qin Xuanjiu, who guarded the Wangxiang Pass.</p>
<p>When someone used the incident of soldiers from Wangxiang Pass throwing themselves into the river to accuse General Qin Xuanjiu, it was this Minister Zhou Dao who strongly vouched for him.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Dao and the treacherous Prime Minister Lin have always been enemies. Now, Lin Yeting is taking advantage of the situation to sow discord, obviously working hard for his father.</p>
<p>Xue Ran Ran naturally had a strong aversion to the Lin family’s father and son. Although they had never worked together, she had long sensed their foul stench.</p>
<p>Moreover, if Lin Yeting continued to follow her around, she would not be able to act freely.</p>
<p>So, Ranran tightened her throat, imitated the voice of Elder Mu, and coldly said Shifu’s one-worded mantra: “Get lost!”</p>
<p>After saying that, she turned and walked towards her palace without looking back.</p>
<p>Although Lin Yeting also knew that his master had been extremely irritable these past few days, he never expected her to be so blunt in rebuking him today, leaving him dumbfounded for a moment.</p>
<p>But later, he realized that Consort Jing Zhou Feihua was once a close friend of Mu Qingge, so he suddenly understood that his words just now were too careless, possibly causing displeasure to his master.</p>
<p>Although he had upset his master, Lin Yeting was not too alarmed.</p>
<p>Did she really think she was a god-like figure? Although she was highly honored by His Majesty, that favor being withdrawn one day would catch her off guard.</p>
<p>Although he called that woman his master, it was at his father’s behest, to monitor her closely. Did she really think he, the son of a high-ranking Prime Minister, was someone at her beck and call?</p>
<p>Master Lin, unable to restrain himself, snorted coldly and turned to leave as well.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After returning to the West Palace, Ranran dismissed the attendants and prepared to change into a neat outfit, waiting quietly for the night to come.</p>
<p>With nothing else to do, she crossed her legs to meditate, hoping to calm her mind so she could discern her Shifu’s voice amidst the noisy sounds near and far in the palace. But no matter how carefully she listened, she did not a sound from her Shifu.</p>
<p>However, she did catch some unrelated voices.</p>
<p>She heard her so-called “beloved disciple” Lin Yeting seem to be whispering not far from the West Palace: “That old man Zhou Dao doesn’t know how to appreciate favors, he is quite stubborn and unwilling to move voluntarily. He might need a lesson… I heard that the Emperor has been favoring Consort Jing for several nights in a row… With this, Lord Zhou might have a chance to turn things around because of his daughter!”</p>
<p>Another eunuch with a high voice said, “If the Lord Chancellor is worried about this, it’s easy to handle. Recently, Consort Jing’s cousin also joined the Forbidden Army. They grew up together like childhood sweethearts… If the young master is interested, there’s a drinking session in the barracks tonight, a chance…”</p>
<p>The rest of their conversation was too soft for Ranran to hear clearly.</p>
<p>Right now, her sole focus was on rescuing her Shifu. Palace intrigue and power struggles were not her concern, so even though she heard it, she didn’t pay it much mind.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Soon, night fell, and Ranran silently calculated the time for the changing of guards in the Western Palace. Taking advantage of the shift change, she lightly jumped onto the roof from a window and swiftly headed towards the northeast tower.</p>
<p>Thanks to her Shifu’s strict training, even without using her Qi, her footsteps were light and agile. As she approached the tall building near the Lake of Inquiry, her small compass on her neck trembled violently. Ranran felt ecstatic; perhaps her Shifu was being held captive there.</p>
<p>When she stopped on the last roof, she saw a large open space ahead, with the high tower built in the center of the Lake of Inquiry. The island around it was surrounded by lush greenery and deep waters. The Forbidden Army around seemed wary of the lake, avoiding it from a distance, as if there were ferocious beasts inside.</p>
<p>She had used the eyes of the Vermilion Bird before and saw her Shifu rushing towards that high tower. Adding that to the words of the guards during the day, could it be that her Shifu had really fallen into the lake and hadn’t come out since?</p>
<p>Under the cover of night, Ranran crouched on the roof like a bat, avoiding being seen by distant observers. She closed her eyes and tried to focus, quickly hearing a strange gurgling sound coming from the depths of the lake.</p>
<p>Amidst the low, deep gurgling of the water, there seemed to be a hint of painful whimpering, that voice…… resembled her Shifu!</p>
<p>Ranran’s eyes widened in shock. Could it be… Shifu was imprisoned underwater?</p>
<p>At that moment, soldiers changing shifts seemed to be talking. A leader-like figure asked, “Any unusual movements from the Winged Immortal today?”</p>
<p>The person being asked replied, “Much calmer compared to yesterday. Didn’t that assassin fall into the lake by himself yesterday? The Immortal seems satiated today, behaving quite calmly without surfacing. Plus, you saw it hasn’t rained today.”</p>
<p>The leader spoke in a low voice, “You mustn’t be careless. If the Immortal fully awakens, the entire Capital’s foundation will be overturned. We must feed it on time and check the lake for tremors regularly…”</p>
<p>Ranran was bewildered. She suddenly remembered something about the inner river and the recent continuous heavy rain in the capital. Could there be something deadly hidden beneath the palace’s lake?</p>
<p>If so, was Su Yu insane? Concealing such a sinister creature in the palace, if anything went wrong, wouldn’t it affect everyone in the city? And what did they mean by feeding captured individuals to the Winged Lord? Could they be referring to her Shifu? Had her Shifu been captured and fed to that lake-dwelling monstrosity?</p>
<p>If Su Yu indeed kept some evil creature, similar to the Immortal Devouring Bug, it would require nourishment from someone with deep spiritual energy.</p>
<p>In many ways, her Shifu Su Yishui, was a perfect delicacy! The thought of Shifu possibly being fed to an evil creature made Ranran’s heart feel like it was about to explode.</p>
<p><em>Shifu, were you really killed by the tyrant this way??</em></p>
<p>Ranran took pause, knowing she still had a chance to sneak out of the palace, but approaching that deep pool could lead to her being devoured by whatever lurked inside.</p>
<p>However, the whimper from her Shifu that Ranran was certain she had heard earlier, he might be underwater struggling right this moment!</p>
<p>According to Elder Mu, Shifu escaped yesterday and jumped into the lake. If Shifu hasn’t come out yet, then Shifu must still be underwater…</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Ranran actually felt no fear. She had always been someone who, once decided on something, she wouldn’t look back.</p>
<p>If Shifu had really perished under the water, she would risk everything to retrieve even a piece of his bone…</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, she prepared to jump down, but before she could leap, she felt a chilling presence behind her.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Slowly turning, Ranran saw Su Yishui standing there beside her, dripping wet, staring at her with his beautiful eyes.</p>
<p>Ranran held her breath, examining her Shifu from head to toe – complete and unharmed, not missing any arms or legs. Yet, there was an indescribable eeriness about him.</p>
<p>She was about to speak when Su Yishui gestured for her to go down from the roof and quickly led her along the ridge to a nearby palace.</p>
<p>Compared to previous emperors, there were not many consorts in Su Yu’s palace. This palace near the lake seemed abandoned for a long time, covered in dust.</p>
<p>As they entered the room, Ranran tried to grab her master’s wrist to check his pulse. This was a skill Su Yishui had taught her for discerning people. External appearances could change with illusions, but pulses remained consistent, especially her master’s, which was unique.</p>
<p>But when she reached out, her hand passed through Su Yishui’s body, piercing through his waist.</p>
<p>The person before her was not Shifu but merely an illusion… similar to how the spirit spring had once conjured Mu Qingge’s image at the military platform.</p>
<p>But this illusion of Su Yishui frowned sternly, “Why are you so disobedient? Didn’t Yutong send you all out? Why did you sneak into this place?”</p>
<p>If it were a demon’s illusion, how did it know about her Shifu’s orders to her Second Uncle Master?</p>
<p>Ranran stared at the illusion in a daze, her lips trembling as she whispered, “Shifu… are you dead?”</p>
<p><em>Could it be that Shifu had died too tragically, and now his spirit was lingering to appear before her?</em></p>
<p>Perhaps to fit with his disciple’s imagination, the man before her exuded a chilling and sinister aura, “Even if I am not dead, you’re close to driving me to my grave.”</p>
<p>Ranran was almost choked up, whispering, “Shifu…”</p>
<p>It would seem that Su Yishui did not want to scare his little disciple out of her wits, so he said in a low voice, “I can’t leave the palace right now, but there’s no immediate danger to my life. My movements are restricted, so I had to detach from my primordial spirit to meet you this way. How did you get into the palace?”</p>
<p>Ranran whispered, “I tied a charm to the foot of the Vermilion bird and saw you falling into the Emperor’s trap, getting captured… How can I go back with peace of mind? Even if I have to fight to the death, I must save Shifu……”</p>
<p>Hearing this, not only did Su Yishui not feel his disciple’s filial piety but he reached out to grab her shoulder, though his hand couldn’t touch her at all.</p>
<p>He tried to rein in his anger, emphasizing every word, “<em>I forbid it. Don’t you dare die</em>!”</p>
<p>Ranran was somewhat stunned by the inexplicable hatred in his eyes. Blinking at Su Yishui’s spiritual form, she dared not speak.</p>
<p>She seemed to have touched her Shifu’s sore spot again. At this moment, she was a little afraid of her furious Shifu.</p>
<p>Su Yishui also realized he had frightened Ranran. Seeing how she was shrinking a little from him, he did his best to take a deep breath, trying to calm the agitation in his heart.</p>
<p>Having sacrificed most of his core cultivation to the divine spell, he was highly sensitive to this spirit fruit that is Ranran and her unique aura, which was why he recognized her existence when they first met in Juefeng Village.</p>
<p>Just now when he was underwater, he woke up abruptly when he sensed Ranran’s aura, and conjured his spiritual form to find her.</p>
<p>However, this method of separating the soul consumes even more than Beast-Taming Arts, and he cannot sustain it for too long.</p>
<p>So, he spoke in a low voice, “Early tomorrow morning, find an opportunity to leave the palace and quickly return to the West Mountain…… It’s my fault, if I had known that the Capital was so dangerous, I would never have brought you here. Also, be extremely careful of Su Yu… He…”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>
<p>I am excited about this Consort Jing! She seems to have insight into Mu Qingge’s feelings for Su Yishui from her first lifetime and things looks really promising since she seems to have alot of tea to spill <em>hehe</em></p>
<p>Meanwhile Su Yishui is helplessly seeing Ranran once again placing her life in danger for him, when he cannot be at her side to protect her… <em>why is life so difficult</em>?</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">潭底秘密   THE SECRET BENEATH THE LAKE</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Su Yishui hadn’t finished speaking, but it seemed like his spiritual energy was depleting. His figure began to blur gradually, his voice trembling to the point of being inaudible. Before he could finish his words, he suddenly disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>Ranran waited silently for a while, but the surroundings remained quiet. She couldn’t see her Shifu’s spirit form anymore, indicating that his spiritual energy wasn’t sufficient to sustain the illusion, causing it to vanish.</p>
<p>She cautiously moved to the side and looked down through the window. Under the moonlight, the rippling waves of the lake, her Shifu should be underwater in that area…</p>
<p>Ranran let out a quiet sigh of relief. At least for now, it was clear that Shifu wasn’t in immediate danger. Moreover, her master had been very furious just now, and if she didn’t listen to him, she might be expelled from the sect even sooner than her second senior brother.</p>
<p>For now, she could only retrace her steps back to the West Palace and plan further when daylight came.</p>
<p>However, as she turned back, she passed by a palace area and heard a familiar high voice, “Quick, carry him to Consort Jing’s bed. Empress Jing is used to practicing sparring before bed. She’s not in her palace now. When the Chief Steward of the Imperial Palace comes to deliver the plaque later, you know what to do, right?”</p>
<p>The voice speaking was none other than the eunuch who had whispered with Lin Yeting during the day.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Ranran, standing on the roof, couldn’t help but stop in her tracks.</p>
<p>Although she wasn’t familiar with palace intrigue, she understood what was being said now. It seemed like Lin Yeting had conspired with some despicable eunuch to drug Consort Jing’s cousin when he drank, render him unconscious, and prepare to place him on her bed.</p>
<p>Both the eunuch and the palace maid in Consort Jing’s palace had been bribed, and Consort Jing was currently practicing martial arts in the arena, providing the perfect opportunity for the scheme.</p>
<p>When Consort Jing returned and the eunuch from the Emperor’s chamber arrived, someone would inevitably discover the man in Consort Jing’s chambers. At that time, it would lead to exposing Consort Jing’s affair with her cousin, cementing her reputation as an unfaithful concubine.</p>
<p>This matter didn’t concern Ranran directly; it was just another tragic injustice in the deep palace.</p>
<p>Ranran continued quickly towards the West Palace. As she walked, she overheard Consort Jing speaking softly with a eunuch in a corner of the palace’s martial arts training ground.</p>
<p>“My father said that the internal river and the palace’s lake are connected. If there’s something suspicious, we should check the lake as well. Did anyone see a body float up after someone fell into the lake the other day?”</p>
<p>The eunuch also whispered, “There are always people guarding around the lake. I couldn’t get close… Lord Zhou has been investigating for so long without any clues. Maybe the rumors about monsters in the river are just that, rumors.”</p>
<p>Consort Jing shook her head, “This matter is of great importance. We can’t rest easy until we get to the bottom of it. Go and prepare what I asked you to prepare…”</p>
<p>After dismissing the young eunuch, she began to wield her long sword under the palace lights.</p>
<p>Consort Jing’s swordsmanship wasn’t just for show; she moved with agility, and her sword whistled as it struck, the floral patterns on her sword swaying around her agile body…</p>
<p>This kind of swordsmanship was almost reaching the realm of “Dao,” carrying an air of righteousness. It would take a lot of effort to achieve such mastery.</p>
<p>Ranran first eavesdropped on their conversation about the lake and then got captivated by Consort Jing’s skills. She couldn’t help but stop and watch, becoming increasingly fascinated.</p>
<p>She thought of General Qin Xuanjiu’s injustice in the past and how Minister Zhou Dao of the Ministry of War spoke up for him. This Consort Jing is the youngest daughter of General Zhou Dao, known for her straightforwardness. If she were falsely accused of adultery, it would be difficult for her to clear her name after being set up.</p>
<p>Although Ranran did not have any deep friendship with her, when Consort Jing had inexplicably scolded her in the pavilion during the day, Ranran had felt an unexplainable liking towards her.</p>
<p>She recalled the conspiracy she accidentally overheard, hesitated for a moment, and decided to meddle more and help this soon-to-be-wronged Consort Jing.</p>
<p>So, Ranran quickly moved to the roof beside the training ground, watching the nimble sword dance of the woman. She pricked her finger, quickly wrote a message on a torn piece of her inner garment, “There’s a man in your bed. Please deal with it quickly.”</p>
<p>After writing, she checked it, finding it concise and to the point, she wrapped the cloth around a stone and threw it towards Consort Jing.</p>
<p>After throwing it, she planned to leave quickly. Unfortunately, she underestimated the skills of this lady of the palace. Consort Jing had already pinpointed the location where the stone was thrown with lightning speed, intercepting Ranran at the roof’s edge.</p>
<p>Ranran reacted quickly, flipping down, narrowly avoiding Consort Jing’s sword tip.</p>
<p>However, dodging one attack led to more sword moves following.</p>
<p>Ranran was a bit dumbfounded; she had managed to pass through one difficult situation after another before so smoothly. She didn’t expect that her one moment of kindness would expose her true identity to Consort Jing.</p>
<p>If she had her spiritual power, she had a hundred ways to defeat Consort Jing, but now, in the palace, she was no different from an ordinary person. Looking at Consort Jing’s robust muscles revealed by her short sleeves… hmm, she had no chance of winning.</p>
<p>Consort Jing glared at the young girl in black standing before her. She had now pressed the sword tip against the girl’s neck, rendering her unable to move.</p>
<p>Consort Jing lifted the cloth wrapped around the stone, shaking it off and revealing the message. Her eyes widened as she coldly asked, “Who are you? What does this message mean?”</p>
<p>Ranran weighed the urgency of the matter, carefully gesturing for the lady to speak softly, and then whispered, “I am a junior of General Qin Xuanjiu, here to report a conspiracy against you by someone.</p>
<p>She wasn’t lying. If they considered Mu Qingge’s connection, she was indeed Qin Xuanjiu’s nephew disciple, a legitimate junior.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Qin Xuanjiu’s name, Consort Jing loosened the short sword at Ranran’s neck slightly and asked coldly, “Who is trying to harm me?”</p>
<p>So Ranran briefly explained about Lin Yeting buying off the eunuchs in the palace.</p>
<p>As for whether Ranran was telling the truth or not, it was quickly confirmed. With a glance from Zhou Feihua, her two maids and a trusted eunuch quickly returned to her palace.</p>
<p>They first tied up all the duty maids staying in the palace tonight, then found her cousin who was unconscious on the bed, clearly drugged.</p>
<p>Next, the eunuch swiftly moved the unconscious cousin to another location.</p>
<p>With Ranran’s warning, everything was resolved smoothly. Before the emperor’s men arrived, the abnormality in the palace was cleared.</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua was quite bold. Faced with the card sent by the emperor’s trusted aide, without a change in expression, she calmly stated that she wasn’t feeling well and couldn’t accompany the king tonight, requesting the emperor to pick another concubine.</p>
<p>The eunuch didn’t mind at all. It seemed that Consort Jing had given the emperor the cold shoulder before. He raised a string of colorful wind chimes in his hand and said, “His Majesty heard that you have been feeling unsettled lately and your sleep hasn’t been good. He specially ordered the eunuch to select this string of wind chimes from the Western Regions as a tribute, to hang by the window so you can sleep more peacefully.”</p>
<p>After saying that, the eunuch went and hung the wind chimes by the window.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Once she dismissed the eunuch sent by the emperor, Zhou Feihua touched with the wind chimes a little while.</p>
<p>The Emperor’s favor was like these wind chimes, beautiful but not practical. It looked good but was of no real use, only creating more enemies for her in the palace.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, those jealous women didn’t think about why a favored concubine for over a decade hadn’t borne any children.</p>
<p>After dealing with the bribed palace maids and eunuchs, Zhou Feihua returned to her palace to assess Ranran. Ranran had just been released from her restraints and was kneeling in front of Consort Jing, rubbing her wrists.</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua looked at her and suddenly asked, “Who are you exactly? If you don’t tell the truth, I’ll have the Chief Steward come and identify you, to see if you’re really from the palace.”</p>
<p>Ranran realized that it must have been her improper etiquette that gave away her identity to Consort Jing. She must have seen through her and recognized that she wasn’t a trained palace maid.</p>
<p>Seeing that Consort Jing was straightforward, Ranran didn’t beat around the bush and said respectfully, “Considering that I’ve helped you once out of goodwill and saved you, can you spare me this time?”</p>
<p>She then revealed her identity. When she mentioned that she was Su Yishui’s disciple, Zhou Feihua’s expression changed, but she still patiently listened to Ranran’s explanation of coming to save her Shifu.</p>
<p>Ranran kept some things unsaid and didn’t mention how she had replaced Mu Qingge and hid her in the bathroom cabinet. Zhou Feihua had a good relationship with Mu Qingge. If she had said it, Zhou Feihua might execute her on the spot.</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua didn’t know about Su Yishui’s capture before. To her, this news was worth celebrating with a few drinks.</p>
<p>However, this girl with big eyes had a good heart. Despite knowing the risk of entering the palace, she still lent a hand when she heard about someone else’s conspiracy.</p>
<p>As for Su Yishui helping Qin Xuanjiu subdue the water demon at Wangxiang Pass, her father had mentioned it before. Since Mu Qingge’s death, Su Yishui had upheld the reputation of Lingxi Palace and recruited new disciples, doing some decent deeds.</p>
<p>Dealing with matters on their own merits, this girl had risked being captured to save her. Zhou Feihua would remember this favor.</p>
<p>So Zhou Feihua thought for a moment and said, “Your master’s capture is his own fault, as he is the descendant of a rebel Prince and cannot escape death. It’s understandable that you want to save your master. I owe you a favor and will repay it. Tomorrow morning, I’ll have someone send you out of the palace. Don’t come back again, or next time I see you, I’ll have to treat you as an assassin.”</p>
<p>Ranran knew that Minister Zhou was upright in his official duties, and his daughter’s character wouldn’t be bad. If she said so, she would do it.</p>
<p>However, she didn’t understand why Zhou Feihua hated her Shifu so much. Was it because her Shifu had stood by and watched while Mu Qingge was besieged, even playing a role in it?</p>
<p>But when Zhou Feihua heard Ranran’s question, she laughed mockingly, “If only it were just a matter of character. You’re such a kind-hearted girl, how did you end up with such an evil master…” She stopped there, refusing to say more, and waved to arrange for Ranran to leave the palace at dawn.</p>
<p>But Shifu was still in the palace. How could Ranran leave?</p>
<p>Shifu had appeared to her using his soul form, indicating that he was trapped by something.</p>
<p>It was very likely that he was worried about her safety, so he tricked her into leaving first. If Zhou Feihua sent her away, it would be difficult for her to come back into the palace.</p>
<p>Ranran’s mind raced, and she suddenly remembered Zhou’s earlier instructions to investigate the matters of the lake and she came up with an idea. She spoke up, “Actually, my Shifu had sensed something strange in the boundaries of the Capital. The root of it lies within this palace. Unfortunately, he didn’t have time to investigate thoroughly before being imprisoned. If I leave now, wouldn’t it be giving up halfway?”</p>
<p>This statement indeed caught Zhou Feihua’s attention. She narrowed her eyes slightly, “Su Yishui also detected it? What did he find out?”</p>
<p>Ranran thought of her little compass and recalled how Su Yu had expanded the Pool of Inquiry into a big lake twenty years ago. Add that to her master falling into the lake and not coming out. All the mysteries pointed to the Lake of Inquiry.</p>
<p>Perhaps only by entering the lake could all the mysteries be solved. So Ranran, daringly, said, “There are demons in the Lake of Inquiry. If your Ladyship wants to find out the truth, I’m willing to go into the lake to investigate.”</p>
<p>When she was about to jump into the lake just now, her Shifu had appeared in his spirit form to stop her right at that moment. He did not allow her to enter the lake. The more he did this, the more determined Ranran was to find out the truth. Even if her Shifu were to expel her from the sect, she wouldn’t leave him alone at the icy cold bottom of the lake.</p>
<p>Seeing her determination, Zhou Feihua thought for a moment and then slowly spoke about what she knew.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>It turned out that Zhou Feihua had been secretly investigating the anomalies in the Capital. Just a month ago, one of her father’s old subordinates returned from a night banquet and almost fell into the inner city river. At that time, he said he saw a huge creature emerge from the water, dragging the servant who was supporting him into the river with one gulp.</p>
<p>The old subordinate was so frightened that he immediately snapped out of his drunken state. Since Zhou’s official residence was not far from the incident, the old subordinate had stumbled his way over and desperately knocked on the door of Zhou’s mansion.</p>
<p>After Zhou Dao listened to his incoherent account, he immediately sent people to search the river. However, even after alarming the city prefect and despite mobilizing the district office and numerous fishing boats, they found nothing.</p>
<p>If there really was a huge creature in the river as the old subordinate said, with such a large-scale search, it would have been discovered long ago. </p>
<p>The district office concluded that the old subordinate was drunk and speaking nonsense, closing the case. As for the missing servant, he was ruled as a run-away slave.</p>
<p>But Zhou Dao believed his old subordinate’s words. He had picked up a shell-like object by the riverbank that looked extraordinary, not like a common item.</p>
<p>However, it seemed someone didn’t want him to investigate further. Three days later, the old subordinate, once again drunk, fell into a ditch, broke his neck, and died.</p>
<p>His wife pleaded with Zhou Dao, stating that it was the death anniversary of her mother-in-law, and her husband, being extremely filial, would never drink and revel on such a day, especially after the scare he just experienced. Why would he get so drunk again? Lord Zhou felt that something was amiss. He quietly hired people to search for clues.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, recently, it seemed he had fallen out of the royal favor, as the Emperor hinted that Zhou Dao should retire. If he resigned, he would have to return to his hometown, and this matter would be left unresolved.</p>
<p>Now, when Zhou Feihua heard Ranran confidently mention suspicious activities in the lake, she couldn’t help but ponder. Because she knew that the water in the lake came from the inner river.</p>
<p>Could it be… that the man-eating monster was under the lake in the Imperial palace?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When Ranran expressed her desire to investigate the lake, Zhou Feihua hesitated. “That place is a forbidden area in the palace. One of the emperor’s beloved consorts accidentally fell into the lake, causing the Emperor extreme grief. Since then, palace personnel are forbidden from approaching.”</p>
<p>Thinking Zhou Feihua was being apprehensive, Ranran tilted her head and said, “I’m not a person from the palace. Even if His Majesty investigates, it won’t implicate you, Your Ladyship.”</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua looked at her and suddenly laughed self-deprecatingly. “I never thought that after so many years in the palace, I would waste all my skills and become such a timid person. I am the one who wants to find out the truth, how could I put a little girl like you at risk? Your name is Xue Ranran, right? I’ve heard about you. You were the winner at the Marrow-Cleansing Pool this time. You were able to pass the test of the Great Dun Tian, just like Qingge back then, a rare talent. Won’t it be a pity if something happened to you in the palace lake?”</p>
<p>It seemed that Zhou Feihua was also someone who valued talent.</p>
<p>Ranran clasped her fists and said, “Shifu is the person who is kindest to me. Now that he’s alone and has no one else, who else can save him aside from me? Even if it’s a dragon’s pool or a tiger’s den, I will still venture into it!”</p>
<p>As she spoke, Ranran’s gaze was resolute, and her small face exuded an indescribable charm. For some reason, Zhou Feihua, in a trance, seemed to see another person in this young girl.</p>
<p>That person had been sitting on the top of a tall tower, looking at the dawn in the distance, smiling and saying, “He’s alone, and has no one else. Unless I give him a hand, who else would be willing to save him?”</p>
<p>That time, Zhou Feihua and “her” drank together all night on the high tower. At the farewell, Zhou Feihua never expected that it would be the last time they would meet…</p>
<p>When she heard that Qingge was reborn, Zhou Feihua was extremely ecstatic. Later, she had  looked forward to Qingge entering the palace. But when the two met again, the once close friends who could drink together all night had become very distant.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge politely explained that she had lived on a tree for twenty years, and many old memories were hard to recall.</p>
<p>With change, their deep-seated friendship of the past seemed to not have borne fruit with the turning of the cycle of life.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Zhou Feihua sighed lightly, ending her inexplicable sadness. From this impetuous young girl, she seemed to have regained the heroic spirit of her youth.</p>
<p>She smiled and said, “Since you’re not afraid of death, why not accompany me? Let’s find out what secrets are hidden in the lake.”</p>
<p>After they agreed on their plan, Ranran asked curiously, “I heard that during the construction of the Great Qi Palace, an expert had guided it, so there are things buried under the foundation that can suppress spiritual power. Perhaps, that’s why the monster hasn’t caused trouble?”</p>
<p>As she said this, she fingered the small compass around her neck, lost in thought, and then looked at the birds chirping outside the window.</p>
<p>When Zhou Feihua turned around, the young girl standing by the window had disappeared, leaving only a clear voice floating in, “Consort Jing, I’ll go on ahead. If you trust me, we’ll meet again by the lake at midnight…”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran’s light skills were excellent. Seizing the opportunity while it was still dark, she finally made her way back to the Western Palace.</p>
<p>She changed into Qingge’s clothes and then picked up pen and paper, quickly drawing for a while on the paper. When the outline was formed, she exhaled slowly, folded the paper, sealed it with wax, ready to send it out of the palace at the right opportunity.</p>
<p>During the day, she had to pretend to be Qingge. Only at night could she venture into the lake to find out the truth.</p>
<p>In fact, Ranran still had doubts and worried that Consort Jing might betray her.</p>
<p>But when midnight arrived, as she lay on the eaves, she saw Lady Zhou Feihua, dressed in black, appear at the agreed place. She knew then that this Lady’s credibility was as reliable as her swordsmanship.</p>
<p>With Zhou Feihua’s help, approaching the lake for the second time became much easier.</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua knew the time when the guards changed positions around the lake. After the second watch of the night, she took advantage of the wind direction, used a packet of sleeping powder provided by her confidant to incapacitate the guards around. </p>
<p>They then changed into diving attire. After exchanging a glance, they jumped into the water with a splash.</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua was an excellent swimmer, but in the darkness of night, it was pitch black and impossible to see under water.</p>
<p>She took out a night pearl to illuminate the surroundings. It was said that this pearl was a reward from the emperor himself, a testament to Consort Jing’s favor.</p>
<p>With the light from the pearl, they continued to descend, and Ranran’s thoughts grew heavier.</p>
<p>Because in such a large lake… there wasn’t a single fish! The layout of the palace’s water bodies always followed Feng Shui principles, and there should have been auspicious creatures like koi inside.</p>
<p>However, after descending for so long, holding a night pearl that would easily attract fish, the water was eerily silent, like dead water.</p>
<p>Ranran sensed something was wrong. She looked around but saw nothing unusual. She was about to signal Zhou Feihua to ascend when she saw Zhou Feihua, seemingly startled, wide-eyed, gulping water with bubbles forming around her mouth.</p>
<p>Following her gaze, Ranran turned her head and her pupils contracted sharply. She forgot to hold her breath for a moment and almost choked on the water.</p>
<p>Because following the dim light of the pearl, at the bottom of the pool, there was a huge creature coiled there—a dragon with complete scales and horns!</p>
<p>At first, the creature’s figure was blurry, but under the reflection of the night pearl, its body seemed to emit a faint glow of scales, gradually revealing its full appearance.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it seemed to be in a deep sleep, lying motionless at the bottom of the water.</p>
<p>And the dragon’s body was coiled around something, when Ranran took a closer look, she realized that was a person—long hair flowing like black waterweed in the water, the face also illuminated by the light reflecting off the scales, it was clearly her master, Su Yishui!</p>
<p>However, Shifu’s eyes remained closed, seemingly in endless slumber.</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua had choked just now and had to surface. Just then, the dragon slowly opened its eyes, and through its narrow slits, shone a golden light that Ranran felt was inexplicably familiar.</p>
<p>As the dragon stared at her, Ranran found herself unable to move. She could only watch as the massive dragon head slowly approached her. Its swaying whiskers even touched Ranran’s body.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>
<p>What I really like about this chapter, was that when Ranran refused to listen to Su Yishui, she made that decision based on sound judgement and not just some rebellious streak. She guessed correctly that he only wanted her to leave because it was too dangerous. </p>
<p>What I usually can’t stand is headstrong female leads doing things that was illogical, just to show they are ‘strong of character’. Here, Ranran was genuinely concerned for his well being, and its funny how she thinks she is being filial but her instinct to not leave ‘Shifu’ behind was because of something else…</p>
<p>So, are you surprised that the secret is a dragon? </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">一碗鸡粥   A BOWL OF CHICKEN PORRIDGE</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Ranran desperately tried to calm herself down while also attempting to draw the mechanism stick tucked at her waist, preparing for a sudden attack from the dragon.</p>
<p>But just then, a familiar voice sounded in her ear, “So you actually know fear? A disciple as disobedient as you, I really should expel you from the sect immediately…”</p>
<p><em>This voice… It was her Shifu!</em></p>
<p>This voice, pouring into her ears, was just like how Shifu used to communicate with her through the White Tiger in secret. Ranran was certain that this dragon was communicating with her through their spiritual connection.</p>
<p>The dragon seemed to harbor no ill intentions towards her. It carefully retracted the spikes on its claws and lifted Ranran gently, as if afraid of hurting her. However, it was bound by chains, and even the slightest movement caused the chains to clatter loudly.</p>
<p>Seeing Shifu’s body entwined by the dragon’s tail, Ranran seemed to understand, her master had used beast control techniques to control this dragon, attaching his spirit to the dragon’s body. So, her master’s body at this moment was merely an empty shell without his soul.</p>
<p>As the dragon spoke, it gently lifted Ranran with its big claw and blew a bubble of water around her, enveloping her. With the bubble protecting her, Ranran could finally breathe freely underwater.</p>
<p>“Shifu, why… have you turned into a dragon?”</p>
<p>The golden dragon used its claw to hold the water bubble, and continued to transmit its voice, “This young dragon is about to mature. It had previously consumed many cultivators with formed cores but had been suppressed under the lake, unable to digest its spiritual energy, making its temperament increasingly irritable. If left uncontrolled, even the palace’s Trigram formation won’t be able to contain it. It would overturn the entire Capital, sparing no one. I’m temporarily controlling it with Beast control techniques to see if I can completely subdue it and send it back to the deep open sea.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Ranran understood. When Shifu had seen the heavy rain in the Capital and noticed something amiss by the river, he understood the root cause. That day, Shifu had pretended to be deceived deliberately, then actively fled towards the Lake of Enquiry, jumping in to control this lurking water dragon.</p>
<p>But… why did the palace harbor such a colossal beast? What did Su Yu intend by raising dragons in the palace?</p>
<p>“Su Yu’s life is nearing its end. He is raising the dragon to prolong his life,” Su Yishui explained.</p>
<p>Years ago, Su Yu was poisoned by Prince Ping xi during the succession dispute and had been saved by Mu Qingge, but his body was already damaged.</p>
<p>Although he later became Emperor, he couldn’t regain his health. It’s said that he had been seeking elixirs and medicines everywhere, eventually turning to unconventional methods when his condition worsened.</p>
<p>Ranran suddenly understood everything. No wonder Su Yu had shown great interest in the water demon’s corpse at Wangxiang Pass. He had sent many people before and after to search for clues at Wangxiang Pass and had gathered people like Bao Ming who could transform their bodies.</p>
<p>Because Su Yu’s body was already severely damaged, those so-called alchemists and cultivators couldn’t help his immediate need.</p>
<p>Emperors always referred to themselves as the true sons of dragons, but Su Yu was taking it a step further. He wanted to merge his body with a real golden dragon to gain a dragon’s lifespan of thousands of years.</p>
<p>She had heard from the eunuch that her master had brought that the lake was expanded twenty years ago. That meant the Emperor had obtained this dragon at that time.</p>
<p>But where did this dragon come from? How did Su Yu manage to transfer it to the lake?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Su Yishui knew the dragon’s origin. He said mildly, “Someone was once saved by the Azure Dragon Meng zhang from the Dragon Island in the East Sea. Unfortunately, Meng zhang was killed by… the Demon’s Son from the Nether Realm. Before dying, the Azure Dragon laid a dragon egg, which probably fell into Su Yu’s hands later.”</p>
<p>If Su Yu had initially obtained a freshly hatched baby dragon, everything could be explained. But this dragon was forced to mature, compressing what should have been a growth period of hundreds of years into twenty.</p>
<p>This young dragon has consumed too much spiritual power, growing too quickly. Perhaps the Lake of Inquiry will no longer be able to contain it any longer. That’s why Su Yu is urgently searching for the Seven Evil Transformation Spell that can absorb the dragon’s essence, wanting to gain the dragon’s spiritual power to extend his own life.</p>
<p>It is precisely because of this dragon that the Capital has continuous rainfall, nearly causing a flood disaster.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After understanding all this, Ranran tried to move the water bubble around her, floating up and down around the giant dragon’s body—opportunities to see a dragon up close are rare, so she wanted to take a good look while her master could still control it.</p>
<p>Su Yishui looked on helplessly as his disciple floated around excitedly like a jumping bean.</p>
<p>It can’t be helped; this was still an immature girl with a playful nature, which was normal… and besides, he knew that even if she grew older, her nature might become even more immature. Someone who would live their whole life being carefree and playful couldn’t be expected to act with composure…</p>
<p>“But Shifu, it has consumed so many people. Why are you risking so much to save it? Isn’t there a way to eliminate it?” Ranran asked.</p>
<p>The dragon, upon hearing this, looked deeply into the water bubble where Ranran was bouncing around like a jumping bean and said mildly, “It deserves to die indeed, but someone once made a promise to its dying mother, vowing to return the dragon egg to its ancestral Dragon Island. Unfortunately…… she also met with an accident later and couldn’t fulfill her promise. I want to fulfill her promise for her and send this dragon back. As for the dragon’s nature, it is originally neither good nor evil. Away from those who tempt it towards evil, once it is far from the mortal world, why should humans need to judge its goodness or evil?”</p>
<p>Ranran, floating on the dragon’s horn at this moment, thought her master’s words spoke into her heart! But who was that acquaintance? Probably Elder Mu?</p>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu had mentioned before that Mu Qingge had once single-handedly suppressed the Demon’s Son, averting a disaster for the world. Even that Spirit Spring, was something that had been separated from the Demon’s Son.</p>
<p>Now thinking about how the Demon’s Son could kill an adult dragon, what a terrifying ability that was!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>“Shifu, your physical body has been underwater all this time, is it really safe?”</p>
<p>Seeing Su Yishui’s body was also wrapped in a huge water bubble, Ranran worried that if anyone on the lake noticed something unusual underwater and took action, wouldn’t Shifu be unable to manage everything at the same time?</p>
<p>Because the dragon’s body was still entangled with countless chains made of mysterious iron, it seems that its movements were not entirely free either.</p>
<p>“I dare not fully unleash the dragon’s power. Once it becomes enraged, it would be too difficult to control. I can only look for an opportunity, see if I can wait until *Duanwu Zhenyang when the dragon’s demonic nature is at its weakest, then let it break free from the chains.”</p>
<p>*Duanwu Zhen yang, which is tomorrow.<br/>*端午正阳 <em>Fifth day of the fifth lunar month</em></p>
<p>Su Yishui had originally planned to take a risk, wait until noon when the sun’s energy was strongest, to unleash the dragon’s own power to break free from the chains and then control it to ascend to the sky and return to the sea.</p>
<p>After he discovered the signs in the Capital, he intended to enter the palace to investigate. When he saw scales underwater in the inner rivers, he vaguely guessed the truth.</p>
<p>Before jumping into the lake, he had explained the severity of the situation clearly to Su Yu, but Su Yu had insisted to go his own way, to use the dragon to prolong his life. So, Su Yishui had jumped into the lake and temporarily controlled the dragon.</p>
<p>Su Yu naturally knew he couldn’t keep the dragon any longer. Although he had many ways to kill the dragon underwater, he couldn’t bear to miss this chance to prolong his life, so he temporarily had no immediate way to deal with Su Yishui.</p>
<p>But the one thing Su Yishui had miscalculated, was Ranran’s unpredictable nature. She had actually controlled the vermilion bird and witnessed his capture, and even disregarded the danger to enter the palace.</p>
<p>If she were not here, he could be more reckless. But with her inside the Great Qi Palace, Su Yishui’s previous plans were all rendered useless. If he couldn’t control the dragon later, wouldn’t Ranran be in danger too?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>However, Ranran felt that her master’s physical body must not remain in the water any longer. While the vigilance was lax now, it was a good opportunity to send his physical body out of the water to prevent Su Yishui from neglecting one for the other.</p>
<p>She remembered the joints where the magnetic force was reduced that she had discovered when running around the palace earlier, so she explained it to her Shifu again in detail. After a simple agreement, Ranran pushed his physical body and surfaced the lake.</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua was waiting on the shore. But when she saw not only Ranran surfaced, but a man was also pushed out, she was surprised.</p>
<p>When she saw that the unconscious man was Su Yishui, she immediately drew her dagger, ready to slit his throat. Ranran quickly stopped her, glaring at Zhou Feihua and said, “What are you doing? If you kill my Shifu, the dragon underwater will be out of control!”</p>
<p>She briefly explained the situation underwater to Zhou Feihua.</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua also knew it was almost time for a shift change, and it was also time for those drugs to wear off, so she glared at Su Yishui resentfully, then helped Ranran lift him into a sedan chair and returned to Zhou Feihua’s palace.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After they made it back, Ranran detailed the chain of events and the current circumstances to Zhou Feihua.</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua was silent for a long time when she heard that the dragon underwater was raised by Su Yu to extend his life. She struggled to digest this information.</p>
<p>Having stayed in the palace for so long, although she had sensed that something was wrong, she still couldn’t believe that there was such a demonic beast in the palace. However, only the emperor Su Yu could successfully hide a small dragon from everyone in the palace.</p>
<p>Since Su Yu ascended the throne, he had been diligent and loved his people. If nothing unexpected happened, after his passing, he would be known as a wise ruler of his generation.</p>
<p>But he had actually done such an appalling thing,. He was practically playing with the lives of all the citizens in the Capital.</p>
<p>But thinking about it, Su Yu’s body had indeed deteriorated significantly over the years, and she was one of the few who could see him. Listening to the sound of the Emperor coughing from behind the curtain was indeed heart-wrenching, feeling like thin threads of air were being torn apart.</p>
<p>But recently, the Emperor seemed to be recovering, and his spirit and complexion had improved a lot. If what Su Yishui said was true, that this small dragon was related to Su Yu’s life extension, then everything made sense.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Zhou Feihua fell into contemplation, her head lowered, lost in thought.</p>
<p>In fact, Ranran didn’t expect Zhou Feihua to be of much help. If it weren’t for the delicate situation her Zhou family was in at court, Zhou Feihua’s first priority would probably be to consider how to help the Emperor live longer and healthier?</p>
<p>At this moment, Zhou Feihua self-mockingly smiled and said, “The reason I entered the palace back then was because Mu Qingge entrusted my Zhou family to diligently guard the king. At that time, she said she had altered the Emperor’s destiny on her own, and would not be able to escape heavenly punishment. However the Emperor Su Yu she saved in the nick of time, was too young and his character was still uncertain and needed someone by his side to support him well, so as not to disappoint the people of the world. I thought there was no place more convenient to do this than within the palace, so I became a consort. But later on, I became lazy, only wanting to avoid the jealousy and struggles in the palace, and also I thought that the Emperor was a good ruler who governed diligently and cared for the people. But… now the Emperor has actually done such things, it’s my failure to fulfill the task entrusted by an old friend. If things continue like this, even if my friend doesn’t blame me, I can only apologize with my life…”</p>
<p>Her meaning was clear in her words. Although she was Su Yu’s consort, in her view, she still bore the earnest instructions of Mu Qingge. Now that Su Yu had made mistakes by resorting to demonic means to prolong his life, she couldn’t evade responsibility either and must do her utmost to guide the Emperor back to the right path.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran felt her words carried deeper significance. <em>What did she mean by Mu Qingge altered destiny on her own? Wasn’t Su Yu supposed to be the destined Emperor? Then who should it be? The rebel Prince Ping?</em></p>
<p>Ranran didn’t understand the grudges of the previous generations of the Da Qi imperial family and was unable to make sense of it all at this time.</p>
<p>But what surprised Zhou Feihua more than Su Yu, was Su Yishui’s voluntary capture, just to subdue the restless dragon.</p>
<p>“When did he become so concerned about the world?” As she said this, Zhou Feihua unconsciously played with the dagger in her hand, seemingly looking for an opportunity to bypass Ranran and stab the unconscious man lying on the bed.</p>
<p>Ranran had to be on guard, sitting straight in front of her master to protect him, as she declared proudly, “My Shifu has always been such a good person, not only helping the world but also caring for his disciples and vanquishing demons everywhere. Even without high cultivation, he could become a deity through accumulated kindness!”</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua wasn’t sure about what the young girl said, because it did not match the Su Yishui she knew. </p>
<p>Her impression of Su Yishui had always been of a cold, aloof young man. So, hearing the naive words of Ranran, she couldn’t even muster a smile, saying coldly, “It’s just that you, a girl who hasn’t experienced much of the world, can’t see through his true nature… However, is it really true that he can succeed at noon tomorrow?”</p>
<p>Ranran nodded, saying seriously, “But it would be safer to find a way to unlock the dragon’s chains. The palace concubines all say that the Emperor favors you the most. People say that pillow talk is very effective, can you try to sway his favor and see if you can find a solution?”</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua, upon hearing this, smiled bitterly, “He turns his favor to me? It’s just because he wants to watch me in red clothes dancing with a sword, reminiscing about his old friend who passed. We haven’t spent a night together, so I can’t even sway his favor even if I wanted.”</p>
<p>As she said this, although Zhou Feihua’s face showed a bit of melancholy regret, there was no sign of the typical resentful abandoned concubine in the palace. It’s just that her words were a bit heart-wrenching. In that case, hadn’t she been living in the palace for the past twenty years like a widowed woman?</p>
<p>But Zhou Feihua said it was fine; she had spent these years enjoying painting and calligraphy, and her swordsmanship was even better than when she was a young girl. She was content with her life.</p>
<p>Ranran nodded, Zhou Feihua has turned the bitter years of serving in the imperial harem into a peaceful retirement life of a high-ranking official.”</p>
<p>This Consort Jing is truly a master of how to live a peaceful life.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Ranran’s admiration, Zhou Feihua smiled and said, “If given the chance, I would definitely leave this Imperial palace, roam freely in the mountains and waters, without any restraints. That would be a fulfilling life…”</p>
<p>Ranran also felt that it was a pity for someone like Zhou Feihua to be stuck in the palace, serving a sick emperor. She was very serious when she replied her, “There will definitely be a chance. When that time comes, enjoy yourself and make up for these years of owed happiness!”</p>
<p>This kind of encouragement for a consort to escape the palace was indeed rebellious. Zhou Feihua laughed heartily upon hearing it, expressing in a Jianghu manner, “I’ll take your good words as a blessing!”</p>
<p>Although their ages differed by *fourteen or fifteen years, they could still talk happily, which was quite surprising.<br/>*<em>Ranran is already 18 years old… so this doesn’t seem quite correct</em></p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Since that was the case, the two continued to discuss their cooperation. Zhou Feihua promised that she would find a way to cover for Ranran’s master until the dragon left the palace.</p>
<p>Ranran explained that the Seven Evil Transformation Spell was just a demonic technique used by the Spirit Spring to enchant hearts. Once used, it would lose one’s true self. Although Zhou Feihua hoped for Su Yu’s recovery, she couldn’t let him lose his sanity as a price.</p>
<p>If an Emperor lost his benevolence and righteousness, the consequences would be unbearable for the world.</p>
<p>After they agreed on this, the sky started to lighten up. The palace maids were still asleep, but Ranran felt hungry.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Consort Jing lived a secluded life in the palace, so there was a small kitchen with only a stove to heat water and rice, which was just right for making porridge.</p>
<p>Ranran saw chicken meat and dried scallops in the kitchen, remembering the secret recipe for  Chicken porridge from the [ Playing Classics]. She followed it and cooked a pot of thick porridge, the porridge was just the right thing to feed to her unconscious Shifu.</p>
<p>Although he was in a fasting state and didn’t need to eat or drink, considering how worn out he had been after merging with the White Tiger the last time, it was still best to have some nourishment.</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua watched as Ranran carefully fed the porridge to the unconscious man and wiped his face. Her attentive demeanor, rather than filial piety towards her master, resembled more of caring for a beloved husband.</p>
<p>While eating the porridge Ranran made, Zhou Feihua said, “Little girl, don’t be fooled by his good looks. This person has no heart. Falling for him will only lead to a bad end… This porridge is really delicious! Why don’t you stay in my palace from now on and accompany me…”</p>
<p>Just then, someone outside the palace announced, “The Emperor has arrived, Consort Jing please receive him!”</p>
<p>It turned out that Emperor Su Yu, upon hearing that Consort Jing was unwell, and specially came to check on her early in the morning.</p>
<p>Ranran’s body stiffened slightly upon hearing this, feeling like things had gone back to square one. This time, Consort Jing would be seen by the Emperor himself. And there was still a man in her bed, Su Yishui no less, which was much worse than her cousin from the Imperial Guards!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>However, Zhou Feihua remained calm. She carried the clothes from the box to place behind the screen and, together with Ranran, placed Su Yishui inside the clothes box.</p>
<p>After doing this, Consort Jing applied some powder on her face and lips, deliberately making her appearance look a bit haggard, and went to meet the Emperor.</p>
<p>Since Ranran couldn’t show herself, she hid in Consort Jing’s inner chamber, guarding her own master.</p>
<p>But before Consort Jing could leave the room, the Emperor had already pushed open her door.</p>
<p>Consort Jing greeted the Emperor quickly.</p>
<p>Separated by a brocade curtain, they heard the deep voice of a man speaking gently, “Beloved Consort, there is no need for formalities. I heard that you were unwell, so I came to check on you…”</p>
<p>After speaking, the Emperor seemed to sit at the table in Consort Jing’s outer chamber.</p>
<p>On the table was the chicken porridge Ranran had just cooked, still emitting steam.</p>
<p>Consort Jing had to graciously offer it, saying to the Emperor, “I had the kitchen just make this porridge. If Your Majesty is hungry, would you like some.”</p>
<p>Ranran and two palace maids knelt in the inner chamber, she peeked through the brocade curtain with curious eyes, sizing up the Emperor Su Yu, whom she had only heard of but never seen.</p>
<p>The man sitting at the table had a gentle demeanor, bearing some resemblance to the impersonator.</p>
<p>However, no matter how well-trained the impersonator was, he couldn’t exude the noble elegance of a true royal. This Emperor, was definitely different, radiating an imperial aura.</p>
<p>And Ranran also noticed that this Su Yu actually bore a slight resemblance to his nephew Su Yishui in his eyes and brows, looks like they are both descendants of the imperial Su family.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Su Yu couldn’t maintain the youthful appearance of Su Yishui, so the signs of aging were evident around his eyes and brows. His pale skin and tall, emaciated figure also indicated his ailing condition.</p>
<p>Noticing the fragrant porridge, Su Yu seemed genuinely hungry and smiled, “Consort Jing’s kitchen seems to cook better than my royal kitchen. The smell of this porridge is quite special.”</p>
<p>A eunuch beside him had already scooped some porridge into a bowl from the pot and tasted it first. It would appear that Su Yu was very vigilant; even if it was food from the beloved Consort, he still needed the eunuch to taste it first.</p>
<p>Usually, it was enough that the eunuch would only taste a little, to check for poison.</p>
<p>But today, after tasting a bit, the eunuch couldn’t help but scoop up a large spoonful and gulped it down, eating rather voraciously.</p>
<p>The eunuchs who served before His Majesty, apart from a bowl of plain porridge before going on duty, dared not eat anything substantial, lest they commit the offense of farting or burping in front of His Majesty.</p>
<p>So this eunuch who was tasting the food was truly hungry. Suddenly, he tasted this incredibly delicious chicken porridge that melted in his mouth, and couldn’t help but finish all the porridge in the bowl…</p>
<p>After finishing the bowl, he realized his indiscretion and was scared, falling to his knees and waiting for the Emperor’s punishment.</p>
<p>Su Yu chuckled, curious about the taste of the porridge that made the tasting eunuch forget etiquette. He took the bowl that Consort Jing had scooped for him from the pot, stirred it with a spoon, and then took a sip… The Emperor’s charming smile froze for a moment, then slowly chewed and swallowed the porridge, finishing the bowl just like the eunuch had…</p>
<p>“Beloved Consort, who made this porridge?” he asked suddenly Zhou Feihua while eating.</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua was stumped. She replied a little distractedly, “It was made by the servants in the kitchen.”</p>
<p>The Emperor looked at her with a smile, “Summon the person here and let her dictate the recipe. I’ll write down the recipe and give it to the royal kitchen staff so they don’t keep making food that doesn’t please me.”</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua hadn’t expected the conversation topic to turn here, so she felt caught off guard.</p>
<p>Ranran had not expected the Emperor to also be a food enthusiast, asking about the porridge recipe in the middle of the night. Just then, the steward eunuch beside the Emperor had already summoned the palace maid from the kitchen.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>
<p>I was wondering how did Su Yishui use the Beast Taming technique if he cannot use any spiritual power? Don’t cultivators lose access to their spiritual powers once they enter the palace? <br/>I am quite confused about this part…</p>
<p>However, it appears that the suppression is not absolute. Perhaps the lake is too vast and might be a place where the forces are weak? Otherwise the dragon would also be unable to influence the weather with its rain summoning abilities right?</p>
<p>Also, Su Yishui’s empty shell is still ‘alive’ but his soul is out with the dragon. But since he still had to use a bubble to keep himself breathing, it seems that other bodily functions are still there. So he can still swallow when he is unconscious? I am also confused by this part lol</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">不老之身   ETERNAL LIFE</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>The palace maid was very frightened, thinking that the porridge was not to the Emperor’s liking, so he had summoned her to inquire about it.</p>
<p>However, she didn’t cook the porridge at all. If she confessed hastily, she would face the punishment of death by beheading.</p>
<p>So she glanced at the inner chamber and happened to see Ranran behind the brocade curtain. She immediately bowed and said, “Your Majesty, this porridge was cooked by that palace maid. I truly don’t know the recipe for this porridge!”</p>
<p>Su Yu smiled as he listened, then casually glanced at the little maid behind the brocade curtain who had kept her head bowed.</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua glared fiercely at the indiscreet kitchen maid, then asked directly, “Your Majesty insists on asking about this porridge. Is there anything wrong with it? If it’s not good, I will punish the palace maid severely. Guards, take her away and give her a beating!”</p>
<p>Ranran was not someone from the palace, and Zhou Feihua was worried that her identity would be exposed, so she wanted to preemptively take her away under the pretext of punishment.</p>
<p>But just then, the man with the yin-yang eyes, Old Feng, suddenly appeared at the door. When Su Yu waved his finger, Old Feng, with a murderous aura, walked towards the inner chamber.</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua stood up abruptly, blocking Old Feng, and coldly said, “Your Majesty, allowing a man from outside the palace to enter my inner chamber may not be appropriate, right?”</p>
<p>Old Feng was not very polite, trying to push past Zhou Feihua. But Zhou Feihua was not a weak person! When Old Feng made a move, she quickly countered, giving him a hard slap that made him take a few steps back.</p>
<p>Su Yu watched, his smile unchanged on his face, and said in a gentle tone, “Beloved Consort, what are you doing? Is there something in the inner chamber that you’re afraid I’ll find out?”</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua was about to reply, but in that moment, Old Feng flicked a flying insect with his hand. It fluttered over and bit Zhou Feihua’s neck.</p>
<p>With just that one bite, Zhou Feihua’s body went weak, and she collapsed on the ground.</p>
<p>Ranran, being sharp-eyed, saw the insect and felt a sudden tightness in her chest. That flying insect… why did it resemble the Immortal-devouring Bug from Tianmai Mountain?</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Feihua fell, Ranran quickly glanced at the positions of the window and the door, estimating her chances of escape.</p>
<p>Old Feng curved his lips and said, “Miss, you should know the power of this insect. If you don’t cooperate, I still have plenty of insects here. If I miscalculate and drain your spiritual power, don’t blame me!”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Estimating nearly no chance of escape, Ranran became more composed. She stood up and honestly replied, “It was me who made it. If Your Majesty finds it unsatisfactory, I will make it again. Why make such a fuss?”</p>
<p>At this moment, Old Feng also saw Ranran and whispered to Su Yu, “Your Majesty, I’ve seen this young lady before. She came to Yiren Hall with Su Yishui, disguised as Bao Ming. It seems she’s Su Yishui’s disciple.”</p>
<p>Although she wore a veil at the time, Old Feng’s yin-yang eyes were sharp enough to see her face through the thin fabric.</p>
<p>Su Yu’s eyes were fixed on her, his smile seemingly fading a bit. After a long while, he said, “It’s been many years since I had such delicious chicken porridge. The last time I had it was over twenty years ago… You’re Su Yishui’s disciple, Xue Ranran, right?”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran was rather taken aback that the Emperor knew her by name. She couldn’t help but ask, “Your Majesty, how do you know my name?”</p>
<p>Su Yu looked at the beautiful young girl in front of him and said mildly, “I also know that your mother found you on the Peak of the Immortal Platform and raised you by her side until Su Yishui took you in as his disciple.”</p>
<p>Ranran recalled  that Mu Qingge had investigated her before, involving even the officials, so it wasn’t so surprising that Su Yu knew these things.</p>
<p>But why were these people all so curious about her parentage? Could she really be the daughter of some powerful figure?</p>
<p>She looked at Su Yu, who was in his thirties and could theoretically be her father, and asked directly, “Your Majesty, why are you so curious about my parentage? Am I perhaps Your Majesty’s missing illegitimate daughter ?”</p>
<p>Su Yu’s reaction to this question was similar to Su Yishui’s, somewhat displeased.</p>
<p>He leaned back slightly, a wry smile on his face. “Am I old enough to be your father now? You used to always call me ‘Xiao Yu.'”</p>
<p>Ranran was confused momentarily. This “Xiao Yu” wasn’t unfamiliar to her, it seemed like Mu Qingge used to call him by that name. But when had she ever called the Emperor “Xiao Yu”?</p>
<p>Could it be that the Emperor was confused by his illness and speaking nonsense?</p>
<p>Seeing Ranran’s puzzled expression, Su Yu waved his hand for a eunuch to bring a comfortable chair for her to sit and talk.</p>
<p>Seeing Ranran politely decline the tea brought by the eunuch, he just smiled slightly. “It seems Su Yishui hasn’t told you yet, that you are in fact a spirit fruit from the Rebirth Tree.”</p>
<p>Ranran was stunned. She had never thought that she, like Master Mu Qingge, had fallen from an Immortal Tree.</p>
<p>The fruit of the Rebirth Tree was a sign of immortal cultivation. Mu Qingge was from a generation of magnificent demonic cultivators, but what about her? Who was she?</p>
<p>She thought of Mu Ranwu, who had perished with Mu Qingge back then, and remembered her mother saying that when she was born, there was a “Ran” character in the palm of her hand. Suddenly, she made a connection.</p>
<p>Could it be that she was the reincarnation of Mu Ranwu, who had caused the death of Master Mu Qingge? If so, had she met this Emperor in her previous life?</p>
<p>For some reason, Ranran didn’t want to know about her past life.</p>
<p>She was content in this life. She had loving parents, a Shifu who dotes on her, and good senior siblings. If she hadn’t come to the Capital, she would have no regrets in this life.</p>
<p>She had no wish to be associated with Mu Qingge at all. Otherwise, she would owe her a life from her past life. And in this life, she would have to acknowledge a malicious elder sister and repay the debts from before……</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Seeing Ranran remain silent, Su Yu was now certain that Su Yishui had probably never told her about her origins.</p>
<p>He smiled knowingly. “Fate is unpredictable and I did not expect this either. *Flowers are not flowers, mist is not mist. Things are fleeting. Do you want to know who you are?”<br/>*花非花雾非雾  比喻所咏之物的短暂易逝，难持长久 </p>
<p>Ranran shook her head, looking at Su Yu. “Since it’s a reincarnation, it means starting anew after falling from the tree. Who I was before is no longer important. I’ve been Xue Ranran all this while, and that’s good enough. Why bother knowing who I was in my past life?”</p>
<p>Su Yu didn’t expect her to be so straightforward and cut off what he intended to say.</p>
<p>But this was always her true self, always able to take things up and let go, impossible to grasp like the wind.</p>
<p>Compared to the woman in the West Palace who hid behind Mu Qingge’s name but engaged in shameful acts, and seemed so ridiculous.</p>
<p>Thinking of how that woman living in the West Palace, had spent so much effort pretending to be Mu Qingge, Su Yu’s lips curled with a cold smile.</p>
<p>He had actually thought that Mu Qingge had come back to find him. Unfortunately, when they first met, that woman had exposed herself accidentally.</p>
<p>Su Yu couldn’t tell if he had felt relieved or was extremely disappointed.</p>
<p>But just now, after eating that bowl of porridge and recalling the taste from the past, he felt that Mu Qingge being alive but forgetting everything wasn’t bad either.</p>
<p>Although Ranran wanted to end this topic, however in the imperial palace, he was the one who directed the conversation.</p>
<p>Since she didn’t want to face the truth for the time being, he wouldn’t force her. He just said mildly, “The people who intruded and stunned the guards at the Lake of Enquity last night, was it you and Consort Jing?”</p>
<p>Ranran knew that it must have been her and Zhou Feihua who had left some clues, which led the Emperor here.</p>
<p>At this moment, he probably didn’t know that her Shifu’s body was in the clothing box inside the room. But since Zhou Feihua and her had been exposed, if the Emperor searched Consort Jing’s palace, her master’s body would soon be discovered.</p>
<p>Su Yu would definitely show no mercy to her Shifu…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>It was already day time. She could only delay and see if she could hold out until noon. When Shifu controlled the little dragon to ascend, chaos would surely ensue in the palace, and they would have a chance to escape.</p>
<p>Thinking about this, she nodded and directly asked Su Yu, “May I ask Your Majesty, why do you want to raise a dragon in the palace?”</p>
<p>Su Yu was not surprised that she had discovered the secret in the Lake of Enquiry. He had someone serve another bowl of porridge, eating while looking at her, and recounted past events, “Back then, after the battle of Fan Yao, I asked Mu Qingge if I could cultivate immortality with her. But she looked at my face and said, ‘You cannot have both the fish and the bear’s paw; one cannot possess immense power and supreme spiritual power at the same time, or else it will incur the jealousy of the heavens. Being able to control the world and benefit the people is also a form of cultivation, but this cultivation is bitter. For a person, several decades would be enough. If one day I can let go of power, it will not be too late to seek her out again to cultivate the path of Dao.'”</p>
<p>Ranran nodded as she listened, “Although Elder Mu has become somewhat erratic now, she was not wrong. Being an Emperor is indeed exhausting…”</p>
<p>Su Yu smiled and pointed to his own hair, “I’m two years younger than your master, but now my hair is mostly gray, and my body is gradually deteriorating. The ‘several decades of power’ she mentioned are actually only about twenty years for me. This ‘little Yu’ in your eyes can now be your father. Such immense power is really not as tempting as eternal life.”</p>
<p>Ranran listened to his words and shook her head, “But isn’t your so-called method of eternal life too much of a gamble? Have you not considered the consequences if it fails, and the people of the entire Capital end up in the dragon’s belly?”</p>
<p>Su Yu smiled faintly, “What I have wanted to do has never failed. If it weren’t for Su Yishui’s interference, I would have mastered the Seven Evil Transformation Spell by now. As long as I merge with that dragon and get rid of my ailments, I can benefit the people for generations…”</p>
<p>Ranran felt something was amiss with his words, “Your Majesty, in the twenty years of ruling Da Qi, you have indeed been a good emperor. But have you ever thought about how many talented individuals you have harmed by raising that dragon? That dragon should have been a divine creature swimming freely in the sea, but you have raised it to become fierce and brutal, confined to a small deep pool, feeding on humans. Are you really sure that after merging with such a dragon, you will still be the benevolent king who cares for the world? Do the people of the world… need someone like you for generations?”</p>
<p>This question was quite audacious, and Old Feng sternly said from the side, “How bold, how dare you speak to His Majesty like this!”</p>
<p>However, Su Yu laughed out loud, “You haven’t changed at all. Even though your appearance has changed slightly, you still won’t say anything against your conscience. But it’s not your fault. You’ve forgotten everything from the past, now you’re just an eighteen-year-old girl. Those who achieve great things should not be bound by trivial matters. In the battle of Fan Yao back then, you helped me quell the rebellion of Prince Ping, and how many people died? If one only cares about the lives and deaths of a few, without considering the long-term consequences, then the person sitting on the Throne now would be the Demon’s Son from the Netherworld, and the people of the entire world would be suffering!”</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t understand what he meant and didn’t have time to think about his words. She was now only worried about her master in the box and Zhou Feihua who collapsed. She needed to delay as much as possible, so she asked softly again, “Was it Your Majesty who gave Elder Mu the Immortal-Devouring Bug?”</p>
<p>If she guessed correctly, it was the Yin-Yang Eye Old Feng who cultivated the demonic insects.</p>
<p>Su Yu seemed no longer inclined to hide the truth and nodded readily, “It was me, but I didn’t expect you to also be at Tianmai Mountain at that time. If I had known, I would never have given it to her. Fortunately, you’re alright. Otherwise… I would never spare her.”</p>
<p>As a ruler, other than being able to ignore lives of individuals, it seems there is also a strange skill of shifting blame onto others.</p>
<p>In just a few words, the blame for nearly killing Ranran on Tianmai Mountain fell entirely on Mu Qingge.</p>
<p>But from his words, it seemed that he had treated Ranran well in her past life.</p>
<p>It would seem that Elder Mu had also enjoyed the Emperor’s favor before, and that her master had warned her to be careful of Su Yu.</p>
<p>Ranran decided she should still be more cautious around this emperor. She asked uncomprehendingly, “If Your Majesty only seeks eternal life, why help Mu Qingge with such matters? Your Majesty must know that the spiritual veins left by Dun tian’s great abilities at Tianmai Mountain have been ruined and can no longer be used.”</p>
<p>Su Yu looked coolly at Ranran, “For those who can become immortals, leaving the human realm is beyond my control. But Tianmai Mountain is still within the human realm. If someone with ulterior motives managed to pass the trial and gain spiritual power from the marrow pool that should not have existed, it will be a disaster for living beings. The great Dun tian decided to have no further attachments to the human realm, so why leave behind something that tests and tempts human nature?”</p>
<p>Ranran finally understood this time.</p>
<p>She had thought that Su Yu gave Mu Qingge the Immortal-Devouring Bugs to help her improve her cultivation, but perhaps the polluted end of Tianmai Mountain’s spiritual veins was what Su Yu truly wanted.</p>
<p>If the vermilion bird had not shown its power, these out of control insects would have broken through Tianmai Mountain and defeated all the cultivators of the three major sects at the foot of the mountain in one fell swoop…</p>
<p>The land of Da Qi does not need powerful immortal cultivators like Wei Jiu and Su Yishui. By destroying those sacred places where cultivators can raise their spiritual powers and form cores, he could prevent promising cultivators from emerging again. This is the true goal of Su Yu.</p>
<p>At this moment, Ranran finally understood what her master warned her to be cautious of. These people in high positions, with their iron will and steel nerves that decided life and death like gods, are truly chilling.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran sighed and then stood up to look at the sun in the courtyard. It was almost noon, and her master should be taking action soon.</p>
<p>As the sun’s corona moved to the noon position, Ranran squinted at the dazzling sunlight slanting down and then turned to Su Yu with a fierce gaze, “Dog emperor, true strength cannot be suppressed and crushed so easily!”</p>
<p>As her words fell, there was a loud explosion from the direction of Lake of Enquiry, and a dragon emitting a faint golden halo burst out from under the lake. The chains entwined around it made tearing sounds due to the immense force pulling them.</p>
<p>Excitedly clapping her hands, Ranran righteous speech just now perfectly captured the moment, undoubtedly shocking that bad emperor!</p>
<p>Next would be Shifu’s magnificent display of power, striking a resounding blow to this dog emperor’s face!</p>
<p>In the instant when the giant dragon soared into the air, it seemed to collide with an invisible large net covering the vast sky. The entire sky flashed with a faint golden net, and after the dragon collided with the net, it seemed to be in immense pain, emitting a thunderous dragon roar before crashing heavily back into the lake.</p>
<p>All these happened in a blink of an eye from the time Ranran angrily cursed with “dog emperor”. The tremors of the failed attempt had not yet subsided and now her situation became extremely difficult.</p>
<p>She was truly infuriated by Su Yu just now, so much so that she spoke without thinking, scolding words like “dog emperor.”</p>
<p>Who would have known that Shifu’s escape was so short-lived? Like a carp that had just been slapped back into the water? She could only hope that Shifu would live up to expectations and leap out of the water again; otherwise, both Zhou Feihua and her fate seemed very bleak.</p>
<p>At this moment, Su Yu stood up and quietly asked, “Are you waiting for Su Yishui to emerge from the water? There’s no need to wait any longer. He had just expended too much spirit power and should now be overwhelmed by the dragon’s demonic power. He would be trapped forever inside the dragon’s body.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Ranran turned quickly to look at Su Yu.</p>
<p>How did he know that Shifu had been using the Beast Taming Art inside the dragon’s body? Su Yu couldn’t have known what was happening underwater after Shifu jumped into the lake!</p>
<p>Su Yu smiled and said, “You must be curious about who told me, right?”</p>
<p>As he spoke, he walked to the window and casually flicked the wind chimes he had just given to Zhou Feihua, smiling, “If it weren’t for you and Consort Jing, I really might not have figured out Su Yishui’s plans!”</p>
<p>When Ranran looked closely, she finally saw the intricate patterns on the wrapping paper of the wind chimes… it was a voice transmission talisman!</p>
<p>Ranran couldn’t help but stare at Consort, who couldn’t get up after being bitten, but still had disbelief in her wide eyes as she laid on the ground.</p>
<p>So Su Yu had been listening to everything that had happened in this room through the voice transmission talisman on the wind chimes, yet he remained composed, and even pretended to recognize Ranran through a bowl of porridge.</p>
<p>But why didn’t he stop them from sneaking into the Lake of Enquiry? Why did he allow Ranran to retrieve Su Yishui’s physical body so smoothly?</p>
<p>At this time, the lake’s surface was broken by wave after wave. The giant dragon was tumbling painfully underwater, unable to leap out of the water again due to the chains that restrained it.</p>
<p>Listening to the distant sound of the lake water churning as if listening to soothing music, Su Yu was  relaxed and pleased, “Previously, I indeed harbored thoughts of merging with the dragon. But this dragon is uncontrollable, and its demonic nature is becoming stronger… Seeing the water demon brought in from Wangxiang Pass, I can’t imagine merging with it and becoming half-demon and half-ghost with scales all over. So, after Tianmai Mountain, when I heard that Su Yishui had merged with the white tiger, I had a new idea…”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Ranran’s blood ran cold. She already vaguely guessed Su Yu’s plans. But how did this emperor know about Su Yishui merging with the white tiger, something only Xishan disciples knew? Why would this emperor be aware?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Just then, Old Feng already had his people open the clothing box containing Su Yishui. Su Yu walked to the box and carefully examined Su Yishui’s unconscious form, saying with satisfaction, “Look, he’s older than me, yet he still looks like an eighteen-year-old youth. Youthful permanence, which ordinary people desire, is so easily attainable for him…”</p>
<p>Ranran wanted to rush forward and snatch her master’s body but was restrained by several extraordinary individuals who surrounded her.</p>
<p>She exclaimed, “Are you… trying to *steal his body?”<br/>夺舍 : 借尸还魂</p>
<p><em>Su Yu wants longevity but does not want to become half-demon and half-ghost. Could it be that his true goal is……Shifu’s body?</em></p>
<p>Su Yu laughed heartily, “Steal his body? There needs to be someone in there first! Since he has already vacated his position, how can I be stealing?”</p>
<p>Since Tianmai Mountain, Su Yu had been meticulously planning. When Su Yishui set off for the Capital, all the plans began to unfold.</p>
<p>Including the unusually continuous heavy rain in the Capital recently and the sudden appearance of a dragon shadow in the river, were all intentionally arranged by Su Yu to get Su Yishui’s notice.</p>
<p>He knew Su Yishui too well, a natural genius with astute mind, and also… overly confident.</p>
<p>To protect Mu Qingge, the mother of this dragon egg had been killed by the Jiuyun’s Dragon-Slaying arrow during the Battle of Fanyao, and had given birth to this dragon egg before dying.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge, tearfully promised the mother dragon, to hatch its child and send it back to the Eastern Sea Dragon Island. Unfortunately, Mu Qingge didn’t fulfill her promise and was besieged by the three major sects.</p>
<p>Since Su Yishui had always felt indebted to Mu Qingge, he would definitely fulfill Mu Qingge’s promise and find a way to rescue this dragon trapped in the palace.</p>
<p>Even if Su Yishui did not want to fulfill the promise, he would still absolutely not allow him to merge with the dragon…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Now, everything was proceeding according to his plan. Su Yishui’s soul was trapped inside the dragon, while this youthful and healthy body was unharmed and intact in his hands.</p>
<p>Su Yu’s smile deepened, looking somewhat greedily at the motionless Su Yishui—this healthy body without a soul but with his bloodline, was a heaven-sent opportunity and a reward from heaven!</p>
<p>Ranran gritted her teeth and said, “Are you willing to give up the throne for longevity?” How could Su Yu continue to be emperor with Su Yishui’s face?</p>
<p>Su Yu obviously had already thought about it. He said softly, “When I was young, I looked a lot like Su Yishui. At that time, you often stared at my face dreamily… So if I were to say that I took a cultivator’s refined elixir, which not only cured my ailments but also rejuvenated my youth, it would all be quite natural. I haven’t shown my face in front of the courtiers for a long time. Do you think when they kneel in the court and look at the dragon throne, they will really notice that my appearance has changed?”</p>
<p>His meaning was clear; as long as he claimed to have taken the elixir of immortality and regained his youth, gradually revealing his new appearance a little at a time, people would forget his original face and remember his current appearance.</p>
<p>Just then, Zhou Feihua, who couldn’t move before, finally regained the ability to speak. She stared wide-eyed and said, “Your Majesty! How could you have become like this? Please reconsider! You know he is…… how can you use this evil creature’s body?”</p>
<p>Su Yu looked at his beloved consort with a smile, his tone cold, “Beloved consort, you’ve also changed to the point where I can’t recognize you. You know I need that dragon to extend my life, yet you still want to help others release that dragon. It seems that you’re not as loyal to me as you claim to be……”</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">封印灵泉 Sealing the Spirit Spring </h3>
<p>or <strong>EVERYONE WANTS SU YISHUI</strong></p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Zhou Feihua, upon hearing these words, urgently pleaded, “Your Majesty!”</p>
<p>However, Su Yu no longer wanted to hear her speak.</p>
<p>Lao Feng had already ordered someone to move Su Yishui’s body away. He turned and said, “Your Majesty, please prepare quickly. Now that Su Yishui has just depleted his vital energy and his spiritual force is turbulent, it’s the best time for you to switch positions!”</p>
<p>Su Yu didn’t want to delay either. This worn-out and sickly body was already too burdensome for him. Of course, he hoped to get a healthy body as soon as possible. So he ordered people to keep Ranran and Consort Jing detained in the palace, then he left.</p>
<p>At this moment, Consort Jing’s acupoints were released, but like Ranran, she was also tied up. It seemed that they were left for the Emperor to deal with after he has exchanged a new healthy body.</p>
<p>Although Zhou Feihua’s acupoints were released, her expression was still blank. She was still immersed in the truth that Su Yu had just revealed.</p>
<p>In her impression, the Emperor had always been a warm and generous person.</p>
<p>But in recent years, he had been tortured by illness, making his temperament somewhat strange, and he didn’t like to see people much. However, she never imagined that, in order to regain his health, he was secretly raising an evil dragon and scheming meticulously to exchange bodies with another…</p>
<p>How was this behavior different from becoming demonic?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When Zhou Feihua finally came back to her senses, she found Ranran in a very strange posture beside her, lying on the ground. Although she was tied up and couldn’t move easily, she pressed her ear tightly against the ground.</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua whispered, “What are you doing?”</p>
<p>Ranran looked up at her and said, “If chaos breaks out later, please find a chance to go to Su Yu’s study and find a book for me. This book concerns the safety of the world. Please do me this favor…”</p>
<p>Just as Zhou Feihua was about to speak, there was suddenly another earth-shattering noise from the direction of the Lake of Enquiry not far away. However, this time, it wasn’t the giant dragon leaping out, but a muffled sound like an earthquake.</p>
<p>Ranran’s eyes widened, and just as the sound was about to reach them, she suddenly shouted to Zhou Feihua in a low voice, “Quickly, move aside!”</p>
<p>In the next instant, the entire palace trembled again, and the bluestone floor cracked and surged.</p>
<p>In the moment the floor cracked, Ranran’s toes lightly touched the ground, and inexplicably, her spiritual energy had suddenly recovered, breaking free from the ropes binding her. At the same time, she pulled Zhou Feihua up and together they quickly got out of the collapsing palace.</p>
<p>After placing Zhou Feihua in a safe area, Ranran took out a knife she had taken from a guard earlier, cut the ropes binding Zhou Feihua. She also swiftly subdued several approaching guards.</p>
<p>They then went on separate ways. Zhou Feihua headed towards the imperial study, while Ranran silently recited the wind-riding technique and quickly headed towards Su Yu’s sleeping quarters.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Just now when the floor cracked, she immediately felt her body becoming much lighter, and the empty Dantian that had been empty since entering the palace was filled with spiritual energy again.</p>
<p>It seemed that after Shifu’s attempt to break to the skies with the dragon failed, he proceeded according to their underwater discussion, which was their second plan.</p>
<p>Before her night exploration of the lake, Ranran had circled the entire palace, roughly mapping out the strength of the spiritual energy constraints and kept the wax-sealed map on her body.</p>
<p>Her original plan was to send it out of the palace, to inform Second Uncle Master and the others see if they could dig a tunnel from outside the palace, and destroy the foundation of the palace.</p>
<p>Although this project was somewhat vast, with the use of talismans to drive the straw-men to hit the correct spots, it could be completed in a few nights.</p>
<p>As long as the foundation is destroyed, Second Uncle Master and the others will be able to come in to help.</p>
<p>But after seeing Shifu had possessed the dragon underwater, Ranran changed her plan.</p>
<p>If Shifu couldn’t break to the sky with the yang energy of Duanwu Day, why not try to go underground and completely destroy the Trigram Formation that restricted spiritual energy within the palace?</p>
<p>Now it seemed that this method had indeed worked. After Su Yishui’s failure to rise with the dragon, he tried to escape underground from the soft mud at the bottom of the Lake of Enquiry.</p>
<p>Although using a dragon as a *loach somewhat injured the dignity of the small dragon, at this critical junction, there was no room for too many considerations. Only by breaking the suppression could they escape.<br/><em>*loaches like to dig and burrow</em></p>
<p>However, their original plan did not include handing Shifu’s body over to Su Yu. So after Ranran was freed from the spiritual suppression, she had no time for Zhou Feihua, she could only head quickly in the direction Su Yu had left.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When she arrived at the door of Su Yu’s palace, the guards there didn’t even see her figure clearly, only thought a white light flashed past them, and Ranran had already jumped into the palace. Inside the palace, a ritual altar had already been set up.</p>
<p>Su Yishui and Su Yu were lying in the black and white areas of a Tai Chi Yin Yang fish laid on the ground. Their wrists were entwined with a connected red string.</p>
<p>And Lao Feng was sitting at the array’s center chanting, not stopping even as the surrounding palace around him cracked.</p>
<p>Ranran noticed that there was an oil lamp above the heads of both Shifu and Su Yu. At this moment, the lamp above Su Yishui’s head seemed to be about to go out completely, with the flame flickering weakly.</p>
<p>Ranran took out her mechanism stick, and with a single leap, she pushed Lao Feng off the altar. At the same time, she drew a dagger and cut the red string between the two.</p>
<p>Her actions were quick, but Lao Feng suddenly opened his eyes and burst into laughter, “You’re too late, little girl!”</p>
<p>Just as she cut the red string, the lamp above Su Yishui’s head had gone out completely.</p>
<p>And as the light went out, Su Yishui suddenly opened his eyes.</p>
<p>Ranran anxiously went over to pull him up, “Shifu, how do you feel?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui slowly turned his head to look at her, then turned to look at Su Yu lying beside him, and a smile slowly spread across his lips…</p>
<p>He suddenly reached out and grasped Ranran’s wrist in lightning speed, intending to strike her spiritual acupoint.</p>
<p>Once that acupoint was struck, it would be difficult to call up even surging spiritual power.</p>
<p>Ranran usually practiced sparring with Shifu. Among the three disciples of Xishan, only she had been taught personally by Su Yishui, so when Su Yishui made his move, Ranran naturally raised her hand to block and counter.</p>
<p>But this Shifu left no room for maneuver, his moves were fierce. Ranran knew this was bad and quickly retreated, jumping out of the Yin Yang fish. She felt a chill on her back, looking at this man, handsome as ever, who was smiling at her, “You… are not my Shifu!”</p>
<p>The man slowly stood up, looking at his body and hands with exhilaration, “Although this is not my body, it has retained the original owner’s divine techniques. I am very satisfied…”</p>
<p>As he spoke, he made a gesture and cast a binding spell, swiftly attacking Ranran. Although Su Yu did not learn cultivation, this body he just acquired was a prodigy, and the techniques had become ingrained in its muscle memory.</p>
<p>With Su Yu just thinking it, he could unleash immense power!</p>
<p>Ranran tensed up, her fears had become reality as Su Yu had indeed taken over her master’s body!</p>
<p>Fortunately, her daily sparring with her master had also become ingrained in her muscle memory. She naturally evaded her master’s binding spell and darted aside.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Right then, a dragon’s roar sounded from outside the window. After the palace’s foundations were destroyed, the chains binding the dragon lost their effect, allowing the small dragon to soar into the sky and vanish into the clouds.</p>
<p>It flew extremely fast, disappearing into the sky without a trace, presumably heading back to its homeland, Dragon Island.</p>
<p>Ranran knew that this dragon had been raised cruelly and should not stay in the Capital once unbound.</p>
<p>Shifu must be sending the dragon back to fulfill the promise by Mu Qingge to her deceased friend. However, when he intended to return later, his body had already been taken over, and he might be trapped forever in the dragon’s body!</p>
<p>“You don’t need to be afraid. I won’t hurt you, and I could even treat you better than your master.” Su Yu smiled at Ranran and said, “Ranran, do you know? In your past life, you were actually…”</p>
<p>Before he could finish, his expression suddenly changed, and he reached for his neck.</p>
<p>There seemed to be something burning on his neck, and when Su Yu pulled it off, he realized it was a nearly cracked talisman jade.</p>
<p>This thing was so hot that it couldn’t be held. Su Yu withdrew his hand from holding it, flinging it far away.</p>
<p>Ranran inwardly cried out in alarm, trying to catch it but was too late.</p>
<p>The jade bottle shattered with a loud crack, and a large amount of water spread out. It quickly flowed beneath Su Yu’s feet, and it seemed like countless resentful spirits were floating in the water, emitting eerie laughter, “We’re free! Finally out!”</p>
<p>The spirit spring had been imprisoned for a long time. When Su Yishui’s body changed hands, the power binding the Spring as also relaxed. Combined with the destruction of the palace’s foundation, its power awakened. When Su Yu broke the bottle just now, it was finally released.</p>
<p>The Spirit spring had been waiting for this opportunity for a long time. The large volume of water surged up Su Yishui’s body like demon claws, swiftly enveloping him, trying to completely control him, while emitting strange laughter, “Still the body of the Demon’s Son suits me best… No, why has the soul in this body changed? Well, that’s fine! As long as they’re greedy, I love them all!”</p>
<p>Clearly, the *mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the bird behind.<br/>*螳螂捕蝉黄雀在后<em> idiom</em> : <em>a situation where someone is preoccupied with dealing with an immediate threat or challenge but is unaware of a greater danger lurking behind </em></p>
<p>Su Yu had thought he had everything under control, but he had never expected that the Netherworld Spirit Spring was hanging around Su Yishui’s neck. Now, the Spirit spring was taking over and about to become the new owner of this body!</p>
<p>While the Spirit spring chuckled, it swiftly took control of Su Yishui’s body, and his eyes began to turn bloodshot!</p>
<p>Su Yu felt like his head was about to explode. Unable to bear the pain, he held his head and let out a painful scream. His voice also became increasingly eerie, piercing the eardrums.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>At this very moment, it seemed like all the bad things were happening at once. However, Ranran quickly calmed down, reaching for a golden talisman she was holding.</p>
<p>She didn’t know if this talisman could completely suppress the Spirit Spring possession, but she had to risk it.</p>
<p>If the Spirit spring took control of Su Yu, it would control the entire world, and who knew what kind of atrocities it would commit.</p>
<p>Just then, someone flashed to her side. Ranran looked and was surprised to see Zhou Feihua who had returned!</p>
<p>She looked at Su Yishui with red eyes, her body trembling slightly, “What’s going on? Has the Demon’s Son appeared?”</p>
<p>Obviously, Zhou Feihua had also seen Su Yishui with red eyes before, but what did she mean by “Demon’s Son”?</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t have time to ask further questions. She took out two golden talismans, handing one to Zhou Feihua, “Stick this on his forehead. Otherwise, the Spirit spring will bewitch him, and who knows what he might do!”</p>
<p>Although these two women had not known each other for long, their tacit understanding was exceptionally aligned. After exchanging glances, they split up and attacked Su Yu from both sides.</p>
<p>The Su Yishui possessed by the Spirit spring, now has a surge in spiritual power, making him even harder to handle. Although Zhou Feihua’s swordsmanship was superb, she couldn’t withstand the torrential spiritual power and was quickly thrown back, crashing into a pillar in the hall.</p>
<p>On Ranran’s side, she was also struggling to get close to him but never got the chance.</p>
<p>Just then, he chuckled weirdly and attacked towards Ranran with a wave of his hand.</p>
<p>Actually Ranran could have managed to narrowly avoid it.</p>
<p>Su Yu had completely lost his sanity now, showing no mercy in his attacks, hitting out with soul-shattering strikes.</p>
<p>However, Ranran bit her lip and suddenly made a bold decision. When Su Yu came on with his fierce wave of attacks, Ranran didn’t dodge but instead took the hit on her back. As she coughed out blood, she used the momentum to turn around and stick the golden talisman on his forehead.</p>
<p>There was no other way. She had to endure this blow to get close to him. Ranran had made a split decision, putting her life on the line for this crucial opportunity.</p>
<p>However, this time the golden talisman wasn’t as effective. Although Su Yu paused for a moment, he then shook it off with a burst of force and attacked Ranran again.</p>
<p>But at that moment, a dragon’s roar suddenly erupted in the sky. The palace’s roof was violently smashed. The small dragon had returned, roaring, sweeping towards Su Yu, carrying him into the air, then left again with another roar.</p>
<p>Enduring the intense pain, Ranran took a deep breath, and whistled towards the sky, summoning Vermilion bird. As *Zhu que spread its huge wings and regained its full form, she also jumped onto its back and hurriedly chased after the direction where the dragon had gone.<br/><em>Vermilion : Zhu   bird : que </em></p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But just now, she was struck by unrestrained spirit power, even though Ranran had been wearing soft silver armor, it couldn’t stop it. Now, the soft silver armor inside her clothes shattered completely, and her body felt cold.</p>
<p>Ranran knew that this was the manifestation of a severe internal injury caused by spirit power. The vitality field in her Dantian was like a leaking water tank, rapidly disappearing.</p>
<p>She didn’t know how long she could hold on.</p>
<p>The dragon flew very fast, but the Vermilion Bird who have regained its physical form also flew like an arrow, quickly reaching the dragon’s side.</p>
<p>Su Yu who was possessed by the Spirit Spring, had been wrestling non-stop with the dragon, and they finally fell together. Although they have not reached the East Sea, they were now on the sea surface near the coast.</p>
<p>As they fell, Ranran also dived down with the Vermilion Bird.</p>
<p>As Ranran lay on the Vermilion Bird’s head, she whispered in excruciating pain, “Little Zhu Zhu, help me, your blood can purify demonic creatures, can you… let me have some?”</p>
<p>The Vermilion Bird maneuvered in the sky, loudly screeching. Ranran tentatively bit its back with her mouth and the Vermilion Bird didn’t seem to react, which Ranran took as its tacit consent.</p>
<p>So she bit hard, causing the Vermilion Bird to cry out in pain, but it didn’t shake Ranran off its back.</p>
<p>While Ranran took a mouthful of the Vermilion Bird’s spiritual blood, it flew to the side of the small dragon. Ranran took the opportunity to jump down. She caught Su Yu, who was entangled with the dragon, grabbed his neck, tilted his head, and poured the Vermilion Bird’s spiritual blood from her mouth into his.</p>
<p>The Vermilion Bird itself was a holy creature that repelled evil. Even the Immortal-Devouring Bugs from the Demonic Realm didn’t dare approach it.</p>
<p>Now that the Vermilion Bird’s spiritual blood had been fed to Su Yu, Ranran fell off, completely spent. If not for the dragon’s claw catching her in time, she would have almost fallen into the sea.</p>
<p>Su Yu urgently tried to vomit out the Vermilion Bird’s spiritual blood, but it was too late. The Spirit Spring couldn’t bear it, emitting a piercing scream, then it oozed out of his pores and eyes like sweat mixed with blood, got swallowed into the mouth of the small dragon…</p>
<p>Ranran wanted to hold on, but her internal injuries were too severe, and she couldn’t hold on any longer. Her vision darkened, and she fell unconscious.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When she woke up again, she found herself lying in a damp cave, with a pile of dry grass underneath…</p>
<p>Ranran’s chest still hurt greatly. She looked around with the light from the nearby campfire, and saw the man meditating by the fire with disheveled long hair and bare arms…</p>
<p>Looking at Su Yishui’s profile, Ranran felt a start as she remembered that her master’s body had been taken over by Su Yu!</p>
<p>She began to feel around her body, trying to find if she still had any gold talisman. But as she felt around, she realized that she was wearing… her Shifu’s undershirt!</p>
<p>She picked the fabric to make this undershirt at a tailor’s down the mountain, so she could recognize it at a glance. Looking over, she saw her own clothes propped up with sticks, drying by the fire…</p>
<p>“You dog emperor! Who allowed you to take off my clothes!” Ranran tried to get up but found that her back was fastened to a board, making it difficult for her to move.</p>
<p>At this moment, the man who was meditating slowly opened his eyes. Ranran noticed a faint redness in his eyes and her heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p><em>Oh no! The Spirit Spring hasn’t dispersed yet?</em></p>
<p>The man walked over, held Ranran down when she was about to move, and said coldly, “Move again, and your bones will be broken into pieces! You’ll probably be bedridden for life.”</p>
<p>This man’s stern expression didn’t resemble Su Yu’s smiling face at all; instead, he looked more like her Shifu with his cold demeanor.</p>
<p>Ranran remained still, but tears welled up in her eyes. “Su Yu, if you want longevity, I can give you my body. Please return my Shifu’s body back to him!”</p>
<p>Hearing this, the man chuckled coldly at the words, “How would you give it?”</p>
<p>Ranran actually didn’t hold much hope, since Su Yu was unlikely to want to become a woman. Her body probably held no allure for him…</p>
<p>But at that moment, the man leaned down, his long hair falling on the side of her face, his eyes with a faint blood-red hue fixed firmly on her as he said: “Are you even aware of the consequences of saying things like offering your body to a man harboring evil designs on you?”</p>
<p>Ranran felt that the despicable emperor had rebuked her when she hadn’t even scolded him for coveting her master’s body yet!</p>
<p>However… from the way he glared at her…she couldn’t help but feel that he looked more like her Shifu?</p>
<p>Right now, the man seemed to be trying hard to suppress the anger in his heart and the redness in his eyes. So he picked up the grilled fish from the fire and said, “You were clamoring for fresh sea fish some days ago, right? Today, your wish is granted, but unfortunately, there are no sour fruits to go with the fish. You’ll have to make do.”</p>
<p>Ranran held her breath as she listened… the words about craving sea fish were something she had told her third senior sister before arriving in the Capital. Her Shifu was beside them at the time and naturally heard it.</p>
<p>That despicable emperor wouldn’t possibly know about what she said… Does this mean her Shifu has returned?</p>
<p>She grabbed his arm and warily asked, “What did we do at the waterfall in the Western Mountain?</p>
<p>He lowered his head again, “Which are you asking about? Drinking wine? Listening to the zither, or you saving me by giving me mouth-to-mouth?”</p>
<p>Alright… he described it perfectly, but why are his words and expression so frivolous? He didn’t look one bit like her composed Shifu..</p>
<p>As he asked that question, his face got closer and closer to Ranran’s, as if he was about to give mouth-to-mouth to save his little disciple who didn’t know how to breathe…</p>
<p>Ranran was fixed to the board and couldn’t move even if she wanted to. Seeing him getting closer, she could only cry loudly, “Shifu! You scared me to death! You’re still teasing people like this! Did you know… I thought you could never come back!”</p>
<p>Saying this, Ranran’s eyes reddened with tears.</p>
<p>But Su Yishui didn’t think he did anything inappropriate. He raised an eyebrow and said coldly, “So I can’t even get a little closer? But you can voluntarily kiss Su Yu?”</p>
<p>“What kiss? I clearly did it to force out the Spirit Spring, by force feeding… him the Vermilion Bird’s blood… No, wait, but that mouth is also your mouth. How can you say I voluntarily kissed Su Yu?”</p>
<p>Under the gaze of Shifu’s handsome yet enigmatic eyes, Ranran almost couldn’t speak just now. It was only at the last moment that she remembered she had no other choice.</p>
<p><em>That was to expel the demonic influence! And she kissed her Shifu’s mouth…</em></p>
<p>Hmm, thinking back now, Ranran realized that she should have felt a little embarrassed about it and should have sincerely apologized to her Shifu. After all, she had been rather frivolous with Shifu.</p>
<p>But Su Yishui lowered his head and stopped the rest of what she intended to say with a kiss.</p>
<p>This kiss carried a tinge of urgency, as if confirming that a fragile treasure had returned to his embrace.</p>
<p>Ranran couldn’t move due to her injuries, so she could only let her Shifu kiss her almost to the point of suffocating…</p>
<p>When their lips finally parted, Ranran looked into his eyes, and it seemed that the redness had dissipated somewhat.</p>
<p>“Shifu… you’re not keeping your word…”</p>
<p>Shifu clearly said that they should both adhere to their master-disciple relationship in future, and neither should cross the line! So why is he kissing her to no end now?</p>
<p>Well, even though she had been “frivolous” with Shifu first, she had a legitimate reason. But what was Shifu’s reason for this behavior?</p>
<p>It turns out that Su Yishui did have a legitimate reason.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>At that time, the mouthful of Vermilion Bird’s blood that Ranran fed him was quite effective; it immediately suppressed the demonic nature of Spirit Spring.</p>
<p>As Su Yu’s soul had just attached itself, and he had previously survived by absorbing the dragon’s vitality, he naturally carried some demonic nature.</p>
<p>His possession had just completed, and his foundation wasn’t stable yet. The Vermilion Bird’s blood first considered Su Yu’s soul as a demonic entity and expelled it. Then the Spirit Spring was absorbed into the dragon’s mouth, merging with Su Yishui’s soul.</p>
<p>Su Yishui used the power of the Spirit Spring, took this opportunity to transfer from the dragon’s body back into his own body.</p>
<p>However, Su Yishui couldn’t force the Spirit Spring out of his body yet. Because the talisman jade bottle was destroyed, if he forced out the Spirit Spring, it would attach to someone else randomly, leading to another bloody and chaotic situation.</p>
<p>Su Yishui could only use his own body as a temporary container to seal the Spirit Spring for now.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>As much as I enjoy this story, I still question why Su Yu was able to use Su Yishui’s abilities. </p>
<p>I get that the physical body is the same, so I suppose the spiritual energy stored within is the same. <br/>So Su Yu took over the ‘hardware’ of Su Yishui, able to use the system which has all the specs.</p>
<p>But a human body is not just a device? If the brain is the same so it retained the same knowledge about spells and techniques? What about other stored memories? Clearly that was not with the ‘bundle offer’ here.</p>
<p>I can accept ‘muscle memory’ for physical fighting. <br/>That is the objective of repetitive training. So that one can take action without thought, to survive in that decisive split second.<br/>The writer seems to explain this as an attribute that is special only to Su Yishui because he is a prodigy. <em>lol </em>So for him, spells and techniques are hard-coded in his body and also retained with the soul?</p>
<p>Now a deeper question.</p>
<p>What then is the soul? <br/>What defines a person? The essence, personality, memories?</p>
<p>Su yu still retained his own set of ‘Su yu’ defining personality and memories when he took over. <br/>Su Yishui while he possesses the dragon, obviously still retained everything he knows. He didn’t forget how to use his spells. </p>
<p>Xue Ranran, she was Mu Qingge, but without memories of her past life.<br/>She still had the same kind of values on how she looks at life.<br/>She still handled matters the same way she would have in her past life. <br/>The difference was she started over with an ‘unfinished’ body since she was only on the tree for three short years, but the essence of who she was, seems intact. I suppose if she had stayed on the tree for the full 20 years, maybe she could have reincarnated with all her memories intact like Mu Ranwu has, instead of the broken fragments she has now. Maybe its like her memory drive was corrupted before she finished restoring <em>lol</em></p>
<p>So now, does that make her the same person?<br/><br/></p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>
<p>When I first read this chapter, I was wondering how did Su Yishui see Ranran taking the hit since he was supposed to be with the dragon at the time.</p>
<p>I suppose when the dragon broke free and flew away, Su Yishui might have needed to fight its impulse to escape. He only just managed to bring it back under his control, to return to the palace because he could never leave Ranran there by herself. </p>
<p>So that was how he came back just in time to see her being struck by Su Yu and became violent with rage.</p>
<p>SIDE NOTE <br/><em>There is so much CG divine creatures in this drama, I really hope they can execute it well.</em></p>

<p>However, in doing so, his temperament inevitably fell under the influence of the Spirit Spring. It was like being in the same cage as a fierce tiger, always vigilant, either coexisting with the tiger or being devoured by it.</p>
<p>The depth of redness in his eyes was an indication of the strength of the demonic nature. When Su Yishui kissed her just now, his eyes were red, showing that the demonic nature had become stronger and somewhat uncontrollable.</p>
<p>When Ranran learned about all this, she could no longer blame her Shifu’s capriciousness. Not only was the Spirit Spring extremely evil, but it was also quite a lecher, causing her Shifu to always lose control and do things he couldn’t restrain from!</p>
<p>Their bond between Shifu and her, as master and disciple was unassailable, how could it break apart because of a wicked little Spirit Spring?</p>
<p>Alright, when Shifu kissed her so fiercely just now, Ranran was actually quite shaken inside, feeling that the bond between master and disciple was like water flowing away, and it would be difficult to return to its original state…</p>
<p>But Su Yishui knew clearly in his heart, that his loss of control just now was because he saw this darn girl deliberately risk her life to take a blow to paste the gold talisman.</p>
<p>Now whenever he recalled that scene, he couldn’t control the impulse inside him to destroy the entire world… Thinking of this, his eyes began to turn red again, and at the same time, his hand uncontrollably reached out to grab her chin. But he used too much force, causing Ranran to move, which in turn pulled on her back, making her big eyes surge with wells of tears: “Shifu, it hurts…”</p>
<p>With this cry, the redness in Su Yishui’s eyes finally dissipated, and he carefully placed her back down, while quickly using his spiritual energy to help alleviate her pain.</p>
<p>Earlier, Su Yu had showed no mercy with that palm when the Spirit Spring went out of control. If it were someone else, they would probably have died on the spot. Fortunately, Ranran had soaked in the Marrow-cleansing pool before, which had increased her spiritual power to quite an extent. Moreover, after that, she had taken a mouthful of Vermilion Bird’s blood, which barely maintained her soul from dispersing, enduring until Su Yishui’s soul returned to his body and he promptly treated her.</p>
<p>But her spine had been shattered, requiring a blend of spiritual energy and quiet recovery. Her daily life and meals depended entirely on Su Yishui’s care.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran didn’t have much confidence in her Shifu who has become demonic. The Spirit Spring’s demonic nature was very strong, enough to change a person’s temperament. And her Shifu using his body as a talisman bottle was already a major variable.</p>
<p>However, she discovered that her master had some know-how; it seemed like he had long learned how to coexist with the Spirit Spring. Although his personality had become somewhat gloomy and irritable, whether it was roasting fish for her or letting her drink water, he took care of her very meticulously.</p>
<p>In a short time, Ranran also figured out how to handle him; no matter how red Shifu’s eyes got, just quickly pretend to cry and be in pain. Every time she did this, the redness in his eyes would diminish quite a bit.</p>
<p>As for their current location, it was a deserted island in the sea. They had fought fiercely before, and ended up falling onto this small island.</p>
<p>Ranran had threw up blood due to her internal injuries, so her clothes got dirty which was why Shifu had taken them off and washed them in the sea before drying them by fire. Ranran tried her best not to think about the details of how he changed her clothes. Luckily, it was only the outer clothes that were dirty…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After Su Yu’s soul was forced out, it disappeared without a trace. According to Su Yishui, if that old Feng from the palace had some skills, he should be able to use Su Yu’s body to summon his soul and guide it back.</p>
<p>This time, Ranran saw the vast depth of scheming that “little Yu” was capable of. He was about to succeed, but was one step short when he failed to account for the Spirit Spring which caused everything to fall apart.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, this Emperor probably wouldn’t give up easily. Ranran was very worried about Zhou Feihua, who was still in the palace.</p>
<p>As for the little dragon, it was swimming around in the sea around the small island. Su Yishui had used a Qiankun ring made by Zeng Yi to clamp around its neck.</p>
<p>So when it wanted to swallow something, it had to come to Su Yishui to loosen the ring before it could swallow successfully, so it didn’t stray too far.</p>
<p>However, it had been imprisoned in a small water pond since childhood, and now suddenly coming to the vast and endless sea, its excitement was enough to offset the discomfort of being bound at its neck.</p>
<p>Since Ranran woke up, the waves around the small island seemed to never stop. The little dragon kept chasing schools of fish, splashing its tail on the shore, hardly ever having a quiet moment, behaving like a playful child let loose.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The next day, with Su Yishui’s channeling of spiritual energy, Ranran’s injuries had healed by about thirty percent. At the very least, she could remove the board and sit up.</p>
<p>So during the day, while Shifu meditated in the cave on the island, guarding against the malevolent nature of the Spirit Spring, she liked to sit on a reef, inhaling the damp sea breeze.</p>
<p>These days of digging mussels with a dagger on the reef for cooking and watching the little dragon chase fish would have been more enjoyable than study travels if she was not injured.</p>
<p>Initially, the little dragon would sneak closer to Ranran, then slowly revealing its head, looking like it was up to no good.</p>
<p>Having tasted human flesh before, it couldn’t help but desire this delicious little girl full of spiritual power, and long for a main course. But after a few ambushes where it nearly lost an eye to Ranran’s dagger, it finally learnt to behave.</p>
<p>And there was one time, this fierce little girl threw some kind of mud pill into its mouth. It then lost its appetite and actually felt nauseous for half a day after eating a fish.</p>
<p>After that incident, it didn’t eat for several days and later on, was no longer very interested in eating her.</p>
<p>What Ranran fed it, was of course the Heart-Calming Pill she refined. This pill’s effects were so potent that even a dragon could abstain from food.</p>
<p>As Su Yishui had said, this dragon had fallen into the hands of someone with ulterior motives who only pushed its spiritual power to maturity without teaching it right from wrong.</p>
<p>Now, as Shifu was planning to take it back to Dragon Island to fulfill an old promise, it was necessary to first suppress its malevolence; otherwise, it might continue attacking passing ships, becoming a monster that hunted people.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But compared to the little dragon, Shifu’s problem was more challenging and couldn’t be solved with a few pills.</p>
<p>Although most of the time, Shifu could restrain the Spirit Spring’s malevolence with his strong willpower, during the late hours of the night, when the Spirit Spring’s malevolence was at its peak, he occasionally couldn’t control it…</p>
<p>Ranran was still young with limited knowledge. She couldn’t understand the Spirit Spring’s *Zhu Bajie-like attribute. Why did Shifu always have to kiss someone when he had an attack?<br/>*猪八戒 <em>is from Journey to the West, this disciple was very lecherous and likes women</em></p>
<p>And why did he always leave her breathless?<br/></p>
<p>On the third night on the small island, the sea breeze was chilly late at night. Su Yishui wrapped Ranran tightly in his clothes, he stroked her face which was still flushed, and asked, “Why, are you still cold?”</p>
<p>Ranran had been very sleepy lately, as sleeping was the best way to repair her body after the spiritual injuries. However, it was difficult to sleep when feeling cold.</p>
<p>Because of her internal injuries, Ranran couldn’t mobilize her spiritual energy to keep warm, so even with a bonfire late at night, she still felt chilly.</p>
<p>Su Yishui would quietly activate his spiritual energy, to hold her and keep her warm. But as he held her and looked at the fragrant and tender girl in his arms, he couldn’t help but want to kiss her.</p>
<p>Just a moment ago, he couldn’t resist again and held her red lips in his, kissing passionately.</p>
<p>The girl, who had been pale from the cold moments ago, blushed like she had a fever after Su Yishui pressed her with his warmth.</p>
<p>In the beginning, she felt shy and embarrassed being held like this by Shifu. But habits were really scary. It was only the third night, yet she was already accustomed to his warm and comfortable embrace.</p>
<p>When Shifu had asked if she was still cold, she shook her head. Her vitality would automatically circulate at night, beginning to heal her injuries.</p>
<p>She was so sleepy that she closed her eyes lazily, letting her thoughts be enveloped in cotton, snuggled her face deeper and deeper into Shifu’s arms, and then fell asleep peacefully, repairing her broken body.</p>
<p>If she opened her eyes at this moment, she would have seen Shifu’s eyes turn even redder, as if dripping blood…</p>
<p>Su Yishui slowly closed his eyes, tried his hardest to take deep breaths, and suppressed the violent urges within him.</p>
<p>Once the Spirit Spring got a foothold, it would endlessly amplify one’s desires. Su Yishui knew what his obsession was. And right now, what he had longed for in two lifetimes was in his arms, sleeping so peacefully.</p>
<p>But he had to struggle to restrain himself. These three nights on the island, he hadn’t closed his eyes at all, fearing that one slip would harm this little fruit that he had painstakingly begged for from the heavens.</p>
<p>Now, late into the night on the island, only the roaring of the waves could be heard. Su Yishui could not go to sleep, watching the girl in his arms sleep deeply. In the quiet cave, there seemed to be an almost inaudible sigh: “Qingge…”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>These past days, the Vermilion bird had passed a cloth strip from Su Yishui to Yutong and the others, informing them of the chaos in the palace.</p>
<p>Although the incident with the dragon flying around was very brief, the commotion it had made under the ground was immense, shaking the entire Capital.</p>
<p>The day the little dragon ascended and the Vermilion bird spread its wings, such an extraordinary event had astounded the people of the city.</p>
<p>Combined with the fact that it was the Dragon Boat Festival that day. There were rumors of pouring realgar wine into the palace lake, stirring the guardian dragon of the palace, and the dragon had shown its divine powers and even flew together with phoenixes.</p>
<p>But beyond these ignorant claims, there were also rumors of the palace secretly raising a dragon, with the Emperor seeking longevity at the cost of nurturing a demonic creature that fed on people, leading to divine wrath that punished the Emperor, destroyed the palace, and even shortened his lifespan.</p>
<p>The Emperor probably couldn’t hold on much longer and was nearing death!</p>
<p>Those who knew a bit about the situation knew that this second rumor was the truth.</p>
<p>When the little dragon went wild underground, much of the palace was destroyed, and since then, the Emperor had fallen into a coma. Later, it was said that he woke up but remained hidden from view.</p>
<p>However, orders had been issued to suppress any rumors about the dragons in the city, only allowing talk of auspicious signs blessing the Great Qi.</p>
<p>But the people in the Capital were anxious, and the concubines who had sons were all harboring thoughts. Everyone tried their best to secretly take action.</p>
<p>After all, Su Yu had never formally appointed a crown prince. If anything happened to him, the forces behind these sons would surely vie for power, leading to a struggle for the throne.</p>
<p>In a note from the Second Uncle Master, she mentioned a few critical matters. The first was that Mu Qingge took advantage of the chaos in the capital and while they were rushing to the palace, secretly removed the immobilizing talisman and fled.</p>
<p>The second matter concerns the follow-up of the Zhou father and daughter. The entire Zhou family has been arrested, reportedly due to some witchcraft by Consort Jing in the palace, cursing the emperor, which led to the Zhou family’s downfall. It’s said that the father and daughter are now being imprisoned, but the specific situation is unclear.</p>
<p>Ranran is very worried about Zhou Feihua. After all the planning by Su Yu, ending up in failure, he will surely vent his anger on her father and her.</p>
<p>Thinking back to when Zhou Feihua could have turned Ranran in or not helped her sneak into the Lake of Enquiry, perhaps things wouldn’t have ended up like this. Ranran couldn’t help but feel guilty, thinking that she must rescue the Zhou father and daughter.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Three days ago, she couldn’t move due to her serious injuries, but now that she can, she wants to go back as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Su Yishui sat by the sea rocks with his hair loose, and said to her, “The Zhou father and daughter will be fine. I will find a way to save them.”</p>
<p>But Ranran firmly shook her head. “No, Shifu, you just escaped danger. If you fall into Su Yu’s trap again, what should we do? I owe her a debt, I will repay it myself!”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Shifu’s eyes turned red again, and he smirked devilishly, “Are you saying I can’t handle Su Yu?”</p>
<p>Ranran realized that now that Su Yishui was possessed by the Spirit Spring, he was like a touchy donkey, easily provoked to his demonic side. She carefully used her fingers as a comb, brushing his hair gently, and said, “How can he compare to you? That old man is very bad!”</p>
<p>Su Yishui was quite satisfied with “little Yu” turning into an bad old man. The slight redness in his eyes faded a bit as he pulled Ranran before him and began to tidy her hair.</p>
<p>“Shifu, when are we going back? My body is fine now,” Ranran asked.</p>
<p>Su Yishui pinched her cheek and replied, “We’ll go back in two days. The medicine you carried with you has run out, and if we delay any longer, you won’t have any energy.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Ranran pursed her lips. It was Su Yu’s words that made her come to realize that the water she had been drinking might indeed have been soaked tree roots.</p>
<p>But those roots, were probably roots from the Rebirth Tree. Could she really be a fruit grown on that tree? Was she Mu Qingge’s sister… Mu Ranwu?</p>
<p>Su Yishui seemed to sense her thoughts and mildly said, “While I was in the lake, I overheard your conversation with Su Yu. As you have said, the matters of your past life have nothing to do with you now. You are just Xue Ranran, carefree with no obligations. As for your past owed favors, I’ll take care of them for you.”</p>
<p>As he said this, his eyes become less red, like clear autumn waters. Ranran lifted her head to look up at him, feeling a sudden gush of warmth in her heart.</p>
<p>So what if everyone said Shifu was the “Demon’s Son”? Even if he was possessed by the evil Spirit Spring, he was still the Shifu who dotes on her!</p>
<p>So when Su Yishui lowered his head to kiss her again, she couldn’t help but wrap her arms around his neck and deepened the kiss naturally.</p>
<p>She didn’t know what was in her heart, but looking at Su Yishui’s beautiful eyes filled with her reflection, she felt a strange sweetness.</p>
<p>And when he kissed her, her heart also raced and her ears filled with the rush of blood…</p>
<p>She didn’t even have time to think about what would happen to their relationship after Shifu returned the Spirit Spring to the Netherworld and was no longer driven by demonic influences.</p>
<p>At least on this island, there were no external disturbances, only sweet embraces. The sea breeze gently blew, the waves lapped the shore, and when the little dragon in the water caught a fish and flicked its tail, it created a brilliant rainbow in the sky…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But compared to the sweetness on the island, the atmosphere in the Great Qi Imperial Palace was dark and gloomy.</p>
<p>Su Yu withdrew from his body but was driven away by the blood of the Vermilion bird, which greatly damaged his primordial spirit. When Lao Feng discovered that Su Yu’s primordial spirit lamp was about to extinguish, he knew things were not good. He used the Summoning Spirit to guide Su Yu’s primordial spirit back to his body.</p>
<p>Although Su Yu managed to return to his body, he immediately vomited a large mouthful of blood upon waking up, a sign of his primordial spirit’s exhaustion.</p>
<p>Lao Feng knew that Su Yu is near his end. Su Yu himself knew that his mind was clear, but he was being held back by his body.</p>
<p>Now the border was in crisis. If he collapsed again, none of his sons would be able to handle the situation. With a heart full of ambition and strategy, but he would have to leave with regrets.</p>
<p><em>How could he be willing!</em></p>
<p>But at that moment, Wei Jiu from the Crimson Gate actually visited the Yiren Hall in person, demanding to see the emperor.</p>
<p>Previously, Su Yu had sent someone to ask Wei Jiu for the antidote for that imposter, but the eunuch was scolded by Wei Jiu and returned empty-handed.</p>
<p>Su Yu knew that this devil probably had ulterior motives, but he also wanted to see Wei Jiu.</p>
<p>So Wei Jiu was led by the palace servants and arrived at the imperial palace, passing through the ruins of the palace walls.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu’s eyes were sharp, and he immediately noticed that Su Yu’s primordial spirit had left his body before. Combined with the intelligence from the spies in the Capital, he couldn’t help but smile.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, I underestimated you before. You actually managed to outwit even Su Yishui, that old fox. With such strategies, it’s no wonder Mu Qingge valued you so much.”</p>
<p>Su Yu, pale and weak, but still smiled faintly, “If Your Excellency Wei has come all this way just to laugh at me?”</p>
<p>After saying this, Su Yu started to cough violently, each cough accompanied by a hint of blood.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu sat on the chair brought by the eunuch, smiling darkly as he looked at Su Yu who was nearing the end, “Your Majesty, if you’re willing to answer a question that has been bothering me, I might have a way to extend your life.”</p>
<p>Su Yu slowly turned to look at him, “What do you want to ask…?”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu pulled the chair closer, but a eunuch immediately tried to stop him.</p>
<p>But Su Yu waved off the attendants. He, a dying man; was he afraid of being assassinated right now?</p>
<p>So Wei Jiu leaned in close to Su Yu’s ear and asked, “That Mu Qingge in your palace… is she actually real?”</p>
<p>A smile gradually appeared on Su Yu’s bloodless face, “What do you think?”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu pondered Su Yu’s subtle expression and seemed to catch a hint. He slowly said, “I feel… she doesn’t seem real. There were two fruits on the Rebirth Tree back then, but one grew poorly and fell early. I never found any trace of it… It’s quite suspicious now that I think about it.”</p>
<p>Su Yu smiled and said, “If you want to know the whereabouts of the other spiritual fruit, why not first tell me how to prolong my life? After all, I could breathe my last at any moment, and I believe Your Excellency wouldn’t want that. Shall I take this secret to the grave?”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu laughed and raised an eyebrow, “Since Your Majesty intends to deal with Su Yishui, then consider me, Wei Jiu, your friend. Please rest assured, I won’t let such a capable friend as you meet an untimely end…”</p>
<p>Su Yu’s smile deepened, “It’s been a long time since I’ve had anyone as a friend. I’m quite pleased. Since we are friends, after Wei Your Excellency extends my life, perhaps we can discuss the matter of the Spirit Spring in detail…”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu’s eyes flickered slightly. He came here wanting to know the true fate of Mu Qingge, but he never expected to gain such an unexpected reward as the Spirit Spring!</p>
<p>He sincerely took Su Yu’s emaciated hand and said, “Your Majesty, with me here, the King of Hell won’t be able to take you away just yet…”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Leaving aside the sincere friendship that had just blossomed in the imperial palace, we return to the the small island where there was only two people. Xue Ranran finally retrieved the foot she had crossed into the gates of death.</p>
<p>The power of the marrow-cleansing pool, actually stimulated deeper potential within Ranran after she had suffered serious injuries. Due to her congenital deficiencies, her spiritual veins had been thinner than those of ordinary cultivators, but after this severe injury, Su Yishui seemed to have rebuilt her spiritual veins in the aftermath, allowing her to better unleash her spiritual power.</p>
<p>In a way, it could be considered turning adversity into blessings.</p>
<p>When Ranran could circulate her spiritual energy and jump around, she felt that her spiritual energy was flowing more smoothly than before.</p>
<p>However, it was precisely because of the improvement in her spiritual power that she could sense Shifu’s spiritual power running rich and unrestrained, but that he was constantly suppressing the rapidly surging spiritual power induced by the Spirit Spring.</p>
<p>It was like someone constantly restraining a fierce tiger in their heart, never able to relax, or else the wild beast would burst out of its cage and be hard to contain again.</p>
<p>This constant and exhausting toil made Ranran feel heartache.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Next, they set off for Dragon Island, where they would send back this little dragon.</p>
<p>Dragon Island was deep in the East Sea, surrounded by the Dragon Clan’s barrier, even Su Yishui couldn’t pass through easily.</p>
<p>But the little dragon had no such restrictions. When they reached the edge of Dragon Island, Ranran earnestly instructed the little dragon, “After you go over, get along well with your companions, learn how to be a dragon properly, and don’t casually come out again, lest you fall into the hands of bad people.”</p>
<p>The little dragon seemed very impatient with Ranran’s mawkish instructions, constantly shaking its head and swinging its tail.</p>
<p>But as Ranran and Su Yishui were about to leave, the little dragon poked its head out of the water again, looking somewhat pitifully at Ranran.</p>
<p>Ranran smiled and said to it, “I’ll come to see you again when I have time in future. Eat more fish and grow even more majestic!”</p>
<p>The little dragon heard this, shook its head with its own majestic little dragon horn, and let out another dragon roar.</p>
<p>From afar, on the misty Dragon Island, there was an echo of dragon roars, as if urging the little dragon, who had been away from home for too long, to return quickly.</p>
<p>So, after waving goodbye to the little dragon, Ranran and Shifu returned quickly on Zhuque’s back.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>This time, they didn’t go straight back to the Capital but met with Yutong on a nearby mountain.</p>
<p>When Ranran dismounted from the back of the Vermilion bird, she saw someone unexpected and was pleasantly surprised—Zhou Feihua was sitting by the fire with Yu Chen and Yutong.</p>
<p>Ranran exclaimed joyously, “Consort Jing, how did you escape from the palace?”</p>
<p>The present Zhou Feihua was no longer the Consort adorned in luxurious silks and Phoenix hairpins. She dressed in sharp men’s clothing, with her hair styled like a man’s, resembling a male armed escort in the Jianghu.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>
<p>The poor Spirit Spring had to take the rap for Su Yishui and become a lecherous spring <em>lol</em></p>
<p>So the interesting thing is, the Spirit Spring magnifies the desires of people. So Su Yishui loses control and he kisses Ranran. But the effect of kissing her, actually makes him stronger and able to suppress the spring, instead of becoming more under the control because he was indulging himself. I suppose he was making even more effort when he reminds himself what he cannot afford to lose?</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">毒舌师父   THE MEAN SHIFU</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>When Su Yu wanted to punish the father and daughter of the Zhou family, the border erupted in war. The capable generals in the court were all old subordinates of Zhou Dao.</p>
<p>Upon hearing of Zhou Dao’s arrest, his old subordinates collectively petitioned His Majesty, pleading for leniency towards General Zhou.</p>
<p>Although Su Yu was obsessed with achieving immortality, when it came to matters concerning his ancestors and the country, he never acted foolishly. At this critical juncture, he naturally couldn’t do anything that will destroy the morale of the generals.</p>
<p>However, he had long been wary of Zhou Dao. Taking advantage of this opportunity, he removed Zhou Dao from his official position and allowed him to retire back to his hometown.</p>
<p>As for Zhou Feihua, being a palace concubine, she naturally had to be dealt with according to palace rules. While her life was spared, she couldn’t escape punishment and was sent to the Cold palace.</p>
<p>Yutong, after receiving a reply sent from her Master by the Vermilion bird, she proceeded with his instructions. With her brother, they sneaked into the Cold palace at night, putting an unclaimed female corpse dug from an unmarked grave in her place and setting fire to Zhou Feihua’s residence.</p>
<p>After the people in the palace put out the fire, they would find a charred body, and from then on, Consort Jing would cease to exist.</p>
<p>Ranran only just learned about Shifu’s private arrangements, now she couldn’t help but look at Zhou Feihua.</p>
<p>Even though Su Yu was hateful, Ranran felt that Zhou Feihua was not as carefree as she appeared. She should have had feelings for Su Yu beyond their monarch-subject relationship.</p>
<p>Otherwise, sacrificing so much just to supervise the Emperor closely as a concubine would be too much! Perhaps Zhou Feihua entered the palace because she liked Su Yu, knowing full well that he had feelings for other women. She was willing to put on red clothes and dance with swords all night for him…</p>
<p>Now that Zhou Feihua had escaped from there, would she resent Shifu since she won’t be able to see Su Yu again?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When Zhou Feihua and Ranran were taking a walk together, Ranran asked if she missed the palace. Zhou Feihua sighed and said, “He has changed. He’s no longer the young emperor I once knew. He could even manipulate the person he likes, Mu Qingge. What am I compared to that? My father had hoped that I can leave the palace, and I was already tired of that life. Being able to fake my death and leave the palace is already a blessing from heaven…”</p>
<p>At this point, she turned to ask Ranran, “Who are you exactly? Su Yu said you are also a fruit from the Rebirth Tree? Could it be… you are Mu Ranwu who caused the death of Mu Qingge?”</p>
<p>Saying this, Zhou Feihua looked at Ranran with a sharp gaze.</p>
<p>Ranran understood the straightforward nature of this Consort and couldn’t help but scratch her two buns in frustration. “Since I’ve already died once, I naturally don’t remember anything from my past life. If Your Ladyship is willing to let bygones be bygones, then I’ll be grateful for it. Otherwise, wouldn’t it have been for nothing, hanging on that tree for so many years? I am just Xue Ran Ran now, nobody else!”</p>
<p>Seeing Ranran’s pained look, Zhou Feihua couldn’t bring herself to utter any malicious curses she intended to say. The young girl really didn’t remember anything, and it would be really unfair to scold her for things she couldn’t recall.</p>
<p>Moreover, she really liked this straightforward young girl. Perhaps the Rebirth Tree was even more powerful than *Granny Meng’s Soup. The sister who silently followed Mu Qingge in her previous life, the girl who often used underhanded methods, was now so brave and refreshing.<br/>*孟婆汤<em> is a legend where people drink a soup to forget their past lives to move to another cycle</em></p>
<p>Of course, Zhou Feihua didn’t think Su Yishui was the one who had taught her so well to produce such an excellent female disciple.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>In the evening, while grilling by the fire, she saw how affectionate Su Yishui and Ranran were with each other. They were sharing a roasted chicken leg so naturally, it was obvious that their relationship not as simple as master and disciple.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge sacrificed so much for him back then, yet he still lived comfortably, even taking in a beautiful and young female disciple, taking advantage of her.<br/>*吃着鲜嫩的小豆腐 fresh and tender tofu = taking advantage of young girls</p>
<p>What kind of scoundrel could make a move on his own disciple? Su Yishui was truly a degenerate, rotten from the core!</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Zhou Feihua cautioned Ranran about many things, such as how young girls were easily deceived by men’s sweet words, and older men were cunning, hiding their malice well.</p>
<p>Ranran, knowing she was indirectly criticizing her master, had to defend him: “In order to save me, Shifu… is sometimes overcome by demonic influence and can lose control, but he has always been a gentleman. Don’t slander my Shifu like this!”</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua chuckled, “Who needs to slander him? Who do you think was the Demon’s son who caused Mu Qingge to be condemned by righteous people was? It was him, Su Yishui!”</p>
<p>Ranran glared but remained silent, but Zhou Feihua could tell the young girl was truly angry. However even if she was angry, she had to tell her the truth: “Back then, Su Yishui pretended to be severely injured and on the brink of death. He made use of his master, deceived her into opening the gate to the Netherworld realm, where he obtained the power of the Spirit Spring. Then, he incited his father to rebel and seize power. Which one of these things can be done by a good person?”</p>
<p>Ranran instinctively retorted, “You’re lying… Is there some misunderstanding?”</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua smiled coldly, “Misunderstanding? It’s hateful how he’s always deceiving women, bewitching Mu Qingge and manipulating her. She ended up bearing the blame for harboring  the Spirit Spring of the Demon’s son! And in the end, he turned himself into a righteous hero, claiming to exterminate evil, while Mu Qingge died because of him, still carrying that blame! Is this something a good person would do?”</p>
<p>Ranran felt somewhat speechless. If that was the case, her Shifu had indeed acted dishonorably. Did he really deliberately frame Elder Mu?</p>
<p>While the two were talking, Zhou Feihua suddenly looked past Ranran’s shoulder and saw Su Yishui standing under a tree. She immediately asked him, “You sure know how to pretend to be a good person in front of your disciple. Tell us, how did you ruin Qingge back then…”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>It turned out that Su Yishui had followed them without them noticing and had heard everything Zhou Feihua said.</p>
<p>Before she could finish, her entire body rose into the air as if pulled by an invisible force, and Su Yishui grabbed Zhou Feihua by the neck.</p>
<p>Seeing Su Yishui’s crimson red eyes, Ranran understood that Zhou Feihua’s words had triggered something demonic in him. She hurriedly leapt over and grabbed Su Yishui’s wrist, urgently saying, “Shifu! Control yourself, let go quickly, you might kill her like this!”</p>
<p>Seeing Su Yishui not loosening his grip but increasing the pressure, Ranran, had no other choice, she could only bite his arm.</p>
<p>Su Yishui, looking at her biting him, the redness in his eyes dissipated a little, and his grip on Zhou Feihua’s neck began to loosen.</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua had almost suffocated moments ago. After breaking free, she took several steps backwards, glaring and asked, “What’s this? You… cough … just realized you should kill and silence me?”</p>
<p>Ranran, afraid Zhou Feihua’s words would fan the flames and incite more trouble, quickly turned to her and gestured for her to be quiet. “You are already aware that my Shifu is at a very critical time right now. His temperament is not the same as he usually is. Please stop and refrain from provoking my Shifu any further.”</p>
<p>But before she could finish, Su Yishui coldly spoke up, “What she said is all true. I’m not the good person you think I am!”</p>
<p>After speaking, he didn’t even look at Ranran’s reaction and fell silent for a while before turning and leaving.</p>
<p>For some reason, Ranran, watching his receding straight figure as he left, felt a profound sense of pain and desolation…</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua finally recovered her breath and sighed in relief. However, the bruises on her neck were shocking, showing how much force Su Yishui had used just now.</p>
<p>Ranran applied a medicinal ointment to Zhou Feihua’s neck and asked in a small voice, “You said my master is a demon’s son, then…..did Mu Qingge know?”</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua stretched her neck for Ranran to apply the ointment and sighed again, saying hoarsely “Of course she knew, but she insisted that Su Yishui was bitter due to a difficult childhood and later felt resentful due to unfair treatment for his mother, leading to increasingly extreme thoughts. She was his master and couldn’t stand by while he fell into darkness. She said since she failed to teach her disciple properly, it’s only right for her to bear the blame on behalf of her disciple…”</p>
<p>Ranran knew that at first, Su Yishui had a deep misunderstanding of Mu Qingge, as seen in the “Playing Classics” Beasts chapter.</p>
<p>When Su Yishui silently ate the salted longan, did he think about seeking revenge against all those who had wronged him, including Mu Qingge, who didn’t understand him back then?</p>
<p>If so, then his subsequent retaliation against Mu Qingge would be understandable.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Ranran sighed softly again. Zhou Feihua looked at her and said, “Why are you sighing so much at such a young age? If he is harassing you, you can leave with me. Don’t let him deceive–“</p>
<p>Before she could finish speaking, Ranran reached out to cover her mouth, and desperately signaled her to be quiet. In a low voice, Ranran said, “My dear Lady, please don’t anger my Shifu anymore. Besides, even at his worst, his master never abandoned him. As his disciple, how can I leave him during his most difficult time?”</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua rolled her eyes and fell silent. In some ways, this young girl was just like her former close friend!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As for the incident of Shifu being possessed by the Spirit Spirit, Second Uncle Master, Gao Cang and the rest only discovered it later. Shifu’s entire demeanor changed, becoming somewhat unlike Su Yishui…</p>
<p>People are always like this, they only cherish what they lose.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier now deeply missed the past when her Shifu had a hands-off approach and spoke little.</p>
<p>In the past, if Su Yishui saw them not performing to expectations, he would at most give them a cold look and then only make them write extra assignments or run laps up and down the mountain.</p>
<p>But now, Shifu… seemed to still have remnants of the dragon’s influence, ready to spew venomous words at any time.</p>
<p>For example, after they descended the mountain and found an inn to stay in, finally able to enjoy some delicious food.</p>
<p>During dinner, Qiu Xier and Ranran fought over the chicken legs, a common occurrence among the XiShan disciples. Everyone was used to this.</p>
<p>In the past, Su Yishui would simply watch on silently, then give his own chicken leg to Ranran.</p>
<p>But now Su Yishui could say to Qiu Xier with a cold look, “Getting so fat that your clothes are about to burst open, and still so greedy? No wonder you never improved in your Lightness Technique; have you ever seen a sow climb a tree?”</p>
<p>In front of everyone at the table, Qiu Xier couldn’t hold back her tears after being ridiculed by the master like this. She burst into tears, then ran back to her room, skipping dinner altogether.</p>
<p>After Su Yishui finished speaking, he coldly scanned the table, and no one else dared to take any more food. They silently finished quickly what was left in their bowls and then slunk away.</p>
<p>Ranran also wanted to leave, but Su Yishui held her back and placed two large chicken legs from the plate into her bowl.</p>
<p>“Shifu, this is too much, how can I finish it all? Besides, if I eat so much… I’ll probably become too fat to climb trees…”</p>
<p>Su Yishui casually continued to serve her food, “Then get a bit fatter, it’ll be more comfortable to hug you.”</p>
<p>Hmm… its lucky that third senior sister isn’t here, or after hearing Su Yishui’s comments with extreme favoritism, she might likely die crying on the spot.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran really couldn’t bear to see her Shifu debase himself this way. She took him away from the inn and into the nearby woods. “Shifu, even if you’re possessed by the Spirit Spirit and feeling out of sorts, you must try to restrain yourself. Third senior sister is very sensitive; if you speak to her like this, she won’t be able to bear it.”</p>
<p>Su Yishui didn’t think he was being too harsh. He’s aware he speaks more sharply now, but it was only because of the Spirit Spring’s influence which no longer made him conceal himself, allowing him to express his true thoughts.</p>
<p>But he also knew that if the Spirit Spring’s possession were to continue too long, he will eventually lose control of himself. Among other concerns, he was most worried about hurting Ranran.</p>
<p>Every time he looked at her, uncontrollable desires surged in his heart. If she knew what he wanted to do to her, she would surely be frightened, run away and avoid him forever…</p>
<p>Seeing Shifu silent again with red eyes, Ranran quickly *humored him. She took out a honey-glazed hazelnut and stuffed it into his mouth.<br/>*顺毛驴  比喻顺着他的脾气和意愿就能很好相处，否则就不好相处的人<br/><em>Someone who is very easy to get along with if you don’t go against their wishes</em></p>
<p>Su Yishui seized the opportunity and pulled her into his arms, trying to calm himself, then said, “I’ll try my best…”</p>
<p>Ranran understood he meant that he will refrain from saying hurtful words in future. But as his disciple, teaching her master how to behave seemed somewhat inappropriate.</p>
<p>Wasn’t there supposed to be consequences according to Xishan’s rules for such misconduct?</p>
<p>Before Ranran could think it through, her thoughts were once again swept away by Su Yishui’s embrace and kiss, gone without a trace…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After their affectionate kiss, Ranran did manage to remember the main matter at hand.</p>
<p>Among all the events that happened in the palace before, the most puzzling was how Su Yu knew that Su Yishui once possessed the White Tiger.</p>
<p>This was something only the Xishan disciples knew, even their second senior brother did not know. Yet Su Yu was clearly well-informed, indicating a possible leak.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t want to speculate about the two senior uncle masters or Gaocang and Qiu Xier being the traitor.</p>
<p>So she had to first be on guard regarding matters pertaining to the Spirit Spring. Ranran had to be careful of eavesdroppers. With only the two of them in the woods, she took out a cloth bundle containing a book, which was the “Records of the Fantian Sect,” that they intended to get during their visit to the Capital.</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua passed her the book when they parted ways yesterday. It was because Ranran had mentioned they went to the palace to find a book from the Xishan archives.</p>
<p>On the day of the Dragon Boat Festival, chaos broke out in the collapsing palace and Su Yu had been caught by a dragon and taken to the skies. Everyone was in a panic.</p>
<p>Remembering Ranran’s request, Zhou Feihua took advantage of the confusion and avoiding Old Feng, snuck into Su Yu’s study, where she quickly found this unusually worn-out book on his usual bookshelf. She then passed it to her cousin from the Imperial Guards, to sneak it out of the palace in the chaos.</p>
<p>Afterwards, she was captured, and the Zhou family was raided. Fortunately, her cousin was quick-witted and hid the book under an old tree in the Zhou family’s backyard.</p>
<p>Followed by a series of events involving faking Zhou Feihua’s death, Ranran finally got her hands on this book.</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua’s intention was clear: “Su Yishui was originally a cunning person, and now being possessed by the Spirit Spring, he has turned into an evil being. What do you think a ‘demon’s son’ is? It’s a very rare person who can reach the Netherworld Realm and take away the Spirit Spring. They must bear immense grievances to become the demon’s son – a vessel for the Spirit Spring. Mu Qingge was misled by someone back then…If its as you have said, Su Yishui is willing to return the Spirit Spring to the Netherworld Realm, it would be a blessing for the world. Otherwise…”</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua didn’t finish her sentence. She couldn’t help but touch her neck, where the bruises had not yet faded.</p>
<p>She had to set off immediately to find her father and make arrangements to leave the country. Even though she couldn’t help worrying about this young girl, she could only earnestly give her advice, bid a heartfelt farewell and leave.</p>
<p>Su Yu hasn’t fully recovered yet, but once he has enough time later, he will definitely not let her father go. Only by fleeing far away can he temporarily avoid the current troubles.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Now, Ranran handed the book to Su Yishui, hoping to find a way to the Netherworld Realm from its contents.</p>
<p>Su Yishui looked at the book and suddenly asked Ranran, “I have said, that everything Zhou Feihua had said is true. Are you really not afraid of me at all?”</p>
<p>Ranran leaned against the tree trunk, looked up at him, and said softly, “Why should I be afraid? You once said that the little dragon, went on the wrong path because it was left unattended. Shifu, you are human, and you will inevitably make mistakes. But aren’t you silently making amends for your past mistakes? I think if Elder Mu knew everything you’ve done, she wouldn’t blame you too much…”</p>
<p>At this point, Ranran found it difficult to continue. Considering how Mu Qingge had secretly released the Immortal Devouring bugs on Tianmai Mountain, this master and disciple’s feud seems far from over.</p>
<p>It would seem that Elder Mu has not forgiven Su Yishui at all.</p>
<p>Su Yishui took once glance at her, and continued to silently flip through the old book with his long fingers.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>With both old books together, the next step was to carefully search for any clues inside. The book that was lent to the palace looked much older than the one left in Xishan. It seemed that Su Yu hadn’t stopped reading this book over the years.</p>
<p>The section about the “Seven Evil Transformation Curse” had been read repeatedly. Su Yu had likely studied it extensively over the years.</p>
<p>However, regarding information of the Netherworld Realm’s Spirit Spring, after searching the entire book, only a casual line was found – “<em>Below the Falling Water Cliff is the Spirit Spring</em>.”</p>
<p>Ranran was unsure if this was a description of the Netherworld Realm’s location, so she asked Shifu where the Falling Water Cliff was.</p>
<p>Su Yishui replied mildly, “It is said to be where heavenly water falls, creating a deep pit, bottomless abyss.”</p>
<p>Ranran frowned and thought for a while. She had never seen where heavenly water fell in such a manner on Earth, but there was a saying by poets: “The Yellow River’s waters comes from the sky.” Could this heavenly water refer to the source of the Yellow River?</p>
<p>Su Yishui nodded, then shook his head. He remembered that when he went to the Netherworld Realm before, although he headed north, it was far from the Yellow River, let alone be its source.</p>
<p>The entrance to the Netherworld Realm shifted each time, making it hard to pinpoint its exact location. However, right next to this line, there was an illustration of a red flower resembling an eagle’s beak.</p>
<p>Su Yishui squinted at it, recalling these strange flowers he saw at the entrance to the Netherworld Realm during his last visit.</p>
<p>Below the illustration, there was a line of annotation: <em>Eagle Beak Demon Flower, blooms from blood.</em></p>
<p>Seeing this, Ranran had an epiphany. *”Heavenly water” could also be understood as divine punishment. Every few decades in the mortal world, wars would break out at the borders, causing a time of great suffering, which could be seen as a divine punishment.<br/>*天水 </p>
<p>During the great battle of Fan Yao, Su Yishui had also seen these flowers on the battlefield.</p>
<p>So, this demonic flower, which marks the entrance to the Netherworld Realm, might grow in places with the most bloodshed.</p>
<p>Now that Da Qi and neighboring country Gao Kan were in conflict, perhaps that was where the demon flower was about to bloom.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>In any case, without other clues, they could only try with this direction and see if they could find any other leads.</p>
<p>Because Shifu couldn’t wait any longer.</p>
<p>As they left the inn, a rude guest from before, annoyed by the Xishan disciples’ carriage blocking his path, reached out and whipped their horses.</p>
<p>In the past, Shifu would have remained calm, secretly casting spells to teach a lesson to these arrogant bullies who only prey on the weak. But yesterday, Shifu actually lifted his leg and kicked the man into a tree. If Ranran hadn’t grabbed his arm with her life, Su Yishui would have probably killed the man.</p>
<p>From the moment they left the inn, it didn’t take long for their wanted posters to be plastered all over town.</p>
<p>The painter’s skills were good, or perhaps Old Feng had an exceptional memory; each portrait was very lifelike.</p>
<p>Only Qiu Xier, due to her extreme weight loss, did not resemble her portrait, making the fugitive third senior sister feel inexplicably pleased in her despair.</p>
<p>But now they were all wanted criminals in Da Qi. If they caused more public violence, Xishan’s reputation would be completely ruined.</p>
<p>Because Shifu’s mood was unpredictable and his killing intent was now too strong, they couldn’t stay in inns anymore and could only camp outdoors, as they headed towards the border.</p>
<p>During their journey, they visited Cuiwei Mountain, where Elder Jiu lived, hoping to get another talisman jade bottle for emergency use.</p>
<p>However, when they arrived at the foot of the mountain, they found that the once green fields were now barren, overgrown with weeds and untended.</p>
<p>The scarecrows that once worked in the fields were scattered, leaving only some dried grass and scattered clothes.</p>
<p>When they reached the peak of Cuiwei Mountain, the few houses had been burned to the ground, with charred wooden stakes and broken wine jars scattered everywhere.</p>
<p>Ranran inspected a half-empty jar of “Detain Heaven’s Immortal” wine outside.</p>
<p>For someone who loved alcohol so much, there was absolutely no reason to smash the wine jar before finishing it. What kind of trouble had Elder Jiu encountered to abandon this secluded place?</p>
<p>Ranran couldn’t help but worry about the old rascal. Elder Jiu has been living a peaceful life and shouldn’t have any major conflicts with others.</p>
<p>Who came looking for revenge? And where was he now? These were all unknowns.</p>
<p>Ranran repeatedly inspected the chaotic items on the mountain. Finally, under a stone outside the courtyard, she saw a few hastily scratched lines: “The Fantian Sect has revived, be careful…”</p>
<p>The word after “be careful” was incomplete, hastily scratched out, making it unrecognizable.</p>

<p>*形容人窝囊废，没用  <em>Actually I am not sure why this chapter is named this lol</em></p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>
<p>Ranran only discovered these words just now because she laid down on the ground.</p>
<p>Elder Jiu was probably lying here before and used his nails to write them at the bottom of the stone.</p>
<p>She slowly got up and then realized that the place where she had been lying down was a drag mark, with even traces of someone’s nails scratching the ground. It seemed that after someone had lain here, they were dragged away by someone else…</p>
<p>Ranran felt cold sweat on her back. Elder Jiu was not an common elder without any strength; being dragged away helplessly like this clearly indicated some kind of sinister trickery.</p>
<p>However, due to the angle, the person who dragged Elder Jiu away did not notice the traces he left at the bottom of the big stone. Was Elder Jiu trying to warn her Shifu and her?</p>
<p>Were the attackers from the remnants of the Fantian Sect?</p>
<p>As Ranran was examining the ground, Su Yishui also approached. After squatting down and seeing the line of words, he furrowed his brows tightly.</p>
<p>The Fantian Sect was a demonic sect from hundreds of years ago, a group of greedy individuals who were gathered and manipulated by the Spirit Spring when it intruded into the mortal realm.</p>
<p>Back then, when they first heard of this name, they had been tracing the Water Demon and only learned about it after coming to the Cuiwei Mountain from Elder Jiu.</p>
<p>However, the Fantian Sect had long been destroyed by a powerful figure Dun Tian, wiped from existence. So how could a group from the Fantian Sect suddenly emerge again?</p>
<p>Unable to find many clues, Ranran and the others had to descend from Cuiwei Mountain. When she looked up, she unintentionally saw a crow on a branch.</p>
<p>Elder Jiu used to communicate with the people below through this crow. But now, this crow had no talisman symbols on its feet, just tilting its head stupidly and cawing.</p>
<p>Ranran felt a little sad and resolved to find Elder Jiu’s whereabouts. His brother, the Medicine Immortal, had ascended, no longer concerned with worldly matters.</p>
<p>So, she, as his young brief acquaintance, was the only one left to worry about the old rascal’s fate.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When they were searching for clues on the mountain, Second Uncle Master did not come up. These past few days, Second Uncle Master had poor appetite, eating very little, mostly they ate and chatted during meals, she would take a cup of tea and go for a walk to relax.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier secretly whispered to her, speculating whether Second Uncle Master was expecting another bundle of joy with the scholar at the foot of Western Mountain.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t dare ask about that, but her Shifu probably thought so too. Second Uncle Master said she was a little fatigued, so he didn’t let her go up the mountain with them.</p>
<p>At this moment, Second Uncle Master was bored waiting, sitting on a large stone, staring blankly at the smoke rising from the nearby village.</p>
<p>Following her gaze, Ranran thought of something.</p>
<p>So on the pretext of buying some dried rations in the village, they managed to gather some clues from the villagers at the foot of Cuiwei Mountain.</p>
<p>Ten days ago, a group of outsiders came here. But it happened to be at night. Some people saw that those people were floating as they walked, with their heels not touching the ground.</p>
<p>This frightened several villagers who were catching loaches in the canal. It was said that one timid person, was so frightened to the point of vomiting bile, kept saying that they had seen a vengeful ghost.</p>
<p>Ranran, however, felt that what they saw was a group of cultivators who had mastered the Wind Control Technique. When using this technique, they would appear to be floating, as if riding the wind.</p>
<p>But when they got on the road mentioned by the villagers, Ranran’s nose was keen enough to detect the faint scent of <em>Detain Heaven’s Immortal</em> wine on the ground.</p>
<p>She thought that since Elder Jiu always carried a gourd of wine with him, if the cork of the gourd was not tightly sealed when he was abducted, the wine could have leaked along the way.</p>
<p>The scent of Detain Heaven’s Immortal  wine was distinctive, and it has not rained here for more than ten days, so the lingering aroma remained. Luckily, Ranran had a keen nose, much more sensitive than the average person, so she followed the faint scent of wine all the way to the side of the river port.</p>
<p>Right now, the boats at the river port were very busy.</p>
<p>With the border in flames and this being an important transit point for goods, the boatmen coming and going were all busy loading and unloading cargo.</p>
<p>Yuchen quickly learned that twenty days ago, the boats at this river port were all headed to *Wuma Town.<br/>*五马镇<em> literally Five Horses Town</em></p>
<p>There, a large army had been gathering, urgently needing supplies. As for merchants who wanted to go elsewhere, they were strictly prohibited from using the water route and were only allowed to travel by land.</p>
<p>In that case, did those people also take Elder Jiu on the boat to Wuma Town?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After hearing this, Su Yishui said, “In that case, let’s head to Wuma Town. After all, we already intended to investigate the front lines.”</p>
<p>Back then, Uncle Master Zeng took care of many businesses on behalf of Su Yishui, and in that Wuma Town, there was also a place called *Qianli Horse Trading Post, which would provide them with a place to stay.<br/>*千里 <em>Qianli is thousand miles</em></p>
<p>These past days, they had been roughing it outdoors. Qiu Xier also did not dare to eat much in front of her Shifu, causing her to suffer enough to lose some weight. Now, she was revealing a bit of her youthful and slender figure.</p>
<p>She was now looking forward to a soft bed and a good night’s sleep, and maybe sneak a big bowl of braised pork behind her Shifu’s back.</p>
<p>So, as they were about to reach Wuma Town, Qiu Xier was quite excited.</p>
<p>But when they arrived at the trading post, they found that this largest horse trading post in the area had their business signboard smashed to bits. The shopkeeper and the staff were not there, and there was only a seventy-year-old night watchman who spoke a local dialect that was difficult to understand. He gestured and pointed, trying to tell them that all the people from the horse trading post had been arrested by soldiers.</p>
<p>Yuchen and Gao cang exchanged looks with each other and quickly checked for any signs of surrounding activity.</p>
<p>After all, now the entire Xishan sect has been freshly labeled as wanted fugitives. It was said that along the route to Western Mountain, posters of them were plastered everywhere.</p>
<p>Of course, this wasn’t to make it easier for the soldiers to catch them. After all, they were cultivators, and ordinary soldiers couldn’t even get close, let alone capture them.</p>
<p>But this move effectively tarnished the reputation of Xishan.</p>
<p>Under this pretext, it was said that the three major sects had already gathered for a meeting, discussing whether to declare Xishan as a demonic sect. In the words of the Elder Kaiyuan, the Xishan sect had not repented, and was colluding with Mu Qingge to cause a dragon to destroy the palace, causing a great calamity.</p>
<p>Previously, Xishan had won the Tianmai Mountain’s Marrow Cleansing Pool event, which had displeased the three major sects.</p>
<p>So, although Elder Kaiyuan’s words had loopholes, no one delved into them. Instead, they all condemned Xishan sect, and it was even said that some sects were gathering their forces, preparing to seek justice from Su Yishui.</p>
<p>After all, Su Yishui’s actions had completely disrupted the balance between the cultivation world and the mundane world, causing trouble for fellow cultivators, which was unforgivable!</p>
<p>Now that something had happened to the horse trading post, was it because someone had noticed the connection between the post and Xishan?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>On high alert and inspecting the area thoroughly, Ranran found out what happened while inquiring at the sesame dessert stall in town.</p>
<p>The recent incident with the horse trading post had nothing much to do with the disciples from Xishan.</p>
<p>This area produces great horses from beyond the borders, so there are many horse traders coming and going.</p>
<p>Due to the urgent situation at the border, where there is a need for horses, so all horses in various places have been requisitioned, including those here.</p>
<p>In times of crisis at the border, the requisitioned horses naturally cannot be priced at market rates; they are only compensated with basic rates. However, most horse traders would not object, as everyone understands the principle of mutual support in times of need.</p>
<p>However, just yesterday, a group of soldiers arrived and arrested all the shopkeepers and assistants at the horse trading post. They sent word that the owner should come to the military camp for questioning as soon as possible.</p>
<p>It was said that something went wrong with the horses handed over by the horse trading post. On the second day after handing over the horses, these horses were sent to the camp for deployment.</p>
<p>The horses handed over from other places were all fine, but only the horses from Qianli Horse Trading post had become extremely agitated when they reached Yanxing Mountain. They neighed wildly, causing great distress to the soldiers riding them, and what’s worse, a general was injured.</p>
<p>So, the military camp concluded that someone from Qianli Horse Trading post had tampered with these requisitioned horses, intending harm to the soldiers. That’s why they arrested the shopkeepers for interrogation.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Qiu Xier’s long-awaited warm bed and braised pork were now gone with the wind.</p>
<p>The wanted individuals had to retreat into the woods again.</p>
<p>However, Yu chen was experienced in building tents in the military camp, so he bought a cowhide tent in town. With Gao Cang’s help, they set up camp on the mountain, finally avoiding exposure to the elements.</p>
<p>When Gao Cang went to town with Senior Uncle Master, he brought back a piece of good pork belly, along with condiments like oil, sugar, soy sauce, and an iron pot.</p>
<p>While washing the meat by the stream, Ranran teased Qiu Xier, “Senior brother really spoils you. Look, you said you wanted braised pork, and he bought it to satisfy your craving.”</p>
<p>Qiu Xier had indeed become quite close to senior brother recently. However, she felt that her own matters were insignificant compared to Ranran’s.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Now she also noticed something unusual between Ranran and their master, so she asked quietly, “Shifu is so intimidating now, yet you still dare to get close to him. I saw you two sitting on the stone at the mountaintop looking at the moon yesterday. Are you really planning to become immortal partners with him?”</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t think that far ahead. Right now, she just hoped to safely return the Spirit Spring.</p>
<p>When their Shifu returned to normal… naturally, it would be as if nothing had happened. Talking about immortal partners or not would be irrelevant.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier was familiar with cultivation stories and became anxious when Ranran said she hadn’t thought that far ahead. She said, “You now also have some cultivation foundation. But do think it through. It is said that if you become immortal partners, advancing in cultivation becomes even more difficult.”</p>
<p>Ranran understood what Qiu Xier meant.</p>
<p>After all, their cultivation levels were different, and their time for ascension will also be different. Often, after one person ascended, they would cut off worldly ties. Even if they met again in the future, they would only treat each other with respect and courtesy, like strangers. Worse still, if one failed to ascend for a long time, they would become like Houyi and Chang’e, separated between two worlds, filled with regrets.”</p>
<p>Ranran felt Qiu Xier made sense. However, it seems that Shifu did not seem very interested in things like foundation building and ascension.</p>
<p>Given his talent, his current cultivation level should far exceed the powerful figures preparing for ascension in the three major sects.</p>
<p>However, compared to twenty years ago, Shifu’s cultivation did not seem to have progressed much. During the last ascension attempt of the powerful figures and their heavenly tribulation tests, he was not included.</p>
<p>However, with his two Beast Control feats, as well as sealing the Spirit Spring with his own body, all these things proved that Shifu’s cultivation is much greater than what he shows.</p>
<p>After all, being able to overcome the control of the spiritual spring requires immense willpower and spiritual energy support.</p>
<p>With such capabilities, why did Shifu stop advancing, choosing to remain confined to the small little West Mountain?</p>
<p>Ranran knows her own limitations, even if she was so fortunate to become immortal partners with Shifu, her current cultivation level was far from his. As Qiu Xier said, accompanying in cultivation sometimes may just be to pass the boring years. If they were destined not to be together in the end, there was no need to take it seriously from the start.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Their Shifu’s nightly activities everyday recently, mainly involved getting her to admire the moon and night scenery with him, Ranran wasn’t sure, but Shifu seemed to have been here before.</p>
<p>He seemed to know where all the beautiful scenery were. For example, yesterday, he took her to a mountain hollow full of little purple flowers. When night fell, in just a moment, they saw fireflies dancing among the flowers.</p>
<p>Ranran had never seen so many fireflies before. Shining on the purple flowers, they seemed to be covered in falling starlight, incredibly beautiful.</p>
<p>Shifu even brought a small net for her to catch fireflies with. Ranran enjoyed herself very much, she then lamented that it would be great if there was a firefly lantern.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, as soon as she finished speaking, Su Yishui took out a paper lantern made of paper. During the day, Ranran had seen Shifu cutting wood and using paper he brought with him to make something, but she didn’t expect him to be making a lantern for her.</p>
<p>When she put the captured fireflies inside, she discovered simple line drawings on the four sides of the paper lantern.</p>
<p>There was a man and a woman sitting on a tree branch under the moon, looking at a sea of flowers. When fireflies danced in the flower sea, the fireflies on the lantern’s flower sea also danced…</p>
<p>One couldn’t tell clearly if this was inside or outside the painting. And whether Su Yishui had intended to paint this present scene… or was it a memory from his past.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran considered Shifu’s thoughtful preparations, became more convinced that he had been to these places before. These clever ideas were obviously not something a prickly free spirited man would think of.</p>
<p>So she tentatively asked, “Shifu, have you been here before?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui was silent for a moment and replied, “Yes, I have…”</p>
<p>Ranran gently swayed the delicate paper lantern and asked again, “So Shifu you have made a lantern for someone else before?”</p>
<p>This time, Su Yishui shook his head. Looking at the fluorescence of the night, he said faintly, “This is the first time I made one. But someone once made a lantern for me to cheer me up…”</p>
<p>Ranran listened, suddenly feeling an indescribable discomfort in her heart. She took a deep breath silently and said in a small voice, “Then Shifu must have been as happy as I am now?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui half-raised his head, remained silent for a while, and then said in a low voice, “I was in a bad mood at that time and smashed that lantern to pieces…”</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t expect the memory of this beautiful scene to turn out like this. She was momentarily speechless, suddenly guessing that the person who made the lantern to cheer up her Shifu was probably Elder Mu.</p>
<p>So now, why did he make this lantern for her? Did he also hope that she would tear it apart and throw it back at his face to compensate for his guilt towards Elder Mu?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Ranran lost interest in the scenery. Now that she thought about it, these past few days, fishing under the moon together, picking bird eggs with Shifu during the day, all these joyful experiences, Shifu might have done them with Elder Mu before.</p>
<p>Although Elder Mu has changed now, Shifu still reminisces about the past, so he brought her along to make up the number in order to relive those moments.</p>
<p>After Su Yishui finished speaking, he still seemed to be immersed in the past. By the time he turned his head, he found that Ranran had used a finger to poke the lantern into a sieve, and all the fireflies inside had escaped.</p>
<p>Ranran then handed the broken lantern back to Shifu, with lowered eyes, said, “I’m tired and want to go back to sleep.”</p>
<p>With that, she lightly left and went down the mountain on her own.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When she returned, Qiu xier and the others had already gone to bed. Ranran went back to her small tent, suddenly feeling like she had eaten too much tonight, feeling stuffy and uncomfortable in her chest for no apparent reason.</p>
<p>Just then, Su Yishui seemed to have returned as well, stopping outside her tent. Ranran didn’t want to speak to him and muttered from under the blanket, “Shifu, I’m tired and want to sleep early.”</p>
<p>Thinking he would leave, Ranran was startled when Su Yishui reached in and pulled her out of the tent. She thought that Shifu’s demonic side had strengthened again.</p>
<p>But Su Yishui had closed his eyes and tilted his head, asking, “What do you hear?”</p>
<p>Ranran quickly closed her eyes too, focusing and listening intently. After a while, she heard a thunderous sound rolling over.</p>
<p>“What… What is this?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui frowned and said, “It’s the sound of a herd of horses running.”</p>
<p>The herd of horses should still be far from them, but both of their hearing abilities were better than ordinary people, so they heard it early.</p>
<p>Su Yishui got down on the ground to listen carefully, then looked up and said, “There should be around five to six hundred horses in this group, running towards us.”</p>
<p>To avoid attracting attention from the authorities, they were hiding near the border mountains this time. Beyond this mountain was the territory of Gao Kan.</p>
<p>It was late at night, could it be that the Da Qi soldiers were preparing a night raid on Gao Kan’s camp, so the horses were galloping furiously at night?</p>
<p>After about the time it takes to burn an incense stick, in the vast open field below the mountain, a large number of horses were indeed running under the moonlight.</p>
<p>Ranran and Su Yishui stood on the tallest tree on the mountaintop, watching clearly. Contrary to Ranran’s original guess, these horses were all bareback, without saddles or reins, and no soldiers were riding them.</p>
<p>If they were being herded, why would they be herded at night? Moreover, these horses seemed to be running on their own without anyone driving them. Why wouldn’t they sleep at night but instead keep running?</p>
<p>As Ranran puzzled over this, Su Yishui suddenly said, “Let’s go. Go down the mountain and take a look.”</p>
<p>So the two of them went down the mountain with the wind, quickly arriving at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>When they reached the edge of the horse herd, under the bright moon in the sky, Ranran quickly noticed something peculiar about these horses.</p>
<p>It seemed like something was attached to the backs of these horses.</p>
<p>Ranran hastened her pace and ran alongside the horses. She quickly reached out and tore off a piece of paper from a horse’s back.</p>
<p>At that moment the paper was taken off, the horse seemed to instantly lose all its strength, neighing and convulsing before falling to the ground, foaming at the mouth, looking to be in extreme pain.</p>
<p>Ranran quickly took out a pill to protect its heart and fed it to the horse, then looked down at the piece of paper in her hand. She immediately recognized it as a beast-control talisman made by Elder Jiu.</p>
<p>Looking up, Ranran saw that the backs of all the passing horses were also stuck with these talismans.</p>
<p>It was obvious, someone was compelling them to run wildly. And with these horses running so recklessly, by the time they reached their destination, they would probably be half dead.</p>
<p>Su Yishui said in a low voice, “These horses should be the ones requisitioned for the Da Qi military camp. Someone is making them run into Gao Kan’s territory, so that the Da Qi army will have no horses to use.”</p>
<p>Ranran gasped at the revelation. Setting aside the jerk sitting on the throne, the current war was related to the safety of the border people of both countries, not just Su Yu’s personal national affairs.</p>
<p>The new king of Gao Kan was a cruel tyrant. It was said that when he was still a crown prince, because he suffered a defeat in battle, he had massacred all the Da Qi villagers he saw along the way, which was truly appalling.</p>
<p>If Da Qi failed this time, the people along the border would probably not be spared. Elder Jiu wouldn’t help such a brutal person even if he was innately mischievous.</p>
<p>Moreover… Elder Jiu has never been one to be interested in current affairs. It was unclear how someone from Gao Kan was so well-connected, and managed to go to Cuiwei Mountain to capture Elder Jiu, and even forced him to use talismans to aid tyranny?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As she thought about this, she looked at Shifu. When their eyes met, they immediately understood each other’s intentions. So the two of them each chose a horse, grabbed the horse’s mane, and rode along with the herd.</p>
<p>The herd quickly crossed the border and entered Gao Kan’s territory.</p>
<p>In front of them, they could see campfires in the military camp. The two of them quickly dismounted and, after some twists and turns, sneaked into the camp.</p>
<p>When they leaped onto a tall tree, Ranran overheard people inside the tent talking, “These talismans really work so well. In a few days, the generals of Da Qi will have to fight in the front lines riding donkeys and plowing oxen…”</p>
<p>Hearing this, the people inside burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Then someone said, “Since we have Immortals assisting us, we Gao Kan will definitely win this time! Why bother sending troops to fight, just use immortal techniques to turn beans into soldiers!”</p>
<p><br/>Just then, a cold and clear female voice spoke, “Don’t forget that there is a price to pay for helping you with these things. You have to spread the word, say that it was Immortal Su from the Western Mountain who assisted you in obtaining these talismans and getting this group of horses.”</p>
<p>The person laughed, “Lady Immortal, rest assured, we understand. The name is Su Yishui right? He and his disciples have offended the Emperor of Da Qi, so they fled in fear of punishment and came to Gao Kan. Our King has already appointed him as the Imperial Advisor.”</p>
<p>The woman snorted, “You better carry out these things well. There are even greater benefits awaiting in the future. Don’t forget to give those horses the spiritual water I gave you. Otherwise, after such long-distance travel, without timely replenishment of spiritual energy, they will drop dead immediately.”</p>
<p>After saying this, the woman strode out of the tent.</p>
<p>In the moonlight, Ranran looked at the woman, feeling like she have seen her before. Upon closer inspection, wasn’t she Elder Tu Jiuyuan under Wei Jiu’s command!</p>
<p>Ranran suddenly understood that Elder Jiu must have been captured by the people sent out by the Crimson Gate Sect. And Wei Jiu instructed Elder Tu, to collude with the officials of Gao Kan, intending to frame and harm the Xishan Sect!</p>
<p>The unwritten rule in the cultivation world has always been to avoid entanglements with the mundane world. Their previous intrusion into the palace had already committed a major taboo, causing dissatisfaction among the cultivators.</p>
<p>And now, if such rumors spread, that Su Yishui has helped the tyrannical King of Gao Kan win a battle, not only in the cultivation world but also within the territory of Da Qi, the Xishan sect would become *immediate targets for eradication!<br/>*臭鱼烂虾 <em>was used here</em></p>
<p>Wei Jiu’s scheme is truly despicable. When the time comes, Xishan Sect would be crushed by everyone. Even the families of their disciples would face humiliation and abuse.</p>
<p>The Xishan Sect would be completely degraded to the demonic path, with no hope of turning the tide.</p>

<p><em>” The missing <em>braised pork</em></em> <em>dinner “</em></p>
<p>Small complaint but I got confused translating. The author seemed to get confused with the time line and carried away with the long narration of events?</p>
<p>We see Ranran chatting with Xier, and the example about how she was upset after playing with the firefly lantern was from ‘last night’. </p>
<p>Yet, the events of ‘last night’ involved an entire adventure heading into the enemy camp and dealing with a setup involving horses controlled by talismans? But they had just started camping and preparing to braise meat while they chat about their love lives? </p>
<p>Well I suppose we just have to accept that this happened, within those few days haha<br/>If you saw something I missed, please enlighten me!</p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:50px"></div>
<p>Poor Su Yishui…..he is trying to share the beautiful scenes that Mu Qingge had shown him before, with her again, but now Ranran feels upset because 1) she feels like a replacement 2) nobody ever feels great thinking about the ex of someone you like <em>lol</em><br/>But when he did this, did he merely want to make her happy, showing her scenery that delighted her before? Was it for himself to relive the moment and address his own regret?</p>
<p>Perhaps retaining Mu Qingge’s intelligence and maturity, Ranran has never seemed to be just a typical young naive girl, which we got to see in the early chapters, when she advised her parents on how to deal with the village bully.</p>
<p>Here, she was not just some starry-eyed girl who will fall for Shifu’s romantic gestures without question and she tried to understand his frame of mind. I actually really like this. <br/>This way, Ranran won’t like Shifu just because he did nice things for her, and she evaluates her own feelings properly and not blindly rush into anything.</p>
<p>Still, its a good development that she is starting to feel bothered and upset about who Shifu likes. <br/>If she was really so carefree, indifferent and above it all, totally fine with their relationship going back to how it was before the ‘lecherous Spirit Spring’ appeared, things won’t look so good for our Shifu!</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>
<p><strong><em>One last note</em></strong></p>
<p>It would seem that in the past Xishan was actually a ‘demonic’ sect right? <br/>I remember that Mu Qingge was supposed to be a talented Yin cultivator, and specialized in demonic cultivation. <br/>Why was it fine back then, but no longer tolerated now? Was it because after the Netherworld realm incident, people no longer trusted those who were on the demonic path? <br/>Life’s so tough for our demonic cultivators, like Wei Wuxian <em>ouch</em></p>
<p>By the way, if you are new to the world of cultivation, the animated series <a href="https://youtu.be/m346FShZ5Dc" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation 魔道祖师</a> will really help understand this world of cultivation, forming golden core, riding the wind, using spirit power with a zither, and basically running around subduing demons with a master!<br/></p>

<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>When Ranran thought of this, she was so angry that she stood up and drew out her small dagger. Su Yishui *sent her a DM to ask, “What do you want to do?”<br/><em>*I had to sorry! lol maybe it should be SM because… secret message</em></p>
<p>After her spiritual veins were reconnected on the island, with guidance from Su Yishui, Ranran was now also proficient in the technique to channel secret messages. She glared at Shifu and silently channeled, “Of course, it’s to kill that woman. Shifu, aren’t you angry after hearing this? Why haven’t your eyes turned red?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui cast her a glance and said, “Didn’t you ask me to control my temper?”</p>
<p>Its true, since that day after she spoke to Shifu, he hadn’t verbally attacked anyone again. However, because he had nowhere else to vent his anger, he always took her to see the moon at night, catching fireflies…</p>
<p>Now wasn’t the time for Ranran to praise her master’s efforts in temperament control. After Tu Jiuyuan led her subordinates away, she and Su Yishui followed from a distance to see where she was heading.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan hurried to another tent. Before she could collect herself, a clear voice came from inside the tent, “Elder Tu, you’re back? How are things arranged?”</p>
<p>Ranran, hiding in the bushes, widened her eyes with suspicion. This voice… if she was right, wasn’t it Mu Qingge?</p>
<p>Back when she and her Shifu entered the palace, Mu Qingge had been entrusted to the Yu siblings, Yu Chen and Yu Tong.</p>
<p>But later, she managed to escape. Who could have thought, she would end up here in Gao Kan, and even got involved with Tu Jiuyuan.</p>
<p>After hearing Mu Qingge’s question, Tu Jiuyuan coldly said, “Its just bringing some horses to Gao Kan, not some insurmountable task. What could go wrong?”</p>
<p>Mu Qingge’s voice continued, “The talismans on those horses are the same as the ones Xue Ranran usually use. Many disciples from the three major sects who went to Tianmai Mountain have seen them. My disciple Qin Xuanjiu can also testify. So, whether these horses can come over is not important. What’s important was whether a few talismans fell into the hands of the Da Qi garrison when those horses were driven away?”</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan laughed dryly, “Naturally, a few talismans did fall, but I really admire Elder Mu’s mind. You actually came up with such a scheme to frame others? Now, the reputation of Xishan Sect is completely ruined. I wonder what benefits you’ll get from this?”</p>
<p>After hearing this, Mu Qingge in the tent smiled slightly. She knew that Tu Jiuyuan didn’t have a good opinion of her, fearing that she would steal Wei Jiu’s favor.</p>
<p>She couldn’t be bothered with this petty woman either.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>What benefits could there be in framing Xishan Sect? There were plenty. She had been reborn, with the hope of using Su Yishui’s indebtedness to her to return to Xishan.</p>
<p>The ice lotus pool in the Western Mountain, the alchemy furnace, and the nurturing spiritual energies of the mountain would all have been greatly beneficial to her cultivation.</p>
<p>But unexpectedly, Su Yishui seemed to have perceived her true identity early on, decisively refusing to let her return. From then on, she was like a stray dog, with no fixed abode.</p>
<p>The Tianmai Mountain incident made her a target of public criticism. Forced to seek refuge in the palace, she was double-crossed by that devious Su Yu. Not only did she end up being used by him, her spiritual power had been damaged by the Trigram foundation of the palace.</p>
<p>When she  finally realized that she could be easily controlled by someone with an inadequate foundation like Xue Ranran, it was as if Mu Ranwu finally woke up from her dream.</p>
<p>She did not return to life, just to become someone’s pawn! She was now Mu Qingge!</p>
<p>If she couldn’t fully utilize the resources left by her elder sister, she would have come back to this life in vain.</p>
<p>Therefore, after much thought, she decided not to return to the Da Qi palace. Su Yu probably wouldn’t have long to live either. She needed to find anther patron who could benefit her.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Recently, because of Mu Qingge’s reputation, many of her former disciples came to seek refuge with her. Back then, others thought Mu Qingge was too casual in taking disciples, making her choices based only on appearance.</p>
<p>Little did they know, there were many hidden talents among these disciples.</p>
<p>At present, among her disciples are Wang Sui Zhi, who owns money banks all over the land. There were also several disciples who have joined other sects, resumed their cultivation practice, and are now determined to avenge their master.</p>
<p>Now, even though she had a notorious reputation among the three major sects, her disciples, like Qin Xuanjiu, rushed to her like lambs.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu used to be unwilling to deal with them mainly because she was afraid of exposing her true identity. But now that her previous plans had failed, she had to rely on these disciples.</p>
<p>Fortunately, she often followed her sister around and was well aware of the disciples’ daily routines, so as long as she was cautious in her words, she wouldn’t give herself away yet.</p>
<p>With the support of Wang Suizhi’s wealth, Mu Ranwu’s days after leaving the palace were quite comfortable.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Unfortunately, Wang Suizhi only had wealth and lacked power and influence. So, she thought of the new King Yiling of Gao Kan. When he was still a crown prince, he had some interactions with Mu Qingge in the past.</p>
<p>Back then, King Yiling wanted to appoint Mu Qingge as the Imperial advisor and recommended her to his father. However, Mu Qingge coldly refused, stating that she was a cultivator and not interested in worldly wealth and glory.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu was somewhat regretful then, because King Yiling was the most favored prince of Gao Kan and was destined to ascend the throne. Why offend such a person?</p>
<p>But later on, Mu Qingge went back on her words and got involved in worldly affairs, supporting Su Yu to become the new Emperor of Da Qi. This made King Yiling deeply resentful but also confirmed Mu Qingge’s ability to change heaven’s will and rewrite fate.</p>
<p>King Yiling was greatly ambitious from an early age, repeatedly provoking border conflicts even as a prince. Now as King Yiling, his greed had grown, and he definitely coveted the riches of Da Qi.</p>
<p>After Mu Ranwu made her decision, she decided to make use of King Yiling to seek revenge on Su Yu and Su Yishui, these two despicable men!</p>
<p>Although King Yiling was ruthless, he was far easier to manipulate than Su Yu, who was cunning and unscrupulous.</p>
<p>When she appeared with Mu Qingge’s face, even with scars, it still excited King Yiling greatly.</p>
<p>During the Battle of Fan Yao, when King Yiling was still a prince, he had watched from afar. That scene where Mu Qingge had rode a giant dragon, commanding a white tiger on the battlefield, a sight that was unforgettable.</p>
<p>With such a capable Battle Goddess defecting to him, even though King Yiling had been annoyed by her previous refusal, he wouldn’t show it. With Mu Qingge by his side, it wouldn’t be long before he could conquer the land and become the supreme ruler of the world!</p>
<p>As for Su Yu, she would never let him off either. Wasn’t he most concerned about his kingdom? Without it, he would be a pitiful, worthless sickly creature, pitied by no one even if left on the streets!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>However, to establish a foothold in Gao Kan, she had to demonstrate some abilities. At the time, Tu Jiuyuan from Crimson Gate suddenly sought her out, offering a spiritual medicine to treat facial injuries and proposing a partnership with their Excellency.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu felt that there was no need to cooperate with Wei Jiu so she turned her down flatly. She was somewhat wary of that Wei demon. He was also a winner of the marrow-cleansing pool and also practiced the demonic arts. If she wasn’t careful and fell for his schemes, he could drain her spiritual power completely.</p>
<p>But Wei Jiu knew how to understand her intentions well. After mentioning capturing Elder Jiu who drew talismans for Xue Ranran and outlining his plan, Mu Ranwu couldn’t help but be tempted.</p>
<p>After several discussions, they finally reached an agreement. So, she acted as a mediator, bridging the gap between Wei Jiu and King Yiling.</p>
<p>Next was to activate the Gao Kan undercover agents in the Da Qi military camp, attach spells to the horses in the camp, and let Mu Qingge control the horses. They had done a small test before, and the horses with spells were compliant, even seriously injuring a general.</p>
<p>If they fought at the front lines and Mu Qingge suddenly manipulated the Qi army’s horses, the results would be phenomenal. But hearing that many talented individuals from Yiren Hall had recently joined the Da Qi army over the past few days, Mu Qingge was worried that this tactic might be exposed. So, she decided to summon all of Da Qi’s warhorses tonight to destroy the morale of the Da Qi army.</p>
<p>As for Wei Jiu, he seemed to be playing both sides between Da Qi and Gao Kan, and she didn’t know what he promised to Su Yu’s side. Mu Ranwu knew clearly that everyone was just using each other, taking what they needed. It was all about who was more cunning and played the game smarter.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran listened outside the tent and couldn’t help but turn to look at Su Yishui.</p>
<p>She never expected Elder Mu to have become so reckless and indifferent to right and wrong.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge was not just getting involved in worldly affairs but also aiding and abetting, inheriting *Shen Gongbao’s legacy!<br/>*申公豹 Shen Gongbao <em>was a villain in the mythical legends</em></p>
<p>She didn’t dare to stay here too long, not because she was afraid. It was just that her Shifu was now like a human talisman bottle, unpredictable and volatile in temperament. If he really started a fight, she was afraid it would lead to bloodshed and the Spirit Spring’s demonic nature might even take control of him.</p>
<p>So she pulled her Shifu away from the Gao Kan camp.</p>
<p>When they were out, Xue Ranran quietly asked her master’s opinion. Su Yishui said, “The mandate of heaven cannot be violated in the mortal world. Getting involved in these mundane matters will only damage the cultivation path. Wei Jiu and others like to meddle, let them meddle on their own.”</p>
<p>Ranran felt that her master didn’t grasp the key point, “But they clearly intend to use the loss of the horses to frame Xishan and make us bear the infamy! Also, Elder Jiu seems to be in their hands. Can we really just sit back and watch without saving him?”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Su Yishui seemed to be indifferent to the opinions of others. He was now without parents and attachments, moreover he had never been one who cared about what others thought.</p>
<p>As for him residing in Western Mountain, it was only because Mu Qingge had lived there before. If he couldn’t return to Western Mountain, he could easily find East Mountain, North Mountain, or South Mountain to live in. Cultivators valued solitude, and his worldly possessions had always been managed by Zeng Yi. Building a palace on a mountain top was not a problem.</p>
<p>However, since Ranran cared, he would still help her. He was hard-hearted, unlike her, who was deeply sentimental, whether in this life or the previous one, this had never changed.</p>
<p>Even though he had used her in the past and stolen the Spirit Spring, Qingge had never given up on him. He can betray the entire world, but he still owed Qingge an emotional debt that he can never fully repay.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>In the past, he only wanted to become the strongest in the world, using any means necessary, willing to help his father seize the world and then take over.</p>
<p>Because the Spirit Spring had once said that if he could extinguish emotions and sever love, he would become the supreme ruler of this generation, surpassing even the highest great powers like Duntian.</p>
<p>At the edge of the marrow-cleansing pool, he had decisively chosen the dark pool. Emotions and love were useless things, not something he needed at all.</p>
<p>But in the end, his feelings had been stirred without him realizing it. It wasn’t until Mu Qingge took the blame for stealing the Spirit Spring, and at that moment when she lost her life before him, did he realize how heart-wrenching the things he had once abandoned were…</p>
<p>Su Yishui still couldn’t recall how he had spent that period of time. He just let his body drive him, numbly going back and forth to take care of the rebirth tree that may or may not succeed in saving her residual soul.</p>
<p>Every time he saw a new leaf grow on its withered branches, his heart would flutter a bit. It wasn’t until it slowly bore frail little fruits, containing familiar spiritual power, that his long-cold heart finally began to soften a little in the winter chill.</p>
<p>At that time, he swore a vow, that in this life, she wouldn’t have to bear heavy burdens for anyone. Not even for Mu Qingge herself!</p>
<p>Although he felt nothing for things like friendship, he didn’t want her to have any bit of sadness in this life.</p>
<p>Since she was worried about the old drunkard, and concerned that her parents and fellow disciples might be implicated and labeled as traitors, then he wouldn’t let the evil schemes of these people succeed.</p>
<p>Considering these, he replied mildly, “You’re right. What do you plan to do? Tell me…..”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, the Da Qi military camp was already in chaos in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>The warhorses locked in the stables collectively went berserk without warning, ramming the fences continuously. With some unknown strength, they even broke the thick wooden fences and then galloped out of the camp.</p>
<p>Many soldiers trying to stop them couldn’t dodge in time and were knocked down and trampled by the horses.</p>
<p>Watching the horses gallop away while they had no horses to pursue them, the generals and soldiers could only sigh and shake their heads in frustration.</p>
<p>Just as the commander and his generals were watching the dust kicked up by the running horses with urgency and regret, someone found scattered talismans in the stables.</p>
<p>Because Qin Xuanjiu was in charge of the cavalry camp due to military arrangements, he widened his eyes when he saw them.</p>
<p>These animal-controlling talismans were exactly the same as the ones used by Su Yishui and Xue Ranran before. Thinking of the recent rumors about Su Yishui causing chaos in the palace at the Capital, Qin Xuanjiu increasingly shocked and angry.</p>
<p>What was Su Yishui trying to do? First, he attempted regicide, and now he was betraying Da Qi to assist the barbarians of Gao Kan?</p>
<p>Considering Su Yishui’s temperament, such actions were entirely in line with his character. After all, he was the son of a rebel prince. Back then, he was almost restored to his prince status. If he had supported Prince Ping to become emperor, maybe he would have a chance to inherit the throne.</p>
<p>The more Qin Xuanjiu thought about it, the angrier he became. He reported this directly to the commander.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>At the same time, Lao Feng from Yiren Hall in the Capital arrived with a group of people, along with representatives from the three major sects.</p>
<p>The Gao Kan army was approaching aggressively, and a massacre was imminent. Although the three major sects were cultivators, Master Kaiyuan of Jiuhua Sect was deeply involved in worldly affairs and had a close relationship with the Da Qi royal family.</p>
<p>He was very enthusiastic about things that accumulated merit like stopping wars. So, this time he led his disciples personally.</p>
<p>As for the other two major sects, they were not interested in these matters, but due to Master Kaiyuan’s persuasion and arrangements, they could only send some disciples to come along to make an appearance.</p>
<p>Initially, it was just a formality for them to show up. Unexpectedly, as soon as they arrived at the military camp, they encountered the incident of someone using talismans to control the horses and lead them out of the camp.</p>
<p>Master Kaiyuan frowned as he listened to Qin Xuanjiu’s hesitant recounting and slammed the table in anger.</p>
<p>“Su Yishui from Xishan has really gone out of line! I thought he was different from his demonic master, relatively upright in character. But now, it seems he has surpassed the female demon Mu Qingge and is on the path to surpassing her completely! Gao Kan, the new king, is cruel, yet he aids him in his tyranny. It’s simply a disgrace to the cultivation world!”</p>
<p>“Master Kaiyuan, you’re mistaken. What ability do I have to compare with someone as unfathomable as Su Yishui?” With a clear voice, Mu Qingge led her disciples who had come to seek refuge with her and walked in gracefully.</p>
<p>This time, all the representatives of the three major sects drew their swords and glared angrily at the woman who had entered.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu was prepared and calmly said, “That day on Tianmai Mountain, Xue Ranran misled everyone, twisted right and wrong, colluded with Wen Hongshan and slandered me. I couldn’t defend myself, so I had to leave first.”</p>
<p>The newly appointed elder of Kongshan Sect, Wen Chunhui, sneered, “Although Wen Hongshan is a traitor of Kongshan Sect, if she didn’t act on someone’s instructions, why would she do such things? Now that she has been killed by someone in the midst of confusion, you intend to spout nonsense freely?”</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu frowned and said, “I didn’t know the reason at the time, but later I discovered that someone had stuck a talisman on my back. Upon careful reflection, it must have been manipulated when I was on Tianmai Mountain, which led to the act of releasing the Immortal devouring bug. As to this matter, General Qin can testify for me.”</p>
<p>Being called upon by his master, Qin Xuanjiu immediately nodded and said, “Yes, there was indeed a talisman stuck on Master’s body…”</p>
<p>Actually, Qin Xuanjiu wasn’t very clear about the situation on Tianmai Mountain. It was just that later, when he asked his master about the rumors circulating outside, his master explained it this way.</p>
<p>Of course, Qin Xuanjiu believed his master’s words. Moreover, didn’t that damned Su Yishui draw some nonsense runes under his feet? It made him forget to tell his master about the matter of the Spirit Spring at that time.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Master Kaiyuan snorted inwardly but smiled agreeably on the surface and said, “If that’s the case, then we have misunderstood Elder Mu. But since he was once your disciple, and now he’s so audacious, shouldn’t Elder Mu assist us in subduing the monsters of Xishan?”</p>
<p>If they could recruit this bitch Mu Qingge to deal with Xishan, that would be the best outcome. Seeing the former master and disciple in deep conflict and himself reaping the benefits, wouldn’t that be just perfect?</p>
<p>So, after listening to Mu Qingge’s feeble explanation, Master Kaiyuan surprisingly accepted it easily, only wanting to direct the spearhead at Su Yishui and the others right now.</p>
<p>The three major sects had suffered heavy losses in the last Marrow-Cleansing Pool gathering on Tianmai Mountain, with severe injuries and depleted vital energy. Only Xishan sect escaped unscathed and greatly benefited. Recently, many outstanding cultivators even aspired to join Xishan, reducing the number of disciples coming to Jiuhua, which made Master Kaiyuan very uncomfortable. Now he just wanted to destroy Xishan first and make other plans later.</p>
<p>The attitudes of the other sects towards Xishan were also very nuanced. Human nature was such that if someone had a bias against someone, they would believe anything negative about them, seizing upon any pretext to imagine all the crimes they might have committed.</p>
<p>Master Kaiyuan nodded, and others from the various sects echoed his sentiments, filled with indignation. Even if Su Yishui had high cultivation, he still could not escape everyone’s wrath.</p>
<p>Back then, Mu Qingge had also been very accomplished, but what happened in the end? Wasn’t she ultimately killed in the siege of the three major sects?</p>
<p>If Su Yishui was confirmed to have incited chaos in the world, he would become the enemy of the righteous path, and everyone would have to eliminate him! Xishan would then be thoroughly discredited, making it difficult for them to rise again!</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu had long anticipated the small-minded schemes of these righteous sects, so when she heard Master Kaiyuan’s words, she knew that her own game plan was half successful. At this moment, she sighed softly and said with a furrowed brow, “Naturally. When it comes to the past, I also bore many insults for Su Yishui… Perhaps you all don’t know? The demon’s son who came out of the Netherworld Realm back then was actually Su Yishui!”</p>
<p><em>What?</em></p>
<p>The faces of all the cultivators of the righteous path changed drastically! Mu Ranwu, as if enduring humiliation for the sake of her wayward disciple, recounted the incident of Su Yishui stealing the Spirit Spring and escaping the Netherworld Realm.</p>
<p>“I always thought he was my disciple, but I failed to teach him well. Instead, I allowed him to develop such ambitions to dominate the world. This was all my fault, so I chose to bear the insults, let everyone misunderstand, and finally sacrificed myself to reform him. But unexpectedly, all my sacrifices were in vain. Su Yishui is still audacious and ambitious, even infiltrating the palace to assassinate the emperor and attempt to defy fate. Before he commits more mistakes, I can only endure the pain of exposing his crimes to prevent everyone from being deceived.”</p>
<p>The elders of the other two major sects listened to this and looked at each other, asking, “Do you have evidence for this?”</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu pretended to sigh, “When you see Su Yishui, you will know that what I say is not false because the Spirit Spring that has been hidden in the mortal world for twenty years is now in him…”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>With these words, everyone became restless and anxious.</p>
<p>The Spirit Spring, such a sinister entity, has always brought great calamity to the world whenever it appeared.</p>
<p>Moreover, thinking back, if Mu Qingge had really conspired with the demon’s son, why had she never used the power of the Spirit Spring?</p>
<p>It was the demon’s son who always wore a mask whenever he appeared, never revealing his true identity.</p>
<p>So what Mu Qingge said could very well be true. Su Yishui had actually deceived the world and hidden his identity as the demon’s son.</p>
<p>At this moment, Wang Suizhi, who was accompanying Mu Ranwu, also spoke up, “Wang’s money banks is spread throughout the land. These years, I have been following Master’s wish to search for the entrance to the Netherworld Realm to return the Spirit Spring. Master entrusted General Qin Xuanjiu to guard the Spirit Spring, but later, it seems that Su Yishui has taken it away. Recently, the revival of the demonic sect, Fantian Sect, is also evident. The world is in danger, and it will rely on all of you to turn the situation around.”</p>
<p>Although this Wang Suizhi didn’t have much cultivation, he relied on his immense wealth to collect ancient cultivation artifacts from all over the world. Moreover, he understood the situation clearly back then and didn’t blame the three major sects for his master’s tragic death.</p>
<p>So the people of the three major sects had dealings with this Wang Suizhi before and accepted his financial support. Now, hearing what he said, many doubts from back then about the sudden disappearance of the demon’s son were suddenly cleared up.</p>
<p>“So Su Yishui has still fallen into the demonic path. Since that’s the case, we cannot tolerate evil and let him harm the people of the world. When dawn comes, I will draft a proclamation to exterminate Su Yishui and his followers on behalf of everyone… Do you all agree?”</p>
<p>After Master Kaiyuan said this, everyone naturally nodded in agreement. However, Qin Xuanjiu had some doubts at this moment. In his view, Su Yishui was indeed despicable, but those disciples he had taken in were innocent, especially Xue Ranran, such a lovely and sincere girl.</p>

<p><br/>If it’s because of Su Yishui that those children have been led astray, and are now also implicated, made Qin Xuanjiu feel somewhat reluctant.</p>
<p>When he tried to intervene, Mu Ranwu smiled and stared at him, saying, “Xuanjiu, when Xue Ranran deliberately framed me at Tianmai Mountain, can’t you see that she’s not kind or innocent? By stopping this, are you aiding the evildoer?”</p>
<p>Listening to the Master’s words, Qin Xuanjiu fell silent. As for Mu Qingge’s other disciples, they had never seen Xue Ranran, so naturally, they wouldn’t intercede for her.</p>
<p>But just as everyone was drafting the proclamation, they suddenly heard someone outside the camp shouting, “Look! They’re back! They’re back!”</p>
<p>Next, the people inside the tent heard the thunderous sound of approaching hooves.</p>
<p>When everyone came out of the tent, they were all stunned.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>In the distance on the plain, there were indeed figures of horses running, but each horse had a rider on it!</p>
<p>The scouts who were shouting realized their mistake and quickly sounded the alarm, changing their call to, “Enemy troops from Gao Kan! Prepare to meet the enemy!”</p>
<p>The righteous cultivators from the three major sects were there to help, and upon hearing this, they immediately took to the sky and formed a defensive formation.</p>
<p>However, as the group of horses approached, they realized something was wrong again. Although there were soldiers from Gao Kan on the horses, they all had dull expressions, seemingly only wearing thin clothes they sleep in and they didn’t even carry weapons while riding all the way here.</p>
<p>At this moment, they were unarmed and didn’t look like they were here for a raid at all!</p>
<p>The one driving the group of horses was a bright-eyed girl with braided hair in a bun.</p>
<p>When the group arrived at the Daqi military camp, the girl jumped down from her horse, stood up neatly, and loudly declared, “Xue Ranran, disciple of Xishan, under the command of the esteemed one, I have come to return the lost warhorses!”</p>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu was the first to step forward and, staring at the girl, exclaimed, “Xue Ranran, what are you up to? Why did you steal the horses first and then return them?”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Xue Ranran had been rather busy with her Shifu all night long.  Elder Jiu had felt that they got along very well, and was quite fond of her at the time. In order to retain this girl who could brew wine, even tempting her by promising to teach her how to make spiritual talismans. So he gave her the bag of talismans with this intention, to let Ranran be impressed about Elder Jiu’s abilities and realize how useful these talismans were.</p>
<p>Of course, there was also half a secret manual of techniques for making spiritual talismans inside. Elder Jiu was quite cunning. Although cultivators could all make talismans, cultivating higher-level talismans was as difficult as reaching the sky. If Xue Ranran only looked at the introductory secrets, it was like eating a plate of appetizing peanuts; without the follow-up fine wine, she would inevitably feel curious and eager to learn the next volume.</p>
<p>When the time comes, he could then poach this obedient and lovely little disciple from Su Yishui, brewing wine and cooking for him every day.</p>
<p>It was fortunate that Elder Jiu had harbored such thoughts and Xue Ranran had long memorized the half-book of talisman-making secrets.</p>
<p>Making talismans was essentially solidifying the spiritual power of cultivators and condensing it onto paper.</p>
<p>With just the half-book with introductory information, she couldn’t make talismans, but she had more than enough knowledge to modify them.</p>
<p>So that night, she sneaked into Gao Kan’s military camp’s stables with Shifu. First, she melted calming elixirs into the horses’ drinking water, calming their spirits. Once the horses were calm, she removed all the talismans from their backs.</p>
<p>Modifying talismans required spiritual water, but Su Yishui said they didn’t have to go through all that trouble. He cut his wrist with a knife and had Ranran use his blood to modify the talismans.</p>
<p>Su Yishui’s blood was now demonic, and incredibly powerful. Although Ranran was just a beginner, she infused hundreds of beast control talismans in the bowl of Su Yishui’s blood, turning them into Troop Maneuvering talismans.</p>
<p>Elder Jiu’s talismans, combined with the blood of the demon’s son, was an incredibly powerful combination.</p>
<p>Because the horses had come rushing over, Gao Kan’s soldiers were gathered together, roasting lamb and celebrating with wine. After pouring the half bowl of blood talismans into the wine vat, those soldiers suddenly widened their eyes. In the later part of the night when everyone was asleep, they stood up straight one by one, went into the stables, climbed onto the horses, grabbed their manes, and rode out of the Gao Kan camp.</p>
<p>When the sentries realized what happened, they sounded the gongs and drums, but it was futile.</p>
<p>So each Gao Kan soldier rode a horse and sent these horses back to the Daqi military camp.</p>
<p>Now that the Gao Kan soldiers had dismounted one by one, they all fell to the ground and fell into a deep sleep. That night, Daqi became the one to effortlessly capture hundreds of Gao Kan soldiers.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Now, upon hearing Qin Xuanjiu’s questioning, Ranran smiled and said, “Misfortune may be a blessing in disguise. I can only say that the talismans on these horses were not placed by Xishan. As for now, these horses have returned with hundreds of prisoners of war intact. General Qin, please investigate thoroughly. We Xishan did not collude with Gao Kan to harm the people of Daqi.”</p>
<p>Just then, disciples from the three major sects also gathered around, coldly snorting, “Pot calling the kettle black, what trickery is Xishan up to?”</p>
<p>Although Ranran was unaware that Elder Mu had come to the Daqi camp to stir up trouble, when she saw Elder Mu standing next to the disciples of the three major sects, acting all friendly, she guessed the general idea.</p>
<p>Elder Mu had colluded with Crimon Gate and must have slandered her Shifu again.</p>
<p>The messy account between her Shifu and Elder Mu was hard to calculate. Xue Ranran only intended to clarify the horse theft incident, so with a clasped fist, she planned to leave.</p>
<p>But disciples from Jiu Hua and Kongshan sects jumped out one after another, blocking her way.</p>
<p>“Female demon, where do you think you’re going? You better confess now, where is the demon’s son Su Yishui hiding?”</p>
<p>Growing up, this was the first time Xue Ranran was bring called a female demon, which she was not accustomed to. But when she heard them calling Su Yi Shui as the demon’s son, she couldn’t help but glare at Elder Mu.</p>
<p>She actually divulged this. Could it be because her Shifu had hurt her feelings, and she planned to exact her revenge?</p>
<p>However, these were also the truth. Ranran felt that her Shifu had indeed been the demon’s son before, and now he does have the Spirit spring. Since there was no need to explain, she didn’t intend to say anything.</p>
<p>In some ways, she should learn from her Shifu and not care too much about what others said, especially the opinions of these negative disciples of the three major sects.</p>
<p>Now that the horses were back and they had subdued the Gao Kan army’s morale, the upcoming battles would be in the secular world, following the will of heaven.</p>
<p>As for the obstruction from the disciples of the three major sects, Ranran was not too bothered. Since the last time her spiritual veins were severed and then reconnected by Su Yishui, she felt that her spiritual power had increased by more than one or two-folds.</p>
<p>However, she didn’t have a chance to compare and wasn’t sure how much she had improved until now, when the disciples of the three major sects blocked her path. With just a wave of her hand, she unexpectedly sent the Jiu Hua disciple flying far away.</p>
<p>Ranran was also startled by this; she didn’t intend to be so heavy-handed. When did the disciples of Jiu Hua become so weak?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Master Kaiyuan felt embarrassed when he saw this.</p>
<p>Since the incident where their top disciples were lost at Tianmai Mountain, Master Kaiyuan had really worked hard to urge his disciples to improve their cultivation. But today, before the people of the three major sects, his top disciple was as fragile as paper, being slapped to the ground.</p>
<p>Master Kaiyuan has always been cunning and crafty. He never acted without absolute certainty. For example, during the battle with Wei Jiu at Jue Mountain, he never made a move, leaving himself a sure way out.</p>
<p>He had also passed the test back then and had entered the Marrow-Refining Pool. Although he wasn’t as outstanding as the younger Mu Qingge or Su Yishui, his nearly two hundred years of foundational cultivation couldn’t be underestimated.</p>
<p>So he didn’t think much of Xue Ranran. Even though she had passed through the Marrow-Refining Pool, she was just a newcomer of the younger generations.</p>
<p>But now Jiu Hua Sect’s dignity was completely lost, and as the leader of the three major sects, the head of the righteous path, Master Kaiyuan had to step forward to regain some respectability.</p>
<p>So seeing Ranran still intending to leave, Master Kaiyuan shook his long robe, and he attacked Ranran directly with his sword.</p>
<p>It had been a long time since the disciples of the three major sects had seen Master Kaiyuan’s skills. But with the spiritual energy of an immortal, containing the aura of a sword, as soon as Master Kaiyuan made a move, one could sense the sword energy moving first, like a cave opening, radiating thousands of beams, making the hair follicles stand up.</p>
<p>Those disciples of Jiu Hua Sect who were good at flattery were already clenching their fists and applauding, “Master, what a move with the Demon-Suppressing Dragon Sword!”</p>
<p>This sword technique was like a rainbow piercing through the clouds, wherever it went, it stirred up the ground, even if Xue Ranran was an outstanding new talent from the Marrow-Refining Pool, what could she do?</p>
<p>Back then, Mu Qingge started losing ground after Master Kaiyuan had pierced her left shoulder with the Ferocious Dragon Sword.</p>
<p>A Daoist Elder who had cultivated for two hundred years could easily teach this unruly little brat a lesson!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran also felt the pressure of Master Kaiyuan’s Sword Qi, which was tens of times stronger than his disciple Wei Fang’s.</p>
<p>But when she leaped and gracefully avoided his fierce strike, she suddenly heard Su Yishui channeling his voice to her: “Old dog Kaiyuan’s weak spot is on the right side of his waist. Aim there more often.”</p>
<p>Su Yishui was familiar with the tactics of the various sect leaders, especially aware of Elder Kaiyuan’s vulnerabilities. He listened to Ranran and didn’t reveal himself in case they evoked his killing intent and he loses control of the Spirit Spring. Instead he used secret messages to give his disciple an advantage, providing her handy cheat notes.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Ranran now had a clear target in mind.</p>
<p>She drew out her mechanism staff with one hand, manipulated her vitality qi in the air, causing the staff to lengthen continuously. It spun and twirled in mid-air before she swung it towards Master Kaiyuan’s waist.</p>
<p>This kind of remote manipulation over a staff was usually mastered by cultivators who had reached the Foundation Establishment stage for a hundred years or more. Yet Ranran, at her young age, had already reached a level of mastery where she could control it effortlessly.</p>
<p>Her attack silenced the surrounding crowd. Everyone looked at this previously unknown girl in astonishment.</p>
<p>Even Master Kaiyuan was taken aback, quickly mobilizing his true qi to defend against the rapidly changing staff that was flying towards him.</p>
<p>What surprised him most was how this little girl seemed to know exactly where his vital points were. She kept targeting his waist with the staff.</p>
<p>Although true qi shields were impenetrable and could withstand even a rain of arrows. But they still had weak points. Master Kaiyuan’s waist was the thinnest part of his true qi, vulnerable to attacks infused with spiritual power.</p>
<p>After a dozen or so exchanges, the agile staff suddenly extended and thrust directly at Master Kaiyuan’s waist.</p>
<p>Master Kaiyuan felt his true qi unable to hold steady, and he cried out in pain. The staff pierced through his true qi shield once again, striking his waist point.</p>
<p>His waist had been severely injured during the siege of Mu Qingge. A shard from the explosion of Mu Qingge’s divine artifact had embedded itself there, leaving lingering effects even after healing.</p>
<p>Now, this little girl seemed to know exactly where his weaknesses lay, attacking his vital points relentlessly. How could he defend against her?</p>
<p>But Master Kaiyuan was not one to be trifled with. Sensing that his vulnerabilities had been exposed, he quickly reached for his waist.</p>
<p>At that moment, Ranran heard Su Yishui’s voice again: “He’s going to use the Heavenly Bell Artifact. Retreat quickly and avoid further confrontation.”</p>
<p>The Heavenly Bell was an artifact left behind by the powerful Dun Tian. </p>
<p>Legend had it that Dun Tian’s inner demons were difficult to suppress. So, he refined a bell from the cold iron of the Snow Mountain. It was hung above his head every day. When the demons in his hearts arose, preventing him from meditating in peace, the bell would ring incessantly, emitting a chilling aura to dispel the demonic agitation.</p>
<p>Although Ranran’s cultivation had advanced rapidly, her experience in actual combat was still very limited. If the chilling aura of the Heavenly Bell invaded her body, it would surely cause damage. So Su Yishui told her to retreat quickly.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>With this proactive retreat, Master Kaiyuan was given some room to gracefully step down from the fight.</p>
<p>He realized that this battle was not without uncertainties. Although he probaly wouldn’t be defeated, victory might be hard-won and embarrassing. So while the girl retreated, he quickly said coldly, “You’re just a new young disciple in the sect. If I were to kill you now, it would seem heartless on our part. Go back and tell your master, if you don’t want to stray into the wrong path, it’s better to hand over the Spirit Spring soon.”</p>
<p>Ranran actually replied with sincerity, “Please rest assured. Our Xishan Sect has always avoided worldly conflicts. As of now, the Spirit Spring couldn’t be sent back to the Netherworld Realm yet. My master fears its influence on the world and unfortunately lacks a suitable artifact to seal it. He can only temporarily seal it within his body. Of course, if among you there are powerful and virtuous seniors capable of sealing the Spirit Spring, my master is willing to yield and pass this thankless task back to you.”</p>
<p>If Ranran had said this before her battle with Master Kaiyuan, it would have surely drawn ridicule. </p>
<p>What was Su Yishui, who had once given his cultivated core to water the Rebirth tree, even worth? Back then, during the confrontation with Wei Jiu at Jue Mountain, he had embarrassingly admitted openly that he was no match for Wei Jiu.</p>
<p>But now, a new female disciple of Su Yishui could confront the sect leader of Jiuhua without falling behind, even making the usually composed Master Kaiyuan scream like a slaughtered pig. How shocking was this display of strength?</p>
<p>Therefore, although her words sounded grating and rather sarcastic, every sentence was true, making it even more embarrassing.</p>
<p>When Mu Qingge said that Su Yishui was hiding the Spirit Spring, they were still somewhat doubtful. But now, the young girl claimed that Su Yishui was not controlled by the Spirit Spring but had sealed it within his body. This terrifying hidden strength simply stunned everyone.</p>
<p>At this moment, someone else shouted, “Putting aside the lost horses incident for now, but your master caused a huge disturbance in the palace. It is indisputable fact that he had used an evil dragon to assassinate the emperor. The palace suffered numerous collapses! If you’re not harboring malicious intentions, why would such a thing happen?”</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t really feel like engaging with these righteous people who easily believe in rumors and are all too ready to frame their Xishan sect.</p>
<p>“The palace has been raising that dragon privately for over a decade. I believe fellow daoists here have acquaintances in the Yiren Hall in the Capital. Just make a little effort to inquire, and you’ll know the truth. There’s a high-ranking figure in the palace who’s been secretly raising the dragon, even using people to feed it, all in an attempt to prolong life with dragon’s qi. However, that dragon’s malevolent nature is hard to control. Shifu had feared it would destroy the Capital and cause suffering to the populace, so he secretly entered the palace and sent the dragon back to Dragon Island. If Xishan is falsely accused of such matters, then either you’re feigning ignorance or truly malicious.”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>At this point, Ranran put two fingers into her mouth and made a loud whistle. A fiery red vermilion bird flew out from the distant woods. Ranran lightly stepped on her toes, gracefully leaped onto the vermilion bird’s back. Facing everyone, especially that Mu Qingge, she said meaningfully, “Cultivation is not easy; it requires maintaining a pure heart at all times. If we look back, in nearly two hundred years, only the Medicine Immortal has ascended among the great cultivators. It seems like many of you are stuck at a certain bottleneck. If you can let go of past grudges, be less competitive, refrain from hasty judgments of others, perhaps your path to ascension will be smoother.”</p>
<p>After saying this, the Vermilion Bird let out a long cry, swirled in the air with its long tail, then flew away into the distance with Xue Ranran…</p>
<p>Although many people had seen Ranran riding the Vermilion Bird before at the foot of the Tianmai Mountain, this time, they were still captivated by the dazzling divine light of the Vermilion Bird.</p>
<p>The Vermilion Bird is different from other divine beasts; it is a sacred and pure entity that wouldn’t form a soul contract with anyone. Only the purest souls could tame it.</p>
<p>The fact that it willingly let Xue Ranran ride, it was in itself a testament to the young girl’s character.</p>
<p>If it were an evil entity, the Vermilion Bird would rather turn into goo and perish together, than willingly debase itself by being ridden by someone malicious.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As they watched Xue Ranran riding the Vermilion Bird and disappearing into the distance, the lingering glow had yet to dissipate. Even if someone wanted to save some dignity by calling her a female demon, they were too flustered to speak.</p>
<p>At that moment, several disciples beside Mu Qingge spoke up, “The young girl named Ranran makes sense. Perhaps we’ve misunderstood…”</p>
<p>Before they could finish speaking, Mu Qingge shot them a sharp look and coldly said, “The appearance of Spirit Spring in the mortal realm heralds great chaos. Su Yishui caused me great suffering in my past life. Do you think he’s changed for the better in just twenty years?”</p>
<p>Master Kaiyuan was still suffering from the excruciating pain in his waist, but he maintained his composure to uphold the authority of the sect. Upon hearing Mu Qingge’s words, he immediately followed with, “The Spirit Spring is of great importance; we cannot let a mere little girl talk nonsense without proof. If what she said is true, it is still inappropriate to leave the Spirit Spring solely in Su Yishui’s care. We, as well as other major sects, need to supervise him and ensure that the Spirit spring is returned to the Netherworld Realm!”</p>
<p>However, each of the three major sects had their own agendas.</p>
<p>Wen Chunhui from the Kongshan Sect clasped her fists and said, “Everyone, the ongoing conflict between Da Qi and Gao Kan is part of worldly fate. The incident with the horses driven by spirit charms serves as a warning. If we cultivators meddle in such mundane matters, we may inadvertently defy fate and bring unforeseen calamities upon ourselves. Now that the horses have been returned, this matter is settled. Our Kongshan Sect has many female disciples; it’s not suitable for us to linger in the military camp. We shall bid farewell first.”</p>
<p>With that, she flicked her horse’s tail whisk and led her female disciples away without looking back.</p>
<p>This newly appointed Elder Wen was not a fool; she originally didn’t want to come here. It’s just that they had to consider Master Kaiyuan’s reputation, she had to come and go through the motions.</p>
<p>Earlier, when Mu Qingge had shifted all the blame onto the deceased Wen Hongshan, it made her very displeased.</p>
<p>And the words that the young girl said before leaving, were even more enlightening for her.</p>
<p>Indeed, how many great talents did the Kongshan Sect produce in the past? But why have they now fallen into such a decline?</p>
<p>Upon careful consideration, this decline seems to have started irreversibly since the siege of Mu Qingge.</p>
<p>The rules of the Kongshan Sect have always been about maintaining a pure heart and few desires, not getting involved in worldly disputes. Unfortunately, the former sect leader, Abbess Wen, and Wen Hongshan have all gone astray, leading the disciples to follow Jiuhua Sect and engage in improper worldly affairs.</p>
<p>If the matter with the Spirit Spring is true, it will certainly be another catastrophe. The foundation of the Kongshan Sect is too weak now, and the disciples are not yet mature; they really can’t withstand turmoil.</p>
<p>Since Master Kaiyuan has a face full of righteousness and that Mu Qingge has a self-sacrificing demeanor, then let them go ahead and save the world.</p>
<p>What she wants is to hurry back to Kongshan, refine more elixirs; if the world falls into chaos, the sect’s gates must be shut even tighter. They cannot keep following Master Kaiyuan recklessly.</p>
<p>On the side, the Elder of the Feiyun Sect is not a fool either. Among the three major sects, the Feiyun Sect was the weakest in terms of strength. Seeing the Kongshan Sect leave in the night, they too used the excuse that their sect leader has summoned their members back for urgent matters. After hastily bidding farewell to Master Kaiyuan, who was clutching his waist, they quickly left as well.</p>
<p>Now, most of the grand momentum of the Righteous Alliance had dissipated, leaving only some lesser-known sects staring at each other, silently contemplating how to leave gracefully without offending Elder Kaiyuan.</p>
<p>In a moment, the offensive launched by the Jiuhua Sect against Xishan had largely subsided.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Mu Qingge also knew that these remaining groups couldn’t produce any substantial outcome. She elegantly asked Master Kaiyuan to devise a plan and inform her, then led her disciples to leave.</p>
<p>She couldn’t reveal to these disciples her secret assistance to Gao Kan. Therefore, she currently resided openly in Wuma Town.</p>
<p>She had thought that with the three major sects leading the charge, they would incite everyone to attack Xishan like they did in her previous life. However, she never expected that Xue Ranran could retrieve those runaway horses and gain the upper hand in the confrontation with Master Kaiyuan.</p>
<p>In the world of cultivation, besides the labels of righteousness and evil, one’s strength spoke volumes. Now that Xue Ranran, a junior disciple of Xishan, had shown her prowess, it was enough to intimidate everyone.</p>
<p>And if the disciple was like this, the master possessed by the Spirit Spring would be unimaginably powerful!</p>
<p>So while exterminating demons and evil was the right path in the mortal world, blindly rushing forward without considering such vast discrepancies in power would be foolish.</p>
<p>At present, almost no one was willing to be a fool. All of Mu Ranwu’s efforts were clearly in vain.</p>
<p>Thinking about how Gaokan had lost so many soldiers as prisoners this time, she felt it would be difficult to explain to Prince Yiling. Mu Ranwu sighed deeply in frustration.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">惯会做人   BEING A GOOD GUY</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>She glanced at Wang Suizhi beside her. He had been looking thoughtful ever since he saw Xue Ranran fighting Master Kaiyuan earlier.</p>
<p>She suspected he might have noticed something amiss, so on the way back to Wuma Town, she asked, “Xiao Zhi, what are you thinking about?”</p>
<p>Wang Suizhi was no longer the dashing youth of years past, but being called “Xiao Zhi” by his master, he quickly responded, “Just now, I saw the stick that Xue Ranran used. It’s exquisitely crafted… not like ordinary objects, more like the craftsmanship of Old Fourteen.”</p>
<p>Old Fourteen? Mu Ranwu immediately recalled the renowned artisan Zeng Yi. Indeed, he possessed extraordinary skills in crafting; his hands seemed connected to the divine…</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu’s eyes lit up. It would be a pity not to recruit such a talented individual under her banner, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p>She tentatively asked, “Do you know what happened to Zeng Yi?”</p>
<p>Wang Suizhi shook his head, somewhat regretful, and said, “Back then, he was arrogant because of his talent and didn’t get along well with us. Later, when Xishan disbanded, he disappeared without a trace. He never came to find us afterward… Oh, that…isn’t that Old Fourteen?”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As the two were talking, Wang Suizhi, at the market on the border town, actually spotted Zeng Yi who had just gotten off a carriage.</p>
<p>After the incident with the Horse Trading Post, the shopkeeper and his assistants had been captured and not released. The others in the shop had no choice but to send a letter by pigeon to Zeng Yi, asking the boss to handle it.</p>
<p>Zeng Yi wasn’t too far from Wuma Town at the time. Since the incident in the Capital, he had not been able to reach Su Yi Shui and the others, nor did he know about Ranran’s recent situation.</p>
<p>Finally after receiving a letter from Su Yishui, saying he was coming to the border, Zeng Yi brought Bai Baishan and a few servants, hurrying all the way.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, as soon as he arrived, he encountered an old acquaintance before he could even settle down.</p>
<p>When Third Senior Brother Wang Suizhi suddenly appeared in front of him and called out his name, Zeng Yi couldn’t help but be stunned.</p>
<p>“Old Fourteen, you’re hiding here. Do you know how long I’ve been looking for you?” </p>
<p>Zeng Yi quietly glanced at the woman beside Wang Suizhi, who was wearing a veiled hat and said with a smile, “Yes, Third Senior Brother, long time no see. And this is…?”</p>
<p>At that moment, Mu Ranwu lifted her veil, revealing a face strikingly similar to Mu Qingge from her past life. “Yi’er, it’s me…”</p>
<p>This face had a powerful effect on Mu Qingge’s disciples, bringing tears to their eyes. As Mu Ranwu waited for Zeng Yi to cry and rush over to acknowledge her as his master, Zeng Yi instead hesitated and said, “You’re… my Master?”</p>
<p>Wang Suizhi smiled and said, “Of course, your Master. Don’t you know that your esteemed teacher has been reincarnated on the Rebirth Tree?”</p>
<p>Zeng Yi collected himself and then respectfully greeted Mu Qingge, but there was no warmth in his words.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu, recalling Wang Suizhi’s words about Xue Ranran’s mechanical staff possibly being made by Zeng Yi and sensing his lack of enthusiasm, tentatively asked, “Yi’er, it seems like you don’t want to see old acquaintances again?”</p>
<p>Wang Suizhi also hit his shoulder and said, “What’s wrong with you? Could it be that you’ve become obsessed with making weapons and don’t even recognize your Master anymore?”</p>
<p>Zeng Yi smiled wryly and said, “Of course not. It’s just that I’m now running a small business to make a living and no longer think about cultivating immortality. If you two have no other business, then I’ll take my leave.”</p>
<p>However, Wang Suizhi stopped him with a hand and smiled coldly, “Master had been generous to you in the past, yet you treat her like this? Could it be that you’ve joined forces with Su Yishui? Is the staff in his female disciple’s hand made by you? I recognized it at a glance… AH…”</p>
<p>Before he could finish his words, he was startled by Zeng Yi who suddenly raised his hand.</p>
<p>On those bare hands, there wasn’t a single finger, which gave Wang Suizhi a start.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu also frowned and took a step back. “What happened to your hands?”</p>
<p>Zeng Yi explained, “When I was young and reckless, I offended someone, so both my hands were crippled. Now I run a small business, managing hot springs and horse trading, just to make ends meet. I’m just an ordinary person, not adept at cultivating. If you two have no business with me, I’ll take my leave.”</p>
<p>Wang Suizhi felt somewhat ashamed. Fourteen’s hands had seemed disabled for a long time. How could he have made weapons for Su Yishui’s disciple? It seemed that he had misunderstood Fourteen.</p>
<p>Zeng Yi was originally someone was very proud of his talent. Now that he had become disabled, it was understandable that he felt ashamed to meet old acquaintances and didn’t want to recall past events. If Wang Suizhi had known about his difficulties earlier, he would have surely helped this junior brother…</p>
<p>Thinking about everyone, including himself, who had left Xishan for a long time and faced their own difficulties, he felt quite emotional.</p>
<p>However, when Mu Ranwu looked at Zeng Yi’s hurried departure, she only seemed somewhat disappointed, with a hint of regret. “Different paths lead to different destinations. Since his hands are disabled and he doesn’t want to stay in contact with us, let him go his own way.”</p>
<p>What a pity for Zeng Yi’s genius in crafting, but since he had become useless, keeping him around would serve no purpose. Mu Ranwu never was one to waste effort on people or matters that didn’t benefit her.</p>
<p>As she turned away, she didn’t see the brief surprise on Wang Suizhi’s face. Wang Suizhi was a businessman and naturally adept at social interactions.</p>
<p>However, he never expected that after Master found out about Fourteen’s appalling experience, she would be so indifferent, as if she had only heard a story…</p>
<p>Could it be that the Rebirth Tree had made the once chivalrous and kind-hearted Master become cold-hearted?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As for Zeng Yi, meeting this imposter so unexpectedly also gave him a start. But he couldn’t directly expose her identity to his former senior brothers.</p>
<p>Hating that Master’s identity couldn’t be revealed to the world yet. Recalling the words spoken by Su Yishui when he guided her soul to the tree, Zeng Yi knew that in this life, the Master must not become Mu Qingge again.</p>
<p>Changing heaven’s will and destiny always came at a price. Back then, what Master changed was the fate of Emperors! </p>
<p>Now, with the premature fall of the spirit fruit from the tree, changing her birth date and eight characters, having all her spiritual energy *taken over by someone else, Zeng Yi didn’t know if she could escape divine punishment……</p>
<p>There weren’t many people left to protect Master now. But even if he had to sacrifice everything, he would definitely protect Master’s well-being!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Inside Wuma Town, this encounter between master and disciple seemed to have ended without resolution. Back to Ranran, riding the Vermilion Bird, arrived at the foot of the mountain and landed lightly.</p>
<p>She saw Su Yishui who had arrived first, sitting on a large rock, swinging the lantern she had punctured…</p>
<p>Actually, Ranran didn’t know what had gotten into her at that moment. She was angry and had impulsively pierced the lantern. Now, seeing Shifu looking at the punctured painting on the lantern, Ranran felt somewhat apologetic.</p>
<p>Between Shifu and Elder Mu, whether it was grudges or love affairs, it was their business. Did she have any right to lose her temper and damage the lantern that Shifu had worked so hard on?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, she hesitantly approached, took out her snack bag, and handed it to the man. “Eat some, it might improve your mood… um…do you want me to go to town and buy you a lantern?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui tilted his head and glanced at her guilty expression, said expressionlessly, “I don’t want something bought; you have to make it yourself.”</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t know how to make it, but placating Shifu was like placating a child—agree first, figure it out later.</p>
<p>So, after Ranran fed him three candied plums, the demon’s son Su Yishui, was at last in a slightly better mood.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Thus, the two returned to their campsite, now bright with the morning light of the next day.</p>
<p>As they returned, they happened to see Yutong just coming back from the rear mountains. With  dew abundant in the mountains, her clothes were marked with water, showing she had been standing in the wild grass for quite some time. Or was it that she hadn’t seen her and Shifu for a while, prompting her to go search?</p>
<p>Indeed, upon seeing them, Yutong asked, “Master, where did you two go?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui replied nonchalantly, “Was there anything unusual last night?”</p>
<p>Yutong paused, not understanding. “Did something happen?”</p>
<p>Ranran couldn’t help but glance at second uncle master. Since their return from the sea island, everyone else was fine, but second uncle master had been absent-minded often. She recalled seeing her shed tears secretly before.</p>
<p>With the grand commotion last night, even sound sleepers would have been awakened by the sound of hooves. Yet second uncle master seemed clueless, clearly having left early yesterday and only returning just now.</p>
<p>Ranran was about to speak, but Shifu suddenly reached out and grabbed Yutong’s neck.</p>
<p>Alarmed, Ranran thought Shifu’s demonic nature had flared up again. Yutong, however, didn’t evade or resist, allowing Su Yishui to snap her neck, her face actually showing a sense of relief.</p>
<p>Just as Ranran was about to intervene, she noticed something odd—Su Yishui seemed to be channeling his spiritual power forcibly into Yutong’s body.</p>
<p>Su Yishui’s current spiritual power, was tinged with demonic energy, and surged like turbulent waves. Though Yutong had some foundation in Qi cultivation, she couldn’t withstand it. Soon, her meridians bulged, and something resembling an egg protruded from her abdomen to her throat.</p>
<p>At that moment, Su Yishui released his grip and Yutong collapsed to the ground, retching until she finally expelled something like a golden-shelled beetle.</p>
<p>Ranran was startled. She had initially thought it was an Immortal Devouring bug, but it seemed different, being bulky and unable to fly.</p>
<p>She raised her foot to step on it, but Su Yishui stopped her. He stooped down and scooped it into his water pouch, sealing it before tossing it into a distant mountain stream.</p>
<p>“That thing is poisonous; do not touch it. Now, if you have something difficult to say, you can say it,” Su Yishui finally spoke.</p>
<p>Yutong fell to her knees, tears already streaming down her face. “Master, my son was taken by Su Yu’s men. I never intended to betray you… If not for worrying about my son, I would have died for my sins long ago.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Yuchen, Gaocang, and Qiu Xier have heard the commotion and arrived as well. Seeing this scene, they were stunned.</p>
<p>It turned out that Su Yu somehow learned about Yutong’s family in the town below Western Mountain.</p>
<p>Just before they set off for the Capital, they sent people to capture her lover and son. But Yutong was unaware until later, when she found out, they already had leverage over her.</p>
<p>Later, Su Yu’s men located Yutong and forced her to swallow this Heart-Devouring Worm.</p>
<p>This worm not only could release poison but also transmitted sound and sensations, a genuine eavesdropping insect.</p>
<p>In other words, everything Yutong saw or heard would be transmitted intact to Old Feng, who controlled the worm.</p>
<p>If Yutong dared to reveal anything, they would immediately kill her son and her lover.</p>
<p>Although Yutong intended to sever worldly ties eventually, but it would be done knowing that these two are safe and sound, doing well.</p>
<p>Now, trapped in such a situation, although Yutong was loyal to Master, she didn’t know how to choose. If she spoke directly to Master, Old Feng would know immediately and likely harm her son. But if she left and refused to be Su Yu’s informant, Su Yu still wouldn’t spare her son and lover either.</p>
<p>Thus, Yutong could only try to avoid conversing or mingling during meals, even deliberately avoiding gatherings at night, to prevent any important information pertaining to the Spirit Spring from reaching Su Yu.</p>
<p>Last night was no exception. She ran to the rear mountains, cried her heart out, hence missing the exciting stampede of horses.</p>
<p>Here, the terrain was peculiar, a natural barrier. When circling to the rear mountains, all sounds, including the sound of hooves, were muffled, so she didn’t know what happened last night.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran, hearing this, finally understood. She asked in a small voice, “Did you leak the incident about Shifu possessing the White Tiger?”</p>
<p>Yutong nodded in shame, then shook her head. “It should have been when I was chatting casually with Xu Lang before, and mentioned it in passing. Little did I know Su Yu would scheme like this, exploiting that and nearly endangering Master…”</p>
<p>Xu Lang was her lover from the town below. Who would have thought these words would indirectly reach Su Yu’s ears!</p>
<p>Curious, Ranran asked how Shifu had discovered the eavesdropping insect in second uncle master’s belly.</p>
<p>Su Yishui explained, “By right, it couldn’t be discovered. But these past days, she hasn’t eaten, but the worm in her belly is a greedy one. Due to her stagnant Qi, just now, I heard the insect’s noise…”</p>
<p>Ranran understood then.</p>
<p>Yuchen was enraged, stomping his feet and yelling at his sister, “I told you before, since you serve Master, how could you secretly start a family down the mountain? Now look, you’ve given them leverage, letting others control you and even committing treason! You, you…”</p>
<p>As he spoke, he suddenly pulled out a dagger, pulled open his clothes to reveal his chest, and cried, “My sister has done unforgivable things which is her elder brother’s fault. I can only repent with death. I beg Master to spare my unfortunate sister…”</p>
<p>Saying this, he thrust the knife towards his chest. But Yutong flew over, trying to grab the knife to kill herself. For a moment, the siblings struggled, both vying for death, making for a lively scene.</p>
<p>Ranran went up and snatched the dagger away, tossing it far down into the ravine. Then she took a deep breath and said, “Who’s right and who’s wrong can be discussed later. Su Yu has people in his hands, and that child is only six years old. He might be terribly frightened now, still waiting for his mother and uncle to rescue him. If both of you die, are you going to let Shifu handle this task?”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>In Western Mountain, the weight of little junior sister’s words was second only to the Master’s.</p>
<p>With her command, everyone began searching for the waterskin pouch. Su Yishui’s strength was too much, and thrown it too far, they nearly lost it for good.</p>
<p>However, the little bug seemed to be at its last breath. When poured out of the water bottle, it flapped its wings a few times before it just died.</p>
<p>Yutong knew that if the bug died, it would surely reveal that things had gone wrong to the other side. Thinking that the father and son might lose their lives because of her, she felt a surge of sadness and grabbed the dead bug, intending to swallow it.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier, watching this, covered her mouth and retched, feeling like she could skip today’s meals again, so she could still lose more weight.</p>
<p>Finally snatching the dead bug from her, they heard someone shouting loudly at the foot of the mountain, “By His Majesty’s decree, Miss Xue Ranran is requested to receive the edict!”</p>
<p>The ones from Xishan glanced at each other. They hadn’t expected that as soon as the bug died, someone would arrive so quickly.</p>
<p>When Xue Ranran descended the mountain, she saw several palace attendants under the escort of Daqi guards, holding a sealed yellow-lettered message.</p>
<p>The letter was personally written by Su Yu to Xue Ranran.</p>
<p>He seemed to have anticipated that the bug would be discovered by Su Yishui. In the letter, he apologized on behalf of Lao Feng, attributing the incident to Lao Feng’s unauthorized actions. He mentioned that the child and the scholar had been brought to Wuma Town and have been settled in a courtyard.</p>
<p>Such understanding words made it seem like a genuine misunderstanding.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>By the side, Su Yi Shui had a faint redness in his eyes.</p>
<p>It would seem that Xiao Yu was still good at playing people. Knowing Ranran’s birth secret, he wanted to appear as the good guy in front of her.</p>
<p>Using a child to coerce his mother was an utterly shameless act, and there was no good way to put it.</p>
<p>If Su Yishui hadn’t discovered the bug and this goodwill letter had arrived earlier, it would have seemed like Su Yu had discovered his subordinates acting inappropriately and took the initiative to admit it. The Emperor would have appeared as an honest and upright man before Xue Ranran…</p>
<p>This desperate attempt to please and ingratiate oneself was truly admirable! In her past life, “Xiao Yu” had gained Mu Qingge’s trust step by step this way, gradually alienating him…</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he couldn’t help but grab Ranran’s slender arm firmly. Ranran, sensing his demonic nature resurging, though unsure of the reason, reached back and held his arm, saying softly, “Uncle Master Zeng Yi should have arrived at Wuma Town. If Shifu is worried about deception, we can ask Uncle Master Zeng to send someone to verify first.”</p>
<p>As her hand rested on his, the faint redness in Su Yishui’s eyes gradually dissipated.</p>
<p>Since their whereabouts were now known, staying on the mountain was useless. They might as well return to town.</p>
<p>The eunuch smiled at Xue Ranran and continued, “When His Majesty was unconscious, some subordinates didn’t understand the situation and even put your portraits on wanted posters. His Majesty is much better now and has ordered your portraits, along with those of the other immortal masters, to be taken down. Please rest assured and go ahead to town.”</p>
<p>After delivering the message, the eunuch instructed the others to descend the mountain.</p>
<p>Hearing that the emperor had ordered the release of her son and Yu lang, Yutong was eager to descend immediately.</p>
<p>However, Su Yu was a cunning one, so they still waited a day to gather information, before returning to Wuma Town at last. Gao Cang and Qiu Xier went to the notice board and confirmed that their wanted posters were gone.</p>
<p>The incident of the horses had also been clarified, so the employees from the Horse Trading Post were also released.</p>
<p>Zeng Yi stood at the entrance of the Horse Trading Post to welcome Ranran. The son of the second uncle master and the scholar Zhao Xuan were brought over by her.</p>
<p>After Su Yishui checked their vitals and confirmed they were not poisoned, the second uncle master hugged her somewhat emaciated son in tears.</p>
<p>And so the warm bedding and the braised pork finally fell into place after a series of ups and downs.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>While Ranran and third senior sister went to take a hot bath, Zeng Yi and Su Yishui had a private conversation.</p>
<p>“After Su Yu made such a big fuss, why did he act so kindly all of a sudden?” Zeng Yi had already planned to shut down all his businesses and follow Xue Ranran and the others in exile, roaming the world, but unexpectedly, things took a turn.</p>
<p>When he finished asking, not hearing a reply from Su Yishui, he turned to look and saw him sitting cross-legged there, hands clenched. Although his expression was calm, the veins on his arms were bulging, obviously silently resisting the sudden resurgence of his demonic nature.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Zeng Yi sighed slightly, took out a string of transparent glass prayer beads from his pocket, and handed them to Su Yishui. “These are the calming beads that Master begged from the  Tower of Eternal Life when you fell into demonic tendencies back then. Wear them close to your body to alleviate some of the demonic nature. Unfortunately, I didn’t have the chance to give them to you before, so I held onto them. Now they can be of use again…”</p>
<p>Before he could finish his sentence, Su Yishui snatched the glass prayer beads away. When he put them on his wrist, a refreshing chill came, and indeed, the demonic nature slightly diminished.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing difficult to understand about what he’s doing. He must know that the Spirit Spring is in my possession. For the safety of the mortal realm, he can’t wait for me to find the entrance to the Netherworld realm quickly and return it. Moreover, he hasn’t died yet; someone must have given him some temporary relief, but to completely rid himself of the ailment and pain, he needs to visit the Netherworld realm. So, until we find the entrance to it, we’re temporarily safe.”</p>
<p>After calming his restless thoughts, Su Yishui explained slowly.</p>
<p>Zeng Yi nodded, sighing, “I know you’ve always resented Master for altering your fate. But you should also understand, if it weren’t for Master changing your destiny back then, even if everything had gone according to your wishes, what would have been the outcome…”</p>
<p>Su Yishui didn’t speak. He stood up and went to the window, where he could see the backyard of the horse trading post. Two girls who had just finished bathing were in the yard, looking at a newly born foal.</p>
<p>The young girl with slightly damp long hair was smiling exceptionally dazzling as she stroked the foal’s mane.</p>
<p>Su Yishui calmly touched the prayer beads on his wrist. Only he knew that he did indeed resent her, initially because she altered his destiny. But later on, he realized that his resentment towards her was just a little too much… What exactly was mixed into this resentment, only he himself knew…</p>
<p>Zeng Yi had gotten used to Su Yishui not responding. He thought he had hit the mark on Su Yishui’s thoughts and sighed before continuing, “Although you helped Master be reborn, you cannot bear the divine punishment for her. But when Master fell back then, she was not yet ripe, and we don’t know if altering her birthdate would be beneficial to her…”</p>
<p>This time, Su Yishui finally spoke, “I won’t let anything happen to her…”</p>
<p>Assured, Zeng Yi nodded, “When I arrived in town, I saw that Elder Mu, and the former senior brothers were all around her. Her deception will eventually dishonor Master’s name… What do you think, should we tell them the truth to prevent them from being deceived?”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>
<p><em>So I guess the timeline is correct.</em></p>
<p><em>In Chapter 59, Ranran and Xier were washing the meat by the stream, and it sounded like they were still camping out? So it was their last night in the mountains before they moved back to town.</em></p>
<p><em>The night Ranran went to watch fireflies with Su Yishui and poked the lantern, they then solved all of Xishan’s problems in that same night.<br/>After returning the horses, she fought with Master Kaiyuan ( still that long night ) and succeeded in dispersing all the righteous sects ( still night lol ) gathered to wipe out Xishan and foiling Mu Ranwu’s evil plot.</em></p>
<p><em>The next morning, they found out about Yutong’s situation but Su Yu then proceeded to remove their wanted status. </em></p>
<p><em>They only went back to Wu Ma town the next day, since they opted to wait a day.</em></p>
<p><em>So I guess they had braised pork two nights in a row, one in the mountains and once when they all had a reunion dinner back in town.</em></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">各怀心事   EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN THOUGHTS </h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Su Yi Shui replied coldly without hesitation, “No need. She is not Mu Qingge anymore, and she does not need any disciples to burden her. She has done enough for them in the past. If they are blind enough to insist on recognizing an imposter as their master, then they only have themselves to blame! As for that imposter, I promised Mu Qingge that I wouldn’t harm her sister’s life. I cannot break that oath. But if Mu Ranwu seeks her own demise, no one can stop her.”</p>
<p>Zeng Yi hadn’t seen Su Yishui so scathing in a long time.</p>
<p>He had thought that time had healed the once solitary, arrogant and extreme young man. But now, possessed by the Spirit Spring, he once again realized that Su Yishui’s heart was still so cynical and contemptuous, difficult to get along with.</p>
<p>Thinking that he had actually taken on three other disciples in addition to Ranran, it all seemed so inconceivable. He remembered asking Su Yishui the reason for accepting disciples.</p>
<p>Naturally, Su Yishui’s answer wasn’t about spreading knowledge, or passing on the immortal heritage. It was because if Ranran was the only young person on the mountain, he feared that she would feel lonely and out of place when she had to leave her parents behind.</p>
<p>After all, she had always been fond of making friends, in this life and the previous one.</p>
<p>Thinking of their fellow disciples who are around the imposter now, Zeng Yi sighed silently. But Su Yishui was right. In her past life, Master had taken on too many burdens, and he didn’t want her to still be so exhausted in this life, always giving to others…</p>
<p>He would have to find a chance to hint to those who have gone to the imposter. He could only hope that they wouldn’t remain blind for too long and would soon recognize what were the differences in their master.</p>
<p>As Zeng Yi sighed, Ranran’s little face appeared at the window, and she called out to the two inside with a smile, “Shifu, Uncle Master, it’s time for dinner! I stewed the braised pork before taking a bath, and it’s ready now. Third senior sister also picked some greens from the backyard to wrap the meat with, which is perfect for alleviating greasiness!”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Since the disciples of Xishan had not yet become immortals, they were quite indulgent in their appetites. Even though they had not feared the authorities’ pursuit as wanted criminals, they still stayed hidden in the mountains to avoid unnecessary trouble. Finally, they could sit down peacefully at a table for a meal.</p>
<p>The dishes on the table were plentiful. Besides Ranran’s braised pork, there was also locally famous roasted lamb leg, along with sweet onion scrambled eggs.</p>
<p>Uncle Zeng Yi felt it was inappropriate to use his feet at the dinner table with everyone, so he had his specially made spoon fitted onto his palm to eat.</p>
<p>The second senior brother, who came with Uncle Zeng Yi, kept glancing around at the dinner table.</p>
<p>Regarding second uncle master’s coerced betrayal of Shifu, Bai Baishan was actually rather pleased. If that were the case, he won’t be the only wayward disciple in Xishan. If Shifu didn’t punish the second uncle master, does it mean that his return to the sect might be imminent?</p>
<p>Now that his feet skills were considerable, and he wanted Shifu to see his efforts, during the meal, without saying a word, Bai Baishan took off his shoes and stretched out his legs, using chopsticks to pick up the biggest piece of meat in the bowl.</p>
<p>But his way of eating was quite unwelcome. He had barely picked up one bite with his chopsticks when Qiu xier and Gaocang pushed him off the table together.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier warned the second senior brother in a low voice, she was saving his life—Shifu’s temper was volatile now, and if the second senior brother dared to eat like that, he should be prepared for his legs to be broken.</p>
<p>The second senior brother felt a chill after hearing this. He put on his shoes again, eating his meal properly with his hands.</p>
<p>The little son of Yutong, named Nuo Er, sat next to his mother, eating with a oily shiny mouth and eyes lighting up, praising Sister Xue’s cooking skills.</p>
<p>While everyone was happily dining together, the distant outskirts of the town rang out with the sound of horns. It seemed that Daqi and Gao Kan had started fighting.</p>
<p>This inevitable battle was looming, and with the sound of distant horses’ hooves, the food on the table seemed less appetizing. So, after hastily finishing the meal, everyone went back to their rooms to rest.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>At night, hearing the distant rumbling, Ranran couldn’t sleep peacefully. Suddenly, she thought she heard some movement next door, so she looked at Qiu Xier sleeping soundly beside her, carefully got up, put on her clothes, and walked out of the horse post.</p>
<p>At this time, during the ongoing battle, the city was under curfew. But Ranran didn’t intend to walk on the streets anyway; instead, she chose a secluded spot on the city wall and leaped lightly up.</p>
<p>Sure enough, sitting on the city wall was a familiar figure. Ranran walked over and sat beside him, whispering, “Shifu, the winds are cold at night, be careful of the chill…”</p>
<p>While speaking, Ranran suddenly noticed that Shifu had seemed to lift his sleeve and look at his arm earlier. Although he quickly put it back down, she still saw the black-line-like blood vessels bulging on his hand—signs of Spirit Spring’s demonic spread…</p>
<p>After Su Yishui covered his sleeve, he turned to look at her and said lightly, “The lonely moon in the desert is not something you can see anywhere else…”</p>
<p>Ranran followed his gaze and indeed saw the moonlight pouring down. The desert was like snow, this was different from the scenery in the mountains.</p>
<p>She suddenly thought, on this wall, who else had Shifu moon-gazed with?</p>
<p>Thinking of Elder Mu’s increasingly arrogant behavior, Ranran felt it necessary to have a talk with Shifu.</p>
<p>When she was in the military camp, it was entirely out of consideration for the old friendship between Elder Mu and her Shifu, that she endured without exposing her collusion with Gao Kan.</p>
<p>If Elder Mu continues to act recklessly, she will harm Shifu sooner or later. She wanted to ask her Shifu if there was still Mu Qingge in his heart. If there was, could he advise Mu Qingge to be a better person.</p>
<p>Thinking that she might have been the sister of such a woman in her previous life, Ranran really felt that it was good to not remember anything. Otherwise, having such a familial bond with such a selfish person might be really emotionally exhausting.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Thinking of this, Ranran sighed softly. Although she intended to advise, she didn’t know how to bring it up, especially considering her somewhat ambiguous relationship with her Shifu right now.</p>
<p>When Su Yishui draped his cloak over Ranran, she inexplicably asked, ‘Shifu, have you ever loved a woman?’</p>
<p>After asking, she immediately regretted it a little. Her Shifu had almost become an immortal couple with Wen Hongshan before, and later, he had been entangled with Mu Qingge. Recalling when he had kissed her, it didn’t seem like he was inexperienced and unsure, so asking this was really unnecessary!</p>
<p>With such a handsome appearance, outstanding demeanor, his romantic history is probably more than just these.</p>
<p>She asked about such private matters out of the blue; her Shifu is not going to tell her about them.</p>
<p>But Su Yishui, after listening, gazed at her very seriously and then asked, ‘What is love? Is it when your emotions are easily swayed by someone? Getting very angry at her, yet still unconsciously wanting to see her? Is it feeling excruciating heartache only after experiencing loss, living numbly? Or knowing that it can’t last forever with her, yet greedily wanting to……leave a trace in her heart?’</p>
<p>Ranran was at a loss at being asked. She had never loved anyone, so how could she understand such intense emotions as Shifu had described.</p>
<p>But the way he described it so vividly, it seemed that he had truly experienced love.</p>
<p>The person who could sway her master’s emotions and make him feel the pain of loss……probably only Mu Qingge!</p>
<p>Ranran suddenly realized that she had been holding her breath, and her chest seemed to have a sharp pain from not inhaling. Although this was something she had guessed long ago, when she heard it from his lips, she felt strangely uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Thinking of Elder Mu’s ruthless treatment of her Shifu, Ranran continued in a dull voice, ‘Shifu, what you just said may not be actually love. It’s just the irreconcilable feelings towards what has not been obtained… or maybe it could be just wishful thinking. If she doesn’t like you, why are you so stubborn not to let go?’</p>
<p>This seemed to hit the man’s vital spot, and now, its his turn to stop breathing for a long time. When Ranran looked up, she saw Shifu’s expression of unbearable anguish, and his eyes started to redden again…</p>
<p>Oh no, why did Shifu’s demonic nature flare up again? Just when she thought her Shifu was going to bend down to kiss her, the man, with a frosty expression, stood up abruptly and dashed out like a sword…</p>
<p>Ranran was left alone in the cold wind, wanting to chase after Shifu but unable to find his trace. Although her skills were improving, she was still far behind her master…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The next day, the streets of Wuma Town were crowded with soldiers returning from the front lines for rest and recuperation. People on the streets were also discussing the miraculous event of the celestial soldier appearing on the front lines yesterday.</p>
<p>It is said that during the battle between Daqi and Gao Kan’s armies yesterday, due to the fierce cavalry of Gao Kan, Daqi was in a declining position, losing ground.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, a ghostly shadow flashed by, completely unrecognizable in the dark night, fast as lightning, and all the Gao Kan soldiers it touched were thrown off their horses and captured on the ground.</p>
<p>Just this single ghostly figure reversed the situation and led to Daqi’s victory in the first battle.</p>
<p>The barbaric cruelty of Gao Kan’s soldiers had terrified the people at the border for a long time, so when they heard about this miracle, everyone exclaimed that the deities had come to help. It’s just that no one knows which deity has such divine power.</p>
<p>While eating lamb dumplings on the street, as Ranran listened to the excited discussions of the two little commanders at the next table, she also stole glances at her Shifu. She then whispered, ‘Shifu, you told me that earthly matters have their own fate, and we cultivators shouldn’t interfere casually…’</p>
<p>Perhaps others didn’t know who this divine figure was, but Ranran immediately guessed that it was her Shifu who had unleashed his demonic nature last night. His demonic nature seemed to have gotten stronger now and could no longer be suppressed by just kissing.</p>
<p>So those Gao Kan soldiers became his punching bags. Fortunately, her Shifu’s will was firm, and he didn’t kill them all, just pulled them off their horses, coincidentally helping the Daqi officials turn defeat into victory, saving the villagers of several nearby villages…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After hearing her question, Su Yishui appeared unwilling to respond. After taking a bite of the lamb dumplings on the street, he frowned slightly in dissatisfaction, as if he didn’t quite like it.</p>
<p>As Ranran looked at her Shifu, she suddenly felt a burst of pride in her heart. Even if her Shifu himself thought he was bad, she knew he was definitely a good person!</p>
<p>Thinking of this, she immediately leaned close to Su Yishui’s ear and said, ‘Shifu, just eat a bit for now. I’ll make you steamed soup dumplings and sweet chestnut eight treasures chicken for lunch alright?'”</p>
<p>Su Yishui turned his head to look at the young girl smiling sweetly at him, and his heart couldn’t help but give a lurch. He reached out with his long finger to wipe the oil from the corner of her mouth, then said expressionlessly, “And sweet and sour fish……”</p>
<p>Ranran nodded vigorously, then picked up a dumpling and fed it to her master’s mouth. This time, Su Yishui obediently opened his mouth and ate it, seeming to be less picky now.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The master and disciple were feeding each other and enjoying their meal together, but on the other side of the street market, a man standing on the balcony of a tavern widened his eyes in anger.</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan watched as Master kept his eyes on the master and disciple in the distance, and cautiously said, “Excellency, Su Yu is still waiting for you in the secluded valley. Shouldn’t you hurry back now?”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu cast a side glance at her with a dark sinister expression and said, “Do I need you to instruct me on what to do?”</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan lowered her head and remained silent. But she knew that just now, when Master was looking at the master and disciple at the dumpling stall, there was undisguised jealousy in his eyes…</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Tu Jiuyuan felt a wave of sadness in her heart.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But Wei Jiu didn’t think he was jealous; he just hated Su Yishui, that thousand-year-old fox, for always being one step ahead of him.</p>
<p>Back then, he and Su Yishui had encountered Mu Qingge nearly at the same time. He had tried hard to please her but failed, while Su Yishui, stood out by being aloof, and caught Mu Qingge’s favor.</p>
<p>Later, when Mu Qingge had a falling out with Su Yishui, Wei Jiu thought it was his chance. He tried to approach her again, expressing his willingness to become her disciple, only to be flatly rejected once more.</p>
<p>The seed of resentment was planted, and Wei Jiu just couldn’t swallow this slight. When Mu Qingge faced retribution and perished, thinking that he would have to carry this frustration with him until the end of time, made him so enraged that he madly chopped down trees by himself in the forest.</p>
<p>Later, when he learned that Mu Qingge had reincarnated on the tree, he felt somewhat comforted.  He vowed to seize the opportunity this time, setting up schemes by using the Grudge water, in order to control Mu Qingge firmly within his grasp.</p>
<p>Who knew that Su, that fox, would snatch an immature fruit and take it to his fox den early on? </p>
<p>He, Wei Jiu ended up wasting his efforts again!</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Wei Jiu couldn’t help but feel hateful! It was just eating dumplings, yet as master and disciple, *they actually behaved so intimately. When Ranran sweetly whispered in Su Yishui’s ear, Wei Jiu felt like his clenched fists could drip blood.<br/>*你侬我侬:  两个人（多指情侣）关系很好，很恩爱。<br/><em>Two people ( often a couple ) being very close and loving</em></p>
<p>He wasn’t a clueless kid about emotional matters; with just a glance, he could tell that this pair definitely harbored other feelings.</p>
<p>Su Yishui’s depravity surpassed that of twenty years ago! He only had to use small tricks, and Ranran who was still in her blooming youth, was grasped in his palm, giving him everything he desired.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu finally took a deep breath and stopped looking at the pair in the distance, turning around and striding downstairs.</p>
<p>After all, his feud with Su Yishui was far from over! This time, he had ventured into the Black Pool, and his cultivation also surged forward. If he could obtain the Spirit Spring, Su Yishui would be nothing then?</p>
<p>He was determined to one day crush Su Yishui into a pulp before Ranran, to show her which man was truly worthy of her!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, at the dumpling stall, the master and disciple settled their bill and got up. As they passed by a wine shop, Ranran couldn’t help but sigh softly, “Tu Jiuyuan has Elder Jiu’s spiritual talismans; that means he’s in Wei Jiu’s hands… I wonder how he’s doing now and when we can rescue him…”</p>
<p>At that moment, Su Yishui suddenly put his arm around her shoulder and said every word with emphasis, “Remember, I gave you this life. You owe no one, especially not to sacrifice yourself to save anyone else.”</p>
<p>Ranran thought Shifu’s tone was inexplicably serious, finding it somewhat amusing yet also touching, “Who says I owe no one? Although I don’t remember who I was in my past life or what happened, I’ve owed Shifu since birth!”</p>
<p>Su Yishui remained silent, saying quietly, “You don’t owe me; our debts are settled. You just need to focus on cultivating and fulfilling your path to immortality.”</p>
<p>When he said this, for some reason, Ranran felt a strange sense of detachment and indifference in his tone, as if the man who had kissed her before wasn’t him at all…</p>
<p>Ranran couldn’t help but think of the hidden room in Tianmai Mountain echoing with laughter from wife and children, the medicine field cottage and younger brother in the Illusory Realm of the Medicine Immortal.</p>
<p>When she ascended as an immortal, would she also hide away bits of memories about Shifu somewhere, occasionally revisiting them before leaving indifferently?</p>
<p>Ranran sighed and decided to eat more plums to suppress the sourness in her heart.</p>
<p>Human or Immortal, from her perspective, everyone wins some and loses some, making it difficult to find true fulfillment.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As for Su Yu, he was not in the palace at the moment but in the Blood Pool of Crimson Gate’s Mo Valley. Wei Jiu’s method to prolong Su Yu’s life was quite sinister, a method rarely used even among practitioners of the demonic path, involving transferring illness from one person to another.</p>
<p>Generally, this method was used to transfer sickness from a sick person to a healthy one. Mu Ranwu had used a similar method to treat the Prime Minister’s son before.</p>
<p>However, Wei Jiu’s method was even more vicious; most people who underwent this process died eventually.</p>
<p>Su Yu had once lost his soul, with his meridians severed. The person donating their health to him also needed to be a cultivator.</p>
<p>As Yiren Hall’s newly admitted couple of extraordinary beings were bound to iron chairs, and their spiritual energy was continuously absorbed into Su Yu’s body, his pale and emaciated body suddenly seemed revitalized, as if watered by celestial waters, and gradually regained vitality.</p>
<p>Even the fine lines around his eyes miraculously disappeared, making him look over a decade younger all of a sudden…</p>
<p>The body, once frail from prolonged illness, felt light and invigorated. This feeling was truly addictive.</p>
<p>However, Wei Jiu lazily commented, “Your Majesty, this method’s effect is short-lived and requires an increasing number of donors. If the process is interrupted, the backlash from the illness will be stronger. Therefore, for a permanent solution, we still need to find the Spirit Spring and utilize its power to ensure Your Majesty’s eternal well-being.”</p>
<p>Just two days ago, the Prime Minister’s son’s old ailment recurred with a vengeance, even before the court physician could be summoned, he had already breathed his last.</p>
<p>This led Prime Minister Lim to burst into tears, cursing Mu Qingge for deceiving and harming people.</p>
<p>Compared to that, Wei Jiu was more careful, explaining the pros and cons to Su Yu in advance, and also pointed out a more permanent solution.</p>
<p>Su Yu knew that Wei Jiu’s intentions in saying this were not about curing illnesses or saving people. He simply wanted to use the Spirit Spring as bait to manipulate a sovereign against Su Yishui.</p>
<p>However, when strong players teamed up, the game was always one move ahead. Whether one gained an advantage or suffered depended entirely on individual abilities.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Reports of front line battles would be timely conveyed to Su Yu, including the sudden appearance of a divine figure on the battlefield.</p>
<p>The border situation in Great Qi was stable, allowing Su Yu to breathe a little easier. The aftermath of his soul loss still lingered, and any disturbance on the front line would require a great deal of spiritual energy. </p>
<p>“Your Majesty, Miss Xue Ranran has not accepted Your Majesty’s kindness to stay at the Wu Ma Town Compound but has temporarily taken refuge in a horse stable.”</p>
<p>Su Yu nodded and calmly said, “Since she is unwilling, let it be as she wishes. However, prepare the clothing, equipment, and spring water from Huizhou Mountain for tea and the fragrant rice from Liu’an; deliver everything to the stable. She’s accustomed to fine things, and I fear she might suffer following Su Yishui…”</p>
<p>Before he could finish his words, Wei Jiu on the side laughed with his legs up, “I used to think Su Yishui was hypocritically detestable, but now I realize that everyone in the Su family is like this. Truly, talents emerge one after another, each with their own strengths! Now you were the one who put them on the wanted list, and you also watched as Mu Qingge framed Ranran. But looking at your words and actions now, I would think you’re her closest kin!”</p>
<p>Su Yu pretended not to understand the sarcasm in his words, continuing warmly, “Lord Wei, you also know that people do irrational things when they’re angry. Like you, my enemy is Su Yishui. I thought we had reached a consensus and formed a temporary alliance. But now you’ve brought Great Qi’s horses up to Gao Kan; what is your intention?”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu raised an eyebrow, “I only said I would join forces with you to deal with Su Yishui. As for your war with Gao Kan, that’s not within our consensus.”</p>
<p>Su Yu understood Wei Jiu’s meaning; in order to trip up Su Yishui, he would go to any lengths. As for whether Great Qi would win or lose in battle, he didn’t care at all, nor would he make any guarantees.</p>
<p>After all, Su Yu still relied on him for extending his life, and Wei Jiu didn’t care about this Emperor at all, let alone show any reverence.</p>
<p>Su Yu smiled faintly and didn’t speak further. Wei Jiu stood up, preparing to leave.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Unlike Su Yu’s superficial flattery, Wei Jiu always valued overpowering strength.</p>
<p>Although Su Yishui had the Spirit Spring, he did not dare to fully activate it and instead used his own body to imprison it, which became his fatal flaw.</p>
<p>Even if Su Yishui took Ranran as his disciple, so what? Without ability, how was he qualified to teach disciples?</p>
<p>Wei Jiu once again thought of the moments he spent with Xue Ranran on Tianmai Mountain. Ranran had been the one to give him a handful of dried sweet potatoes first, and always found reasons to talk to him.</p>
<p>From this perspective, Ranran’s initial impression of him was not too bad. Thinking of the scene where they fought side by side against the Immortal Devouring Bugs, Wei Jiu’s heart was stirred.</p>
<p>As for that Su Yishui, being possessed by the Spirit Spring again, it probably wouldn’t be so easy for him to come out unscathed.</p>
<p>Of course, Ranran didn’t need to sink with the declining Xishan Sect; the gates of Crimson Gate were wide open to welcome her. By then, she would realize that his abilities were far stronger than Su Yishui and could help her recover her cultivation sooner…</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, Wei Jiu unconsciously competed with the cultivator Su Yishui at every turn, and this unresolved emotions had turned into a demonic obsession. Now, discovering that Su Yishui had once again taken the lead, how could he just let it go?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he waved for someone to escort Su Yu out. This young chap full of smiles was the most sinister; by prolonging Su Yu’s life, he had put the biggest stumbling block in Su Yishui’s path.</p>
<p>Su Yu didn’t mind Wei Jiu’s disrespect towards him. Just before leaving, he gently reminded Wei Jiu, “Your grievances are with Su Yishui, and Ranran is just a naive girl. She only cares about her master, so please bear with her…”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu felt that Su Yu was really shameless. Ranran was not the property of the Great Qi’s Majesty; what did it mean for him to speak like a patriarchal figure?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>
<p>Oh no Ranran, stop telling your Shifu that Mu Qingge doesn’t love him…<br/>That poor guy lol How much more can he take? That’s two times now lol</p>
<p>I wonder if Wei Jiu is the example by the author of who Ranran meant, someone who is stubbornly hanging onto unrequited feelings lol He obviously is obsessed with Mu Qingge, but he is in denial about it…</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">身有奇能 EXTRAORDINARY TALENT</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Su Yu’s sentence “<em>she only cares about her master</em>” was indeed displeasing to hear.</p>
<p>After saying these words, Su Yu got up and boarded the dragon carriage. He had been away from the Capital for too long, and the important ministers and nobles in the capital were probably restless by now.</p>
<p>But that was fine; it was just the right time for everyone below to do their own thing, to see how they form alliances and make their moves. When he returned and gave a show of his wrath, they would know just how little they matter.</p>
<p>Preparing to return to the Capital, Su Yu looked up at the sky. On his face, which had regained its handsome and youthful appearance, there was a hint of a wry smile. He then ordered the eunuchs around him to quickly set off for the Capital.</p>
<p>Because he knew that although Great Qi’s current war was going smoothly, the border conflicts no longer required his worry. However, a second life-and-death battle was soon to come here.</p>
<p>And what he had to do was watch the tigers fight from afar, hoping that this great battle would deplete the cultivation and spiritual power of these cultivators.</p>
<p>The previous setbacks in the battle with Gao Kan had made Su Yu even more vigilant now. Once these cultivators harbored evil intentions, they posed the greatest threat to the supreme Imperial authority!</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he sighed softly. If Qingge had known that he was so apprehensive about cultivators, would she still have changed Su Yishui’s destiny as emperor?</p>
<p>However, no matter what she thought, he didn’t think he was wrong in doing so. Once one is in that position, one’s thoughts and actions were beyond one’s control. If Su Yishui had taken that position, he would probably have been even more tyrannical.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, an emperor’s gentle affection signaled the downfall of a nation. Thinking of this, he slowly closed his eyes, no longer looking at the rolling dark clouds outside the carriage that signaled an impending storm…</p>
<p>The Chief Steward by his side had served Su Yu for many years, and back then, he had also witnessed the interactions between the young emperor and the War Goddess. His Majesty’s worry for the War Goddess was understandable.</p>
<p>However, he couldn’t help but feel that His Majesty’s words to Wei Jiu just now was not entrusting her into his care, but rather a provocation, stirring up Wei Jiu’s jealousy. Thinking of this, the old eunuch in the palace understood it all too well.</p>
<p>But remembering the War Goddess who had once treated his leg injury, the old eunuch sighed quietly in his heart.</p>
<p>May good people receive good rewards; may the War Goddess live a peaceful life this time…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After seeing off the Emperor who had been granted an extension of life, Wei Jiu waved and summoned Tu Jiuyuan, “Has the elder from the Fantian Sect left?”</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan nodded, “They have left after sending Elder Jiu here. But… Your Excellency, the Fantian Sect has been silent for hundreds of years, and now they suddenly emerge to cooperate with you in finding the Spirit Spring. Do you think it might be a trap?”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu sneered, “These few think I’m a fool and want me to stick my head out for them. Since that’s the case, why not play along with their wishes? Has that Elder Jiu drawn the Soul-Cleansing talisman I wanted?”</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan replied in a low voice, “Drawing the talisman consumes spiritual energy. When that Elder Jiu drew the Beast Control talismans, he had already expended most of his spiritual power. These days, he’s been clamoring for wine and refuses to draw more talismans…”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu coldly snorted, “Since he wants it, give it to him!”</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan hesitated, “But whenever he drinks, he gets drunk for a day, then wakes up and demands more…”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu frowned, “That old thing, you find a way to deal with him. Tell him that if he refuses again, we’ll push him into the Spirit Python Pool. When the pool of spirit snakes biting and entwining him, it will surely cure his alcohol addiction!”</p>
<p>The efficacy of the Soul-cleansing talisman is not inferior to reincarnation. Since he did not receive the Spiritual Fruit initially and missed Ranran’s reincarnation moment, perhaps it wouldn’t be so bad if he could let her forget about her present life again and let him become her master.</p>
<p>Thinking of Ranran calling him softly as her master while blushing in his arms, Wei Jiu’s mind wandered off for a moment as he raised his cup towards the red moon in the secluded valley and took a sip…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The border battles continued unabated, but the soldiers of Great Qi became more courageous as they fought, quickly pushing the front lines towards Gao Kan’s borders.</p>
<p>Although Wuma Town was not as bustling as usual, many merchants from outside the border rushed into the town to avoid the war, making it lively.</p>
<p>However, Su Yishui did not relax his demands on his disciples because of the border conflicts. Especially for Ranran, who had now regained her strength and opened her spirit channel, she could now practice the Thousand School Sword Technique.</p>
<p>This was the unique skill of all Sect leaders of Xishan, and as the face of Xishan, Ranran naturally had to learn it.</p>
<p>However, unlike controlling just one sword, the Thousand School Sword Technique required simultaneous control of five short swords, each with a different trajectory and role in actual combat.</p>
<p>Ranran could easily control one sword, but when it came to two swords, she struggled, let alone controlling all five swords at once.</p>
<p>When Su Yishui threw a handful of soybeans towards Ranran, she could only rely on her spiritual power to block them with her sword.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the two swords didn’t listen at all, let alone slice through the densely packed soybeans.</p>
<p>As a result, all the beans landed on her.</p>
<p>When Su Yishui threw them, the beans had some vital force, so they hurt quite a bit when they landed.</p>
<p>But before Ranran could cry out in pain, Su Yishui’s face had already turned cold as he rebuked sternly, “While controlling the swords, why did you drop your spiritual shield? Do you really think your sword aura is impenetrable and can withstand attacks?”</p>
<p>Ranran knew she was at fault and could only explain, “Shifu, I was momentarily distracted, so…”</p>
<p>“No excuses. Do you think you can always rely on the protection of others? If one day I’m not by your side, with your current level of cultivation, can you protect yourself?”</p>
<p>When Su Yishui reprimanded her coldly with a serious expression, the senior disciples practicing nearby quietly slipped away, leaving Ranran alone to receive the lecture.</p>
<p>Although Shifu’s temperament had been unpredictable since being possessed by the Spirit Spring, he had always been good to the little junior sister.</p>
<p>However, recently, Su Yi Shui seemed even stricter with Ranran, making people hesitant to even try to persuade him.</p>
<p>Ranran lowered her head, listening to the reprimand from her Shifu. When Su Yishui finished, she raised her head and said in a small voice, “Didn’t you say you wouldn’t let me marry? Why can’t I always stay by your side?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui pursed his lips and looked at the teary-eyed young girl. He paused for a moment and said, “Your talent far surpasses ordinary people, and your progress in cultivation will be fast. One day, you will ascend to immortality, and naturally, I won’t be by your side then.”</p>
<p>Ranran did not understand, “Shifu, are you saying that your cultivation level is far above mine, and when you ascend to immortality, you’ll leave me behind?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui fell silent for a moment and said quietly, “I was being too hasty. But the principles of controlling swords depends on your own understanding. If you can grasp the key points, your progress will be faster… Practice on your own; I’m going to meditate.”</p>
<p>With that, he turned and walked towards his room.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran silently watched Su Yishui’s tall figure. Through his white collar, she vaguely saw a black line like a blood vessel appear on the back of his neck.</p>
<p>She knew that the black line on his wrist had now spread to his neck. Once the black line encircled his neck, he would completely succumb to demonic influence.</p>
<p>The power of the Spirit Spring lies in destruction, catering to people’s inner desires, fulfilling the wishes of the host without restraint, thereby igniting greater greed in the heart.</p>
<p>However, Su Yishui went against the norm, constantly suppressing his greatest desires. Naturally, this provoked the backlash of the Spirit Spring. Once these long-repressed desires erupted, the demonic nature would also be multifold, with unimaginable consequences…</p>
<p>Ranran originally hoped that she could help Shifu by being a pleasant diversion and alleviate his demonic nature. But recently, he had been avoiding her. His aesthetic mood of getting her to look at the moon and flowers at night with him, also seemed to have disappeared.</p>
<p>She thought he had gotten weary of it. After all, reminiscing about the past with an unrelated person *was rather pointless.<br/>隔靴搔痒 <em>literally: scratching outside the boot</em></p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Until later on, she discovered that every nightfall, Su Yishui had Uncle Master Zeng Yi use chains made of xuan iron and a golden talisman to chain himself in the mountains outside the town.</p>
<p>If she hadn’t encountered Uncle Master Zeng returning at night, and that he wasn’t good at lying when she tried to sound him out, wouldn’t she have been kept in the dark?</p>
<p>When Ranran followed Uncle Master Zeng to the mountains, watching her Shifu resist the demonic nature with great effort while being chained by xuan iron, she couldn’t hold back her tears and rushed towards him.</p>
<p>Her Shifu, who was usually elegant like an exiled immortal, had to endure such torment in private. When she tried to approach, Su Yishui didn’t allow it, only struggling to tell Uncle Master Zeng to take her away.</p>
<p>The longer the Spirit Spring resided, the stronger the demonic nature became. It always tried every means to tempt him into doing things that would fulfill his desires but harm Ranran.</p>
<p>So Su Yishui could only seal himself with the xuan iron chain and the golden talisman during the night when the demonic nature was strongest, while staying in the mountains far away from Ranran, to suppress the turbulence in his body. He did not want Ranran to see his current sorry state.</p>
<p>The human heart, is always insatiable. He had originally thought that just staying by her side and watching her grow step by step would be enough. But later, how did he gradually become more greedy, longing to kiss her, longing to see his reflection in her eyes?</p>
<p>But now, just hugging and kissing passionately wasn’t enough anymore. When he smelled the faint fragrance on her body, he madly wanted to imprint her deeply into his body…</p>
<p>He could not ask for anymore. Su Yishui couldn’t control the expanding desire from the Spirit Spring, so he could only lock himself up when the demonic nature was strongest at night.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran wanted to accompany her Shifu on the mountain, but Uncle Master Zeng Yi stubbornly dragged her down.</p>
<p>“He’s always been cold by nature, and when he had been possessed by the Spirit Spring, he almost killed you… his Master… So, when it’s nighttime, it’s best not to get close to him. He’ll be fine when the sun comes up.”</p>
<p>Looking back at the mountain, Ranran could faintly hear her master’s painful sobbing through the dense forest. She asked softly, “How did my Shifu break free from the Spirit Spring’s entanglement in the past?”</p>
<p>Uncle Master Zeng Yi sighed heavily, “You went to the Capital with your master, so you should know some past events. He was a concubine’s child of Prince Ping, without a father’s care since childhood. His mother suffered unfair treatment in the household, and his heart naturally harbored resentment. Besides, he was born at the most Yin hour. Prince Ping, influenced by evil arts, planned to use him to inherit the Spirit Spring, hoping for a smooth ascension to the throne. So when Su Yishui joined the cultivation sects, he had ulterior motives. He was young at the time but cunning, always scheming, always manipulating… If it wasn’t for you… My Master who discovered it in time, he would’ve almost become a demon king… You know the rest. My Master exhausted her life force to remove the Spirit Spring from him, later fell into a trap, and ultimately perished……”</p>
<p>Uncle Master Zeng Yi was originally talking about Su Yishui, and Ranran was listening attentively. Unexpectedly, he suddenly shifted the focus to her: “So, remember, don’t bite off more than you can chew. Life is precious, and you have attachments; your parents are getting old and waiting for you to care for them. Never put yourself in danger, like going into the mountains with your master, without thinking of your parents, forgetting your filial duties!”</p>
<p>Ranran listened with her mouth half-open, feeling like taking one more step towards the mountain would turn her into an unforgivable villain who was unfilial to her parents.</p>
<p>But deep down, she knew her Shifu was also losing control of the Spirit Spring. She just didn’t know when they would find the entrance to the Netherworld realm.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>On this night, even though she didn’t go up the mountain, she waited at the foot of the mountain all night. When the sky turned light, Ranran who was leaning against the tree, sensed someone approaching and opened her eyes immediately.</p>
<p>Shifu had already descended the mountain, his usually clear eyes showing signs of exhaustion as he draped his coat over her.</p>
<p>“Shifu, are you feeling better”</p>
<p>Su Yishui lowered his head to look at her and said, “Why have you been here all night?”</p>
<p>Ranran looked at the black lines on his neck which seemed to have grown more, sighed silently, and stopped asking. Instead, she asked, “Shifu, when will the entrance to the Netherworld realm appear?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui shook his head slowly and said in a low voice, “If we still don’t have the location of the entrance seven days from now, I’ll have Uncle Master Zeng Yi take you away.”</p>
<p>Ranran asked again, “And what about you?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui lowered his gaze and said, “The Spirit Spring is an ultimate Yin entity and cannot be destroyed, but I will find a hidden place, sever my meridians, draw it out, and then seal it…”</p>
<p>“NO!” Ranran panicked upon hearing this, grabbing Su Yishui’s hand.</p>
<p>Su Yishui squeezed her hand back, noting the calluses on her once soft palm from daily sword practices in Xishan.</p>
<p>Just like her twenty years ago, whenever he was sick, she would touch his forehead with her callused hand. That woman in red would be in all smiles and sit by his bed, coaxing him to take medicine: “Be good Yi’er, after drinking this, I’ll give you salted longan fruits…”</p>
<p>He always seemed to see her smiling, even at the moment of death, when she was knocked away and saw him in mid-air, she still had a calm smile…</p>
<p>In the years that followed, he always wondered if her last smile was in self-mockery. Did she ever think that if she hadn’t taken in a traitor like him back then, would she still be untroubled, laughing at the world like Elder Jiu, living carefree, unrestrained and free?</p>
<p>Ranran saw at her master looking at her, but lost in thought again. She couldn’t help but hug his neck and said softly, “Shifu, no matter when, I will never abandon you.”</p>
<p>Since leaving the sea island, everything had gradually returned to how it used to be. Su Yishui hadn’t indulged himself for a long time, to be so affectionate with her.</p>
<p>After a night of torment, this tender intimacy seemed to be the best comfort. Su Yishui slowly reached out and hugged Ranran.</p>
<p>In the dim light of dawn, the two couldn’t help but embrace and kiss again…</p>
<p>When Ranran got a little delirious from the kissing, her thoughts vaguely wandered to that time during sword practice, when Shifu said he wouldn’t always be there with her. Had he already made up his mind to die?</p>
<p>The thought of him dying alone in a secluded corner suddenly brought a sharp pain to Ranran’s heart. Her body went completely limp, and she fainted in Su Yishui’s arms.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When Ranran woke up again, she was already back in a room at the trading post, with familiar herbal root water boiling on the stove.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier was pouring medicine and let out a long sigh of relief when she turned and saw Ranran awake.</p>
<p>“Young Madam, you finally woke up. What happened? Did your old illness flare up?”</p>
<p>Since joining Xishan, Ranran hadn’t had a relapse for a long time. So she just shook her head and said, “Maybe I caught a cold. I should be fine after taking the medicine.”</p>
<p>Qiu Xier sighed in relief, feeding Ranran the medicine and saying, “Many refugees have arrived in town recently. The old temple is crowded and there are beggars everywhere. But that Elder Mu seems interesting; her disciple Wang Suizhi is recruiting disciples with a signboard. Only orphans without parents with handsome looks are accepted. Our Xishan Grandmaster hasn’t changed her tastes indeed!”</p>
<p>Ranran couldn’t tell if Elder Mu was good or evil now. After all, the woman in Shifu and Uncle Master’s words and the present her, was like a completely different person.</p>
<p>But Elder Mu taking in disciples was a good thing, just like in her past life, helping more orphans and preventing them from starving to death.</p>
<p>When Ranran got up, she asked where Shifu was. Upon hearing that he was in seclusion again, she understood that he might be unsettled and needed solitude, so she didn’t disturb him.</p>
<p>After she had enough sleep and felt fine, she took Qiu Xier to the town to buy groceries as usual. The disciples of Xishan were accustomed to her cooking, so whenever Ranran had free time, she would personally buy groceries for cooking.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As they walked near the western entrance of the town, they indeed saw Wang Suizhi asking dozens of street children one by one, preparing to select some with excellent aptitude.</p>
<p>Having nothing else to do, Ranran carried the basket of vegetables and listened nearby.</p>
<p>The standards set by Elder Mu for accepting disciples were quite peculiar. She didn’t inquire about their backgrounds or examine their spiritual veins; she only asked about the children’s birth dates.</p>
<p>After recording all the details, Wang Suizhi instructed his attendants to read out the selected children’s names.</p>
<p>Ranran always had an excellent memory. Even without pen and paper, she silently memorized the birth dates of the dozen or so children before her.</p>
<p>As the attendants read out the names, she watched the children’s excited expressions and matched them one by one, realizing that Elder Mu seemed to have a preference for children born in the twelfth lunar month.</p>
<p>The twelfth lunar month marked the transition to spring and was known for its heavy yin energy according to folklore. Did the fortune teller calculate this Elder Mu? Saying that these yin-heavy disciples would greatly benefit her?</p>
<p>When Wang Suizhi looked up, he noticed a young girl holding a basket of vegetables on the side, watching the commotion… It turned out to be Xue Ranran, who had confronted the head of the Jiuhua Sect that day!</p>
<p>He involuntarily took a step back, looking at her warily but with a polite smile, asking, “May I ask what Miss Xue is doing here?”</p>
<p>Ranran pointed to where he had set up his tables: “This is where the old lady sells dried tofu. You’ve occupied it, so the old lady can’t set up her stall, and I can’t make leek and dried tofu stir-fry tonight.”</p>
<p>Thinking she had come with hostile intentions, Wang Suizhi didn’t expect her response to be so down-to-earth.</p>
<p>One of his attendants, feeling indignant, spoke up, “This town is guarded by General Qin Xuanjiu. We’ve requisitioned this place with the general’s permission.”</p>
<p>However, Wang Suizhi waved his hand to stop the attendant’s rudeness, respectfully greeted the old lady who had been waiting nervously by the side for a long time, and then had the table removed to make way for her stall.</p>
<p>As Wang Suizhi was about to leave, he saw that Xue Ranran had bought all the dried tofu from the old lady.</p>
<p>Wang Suizhi smiled, “It seems Miss Xue really loves dried tofu!”</p>
<p>Ranran also smiled, “It’s already past noon. Even if the old lady sets up her stall, there won’t be many customers. I might as well buy it all. How about it? Does Elder Mu like dried tofu? I can’t finish all of these; I can give you some.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Wang Suizhi was momentarily stunned, then blushed slightly. Although he had come from humble origins, he had become successful in business and hadn’t experienced for a long time, the hardships of setting up an open-air street stall and earning a few coins.</p>
<p>Obviously, he was the one who had been choosing orphans for a long time, even unintentionally occupying the old lady’s stall. Yet, he didn’t think about compensation when he was about to leave… In comparison, he was not as good as this disciple from Xishan, who showed more empathy for the poor.</p>
<p>“This…by rights I should pay for it. How can I ask you, Miss, to compensate?”</p>
<p>Ranran smiled slightly, “It’s not much money; please don’t be standing on ceremony with me, sir.” After speaking, she had Qiu Xier give Wang Suizhi half of the basket of dried tofu.</p>
<p>Although there had been discord between the former master and disciple of Xishan, they were still of the same sect and its not too much to share some dried tofu together.</p>
<p>*One doesn’t hit someone who smiles at you; although Master had a falling-out with Su Yishui, but Xue Ranran, as his disciple niece, was quite lovable.<br/>伸手不打笑脸人<em> can’t bear to hit someone smiling at you</em></p>
<p>So Wang Suizhi could only accept it and then pondered for a moment before saying, “Miss, you have a very kind heart. If you head east in the city, fortune awaits you there.”</p>
<p>After that, he left with his entourage.</p>
<p>Ranran was somewhat skeptical of his words, but since the east side of the city wasn’t far, she decided to take a walk there.</p>
<p>As a result, as soon as she arrived at the eastern market, she accidentally stumbled on a stone under her foot. When she looked down, she saw a piece of silver that someone had dropped, just enough to cover the cost of the dried tofu.</p>
<p>So when everyone gathered for dinner that night, Ranran casually mentioned this incident. Zeng Yi, upon hearing it, wasn’t at all surprised and said, “The disciples of Xishan are not all lacking in spiritual energies; it’s just that their way of awakening is a bit unique and doesn’t enter the eyes of those prestigious sects. For example, Wang Suizhi, do you know why he is so wealthy and can rival a nation? It’s all because he can discern the flow of wealth without missing a detail. Picking up money is not a difficult task for him. However, it’s really stingy of him to let you pick up just that little silver.”</p>
<p>Zeng Yi seemed to look down on the calculating Wang Suizhi, and after speaking, he even snorted coldly.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">魔花盛开   DEMONIC BLOOMS</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Ranran nodded in admiration after hearing that.</p>
<p>Thinking it over, the former disciples of Xishan were indeed all extraordinary. Qin Xuanjiu was always able to escape death with his good luck, Zeng Yi had a natural talent for exquisite craftsmanship, and now Wang Suizhi’s ability to find wealth everywhere was truly astonishing.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier was very fascinated by such extraordinary skills and kept asking if she could also practice such divine techniques?</p>
<p>Zeng Yi smiled wryly, “Such divine skills are innate talents, how could they be trained after birth? But what exactly is Wang Suizhi doing by recruiting so many orphans born in the twelfth lunar month?”</p>
<p>As Yutong added vegetables to her son’s bowl, she said, “What else can it be? It’s just an old habit acting up, finding some fresh youthful faces to please the eye…”</p>
<p>She stopped abruptly, realizing that her master was also recruited by Mu Qingge for his appearance to please her eye. She was afraid of touching her master’s emotional scar by mentioning it.</p>
<p>However, Elder Mu was no longer associated with Xishan and she now had a disciple who could attract wealth. She wasn’t short of money and it was her own business to have as many disciples as she liked.</p>
<p>As long as she didn’t provoke her Master now, it’s all fine.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When Wang Suizhi brought those orphans back to see his Master, some of the attendants on the side spoke out about encountering Xue Ranran.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu, who had just finished meditating, slowly raised her head and stared at Wang Suizhi, asking, “What do you think of that girl?”</p>
<p>Wang Suizhi didn’t understand the meaning behind his Master’s question and honestly replied, “Seems to be a amiable girl…”</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu’s eyes, hiding sharpness in her gentle gaze, immediately shot over, calmly asking, “Is it just because she takes care of the elderly? Back on Tianmai Mountain, she was the one who accused and slandered me……that’s the same amiable girl that you speak of. “</p>
<p>Thus reminded by his Master, Wang Suizhi was jolted awake and quickly said, “Please rest assured, Master. I shall bear in mind and not be deceived by her facade again… But it seems that Old Fourteen has a good relationship with Su Yishui. Currently, the Xishan disciples are all living under Old Fourteen’s Horse Trading Post.”</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu thought of Zeng Yi’s bare palms and didn’t care much.</p>
<p>Just a useless person willing to associate with Su Yishui could go right ahead. After all, the capable disciples of her sister were now gathered around her; she was not lacking a disabled person with crippled hands!</p>
<p>Seeing that his Master still seemed upset, Wang Suizhi tried to ease the tension, “Master, now that you are taking in more disciples again and will find a famous mountain in the future, I will definitely build a palace for you that is no less than Xishan. You can establish your own sect and make it flourish. By then, how can Xishan compare to you? But Master, you must cherish your reputation and not give others a chance to slander you again. I noticed some people from Gao Kan came to visit you recently…”</p>
<p>After giving him a glance, Mu Ranwu smiled slightly, “Although I have never had private dealings with the Prince of Yiling, it’s normal for him to send someone to visit me since he has long admired the Immortal way. Why? Do I need to report my every action to you?”</p>
<p>Wang Suizhi quickly waved his hand, saying he wouldn’t dare. His Master always acted as she pleased; how could he expect her to report everything to him?</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu didn’t say much more and waved for Wang Suizhi to leave. Her sister’s disciples were all trained by her to be quite rigid; it seemed she needed to be more cautious about her connection with Gao Kan. After all, she now relied on these disciples for support.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Prince of Yiling in Gao Kan was just a lame duck. She had already given him the beast-control talismans, yet they were foiled by Xue Ranran, *allowing her to look good before the three major sects, Mu Ranmu felt stifled.<br/>*露了脸 : 光榮、很有面子</p>
<p>Surrounded by useless people, unable to improve her cultivation, and watching Xue Ranran, a sickly child, gradually catching up to her, it was really frustrating.</p>
<p>So Mu Ranmu decided to take a different approach and find simpler ways to replenish the spiritual energy that she lost while staying at the palace.</p>
<p>Thinking of the method unintentionally mentioned by Tu Jiuyuan, Mu Ranwu was initially unwilling.</p>
<p>She knew that the spiritual energy she had snatched from her sister was righteous celestial energy, not of the demonic kind.</p>
<p>If she really used Wei Jiu’s method, it would deviate her from the righteous path. But seeing Xue Ranran already able to fight Jiuhua’s Master Kaiyuan and gain the upper hand, Mu Ranwu no longer cared about right or wrong.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu had also relied on depriving others of their spiritual power to rapidly increase his own power, so Tu Jiuyuan’s replenishment method was feasible.</p>
<p>But she had to do it secretly, without anyone noticing. Because she was reincarnated from the tree, she needed children of utmost Yin to match.</p>
<p>So she had Wang Suizhi recruit children born on the most Yin days of the twelfth lunar month.</p>
<p>Children with innate talent often opened their spiritual channels much faster than adults. Once these children had a foundation, she would absorb their spiritual energy, and they would at most become weak and sickly, and nobody would notice.</p>
<p>Seeing the dozen or so dirty children Wang Suizhi brought, Mu Ranwu breathed a sigh of relief. After all, with her foundation, such talent should not go to waste?</p>
<p>“Big sister, in this life, I will never let you surpass me!”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The border war ended faster than expected.</p>
<p>Because right before the war, hundreds of officials and soldiers from Gao Kan had been captured, and with the sudden appearance of a divine shadow during that previous battle, all sorts of superstitious rumors emerged.</p>
<p>The country of Gao Kan was originally superstitious, reverent towards gods and spirits, so this greatly affected their morale. The Prince of Yiling was furious, repeatedly asking his new Imperial Advisor Elder Mu why there were no response plans.</p>
<p>But Mu Ranmu ignored him completely. She relied solely on her disciple the General, hiding in Wuma Town and not coming out. In the end, the envoys he sent had never returned.</p>
<p>The King of Yiling suspected that the envoys had been killed by Mu Qingge, but without seeing any sign or bodies, he was furious and suspected he had been fooled by Mu Qingge again, wondering if she was still working for Daqi and had set him up?</p>
<p>From this moment, the vengeful King of Yiling completely hated this Elder Mu.</p>
<p>Although the war had temporarily ended, the days of continued warfare had left widespread grief, and the bodies that were yet to be buried attracted crows that refused to leave.</p>
<p>After Gao Kan’s army withdrew, Mu Ranwu led her disciples through the desolate grasslands where the armies had fought. It was already autumn. The autumn wind was bleak, but red flower buds began to bloom on the gradually yellowing grass…</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu squinted at the flower buds on the ground, feeling a sense of familiarity.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she remembered that before her sister entered the underworld in her past life, she had also seen such a splendid and bizarre patch of red flowers near the entrance to the underworld.</p>
<p>She couldn’t help but look up at the sky, seeing it covered in dark clouds, a sign of the most Yin and cold energy converging. Even if she hadn’t read the “Records of the Fantian Sect,” she guessed that this was an omen of changes in the world.</p>
<p>Thinking that the disciples of Xishan had been staying here without leaving, were they waiting for something?</p>
<p>While thinking about this, people arrived on the other side of the wilderness as well. Su Yishui had brought his disciples from Xishan to this place.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu glanced at Qin Xuanjiu behind her, feeling confident. Even if Su Yishui realized she was an imposter, so what?</p>
<p>Based on his character, he would definitely not want her sister to continue using Mu Qingge’s name. That dog emperor didn’t care who she really was either. Compared to Xue Ranran, who followed Su Yishui wholeheartedly, Su Yu needed a war goddess who could stand by his side, whether she was real or fake. As for Wei Jiu, it seemed he didn’t want to expose Xue Ranran’s true identity either.</p>
<p>So Mu Ranwu was very composed now. But with her present strength, she was not ready for a direct confrontation with the Xishan sect.</p>
<p>And these red flowers seem peculiar; she needs Xishan to go and investigate first. So when Su Yishui and the others arrived, Mu Ranwu only coldly indicated they should go back, without even waiting to meet face-to-face, she turned and left.</p>
<p>When Ranran saw Wang Suizhi, the God of Wealth, she wanted to greet him kindly and thank him for his tip for last time. But Wang Suizhi just glared at her coldly and then turned away.</p>
<p>Ranran couldn’t help but feel embarrassed. She stuck her tongue out at Qiu Xier beside her, but before she could comment, she was attracted by the red flowers on the wilderness.</p>
<p>The killings at the border of the two countries had finally accumulated enough Yin energy, and strange flowers is about to bloom on the blood-stained land…</p>
<p>The most intense battlefield where the two armies fought was filled with bloodshed, and the red flowers there really flourished, already forming a sea of red.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that this is a deep autumn grassland, where the green grass has already turned yellow. And at this time, the emergence of red flowers with no name is indeed strange and unusual.</p>
<p>After the soldiers of both countries withdrew, the nomads’ horses and cattle continued to come to the wilderness to graze. However, wherever there were red buds with hook-shaped petals, the horses and cattle refused to approach, even if the nomads whipped them, they just stood there crying out.</p>
<p>Ranran looked at the flower buds before her, feeling that their dark red color resembled coagulated blood clots, and their shape, like fierce eagle beaks, exuded a murderous aura.</p>
<p>She couldn’t help but think of the line from ‘Records of the Fantian Sect,’ ‘Eagle Beak Demon Flower, opens by chasing blood.’ Were these flowers, born from bloodstains, the Eagle Beak Demon Flowers recorded in the book?</p>
<p>It seemed that Shifu’s speculation was correct; these vicious flowers did bloom on the battlefield covered with corpses.</p>
<p>“……How come there are so many Eagle Beak Flowers? Could it be that evil spirits are emerging again in this world?”</p>
<p>Ranran followed the sound and saw an old herdsman sitting on a horse suddenly hoarsely saying.</p>
<p>“Old Uncle, do you know these flowers?” Ranran asked curiously.</p>
<p>But when the old herdsman turned his head, Qiu Xier beside Ranran cried out in shock.</p>
<p>It turned out that the old man was thin with a face full of wrinkles, and only had two deep-set eye sockets on his face, with both eyeballs missing.</p>
<p>Lately, the weather has been overcast with no sunlight penetrating through. In such a gloomy weather, suddenly seeing such an old man near the strange flower sea on the wilderness, those with weak hearts could really pee themselves on the spot.</p>
<p>Ranran was also startled, but what puzzled her more was how could he see so many Eagle Beak Flowers without eyes?</p>
<p>But looking at the old man, besides looking scary, there was no spiritual aura on him; he was just an ordinary person.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier also asked, “Are you… human or ghost? How can you see these flowers without eyes?”</p>
<p>The old herdsman’s voice was desolate, “I used to be a soldier on the border, followed the War Goddess into the battle of Fanyao, experienced life and death, and lost a pair of eyes. At that time, the Fanyao battlefield covered with corpses was also full of these flowers. After seeing them once, I couldn’t forget their appearance… Little girl, judging from your voice, you’re still young; stay away from these flowers. They are not good things. Although I have no eyes, I can see them. Don’t you think they are sinister?”</p>
<p>After saying this, the old herdsman urged his old horse and, listening to the sound, drove the sheep herd back.</p>
<p>Ranran asked him from behind, “Excuse me, do these flowers eat people?”</p>
<p>This time, the old herdsman shook his head, “They don’t eat people, but they can make people eat people. Don’t go near to look at them, especially do not smell them, be careful not to lose your soul…”</p>
<p>As he spoke, accompanied by the bell sound on the old horse, the blind old herdsman urged the old horse and quickly moved away from these red flowers.</p>
<p>Ranran watched his receding back. She turned her head to speak to Shifu, but found that Shifu had been staring intently at the sea of red flowers.</p>
<p>She quickly reached out to pull him, whispering, “Shifu, what’s wrong with you?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui seemed to be jolted back to his senses. He barely suppressed the spreading redness in his eyes and said to Ranran and the others, “Let’s leave quickly; these flowers are just flower buds for now. Once they bloom, they will emit toxins. If people inhale too much of it, they will lose themselves.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Gao Cang and Yuchen, who had already stepped into the flower sea, quickly retreated.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Just as everyone was about to move away from these flowers, a sudden west wind blew in. When the wind blew through the sea of flowers, those eagle-beak-like flower buds slowly bloomed, like eagles suddenly opening their beaks, spitting out blood-red stamens, like small tongues trembling in the wind.</p>
<p>In an instant, the entire flower sea was filled with fragrance, and a strong aroma spread out.</p>
<p>Ranran reacted the fastest. She quickly took out a Calming Pill, crushed it into two small pills, and stuffed it into her Shifu’s nose.</p>
<p>He already had the Spirit Spring’s demonic nature; if he were to be poisoned by the demon flower too, he would simply become a humanoid killing machine.</p>
<p>Su Yishui seemed to feel that this was demeaning, dodging his head, but unable to stop Ranran, he was still stuffed with the pills.</p>
<p>He helplessly looked at Ranran stuffing her own nostrils, saying, “Just hold your breath; why are you doing this?”</p>
<p>With Shifu’s cultivation level, holding his breath underwater for three days and nights was no problem at all as long as he didn’t inhale anything. But Ranran couldn’t take the chance, so stuffing was safer.</p>
<p>Although Ranran was not at Shifu’s level, holding her breath for *half an hour was also possible. But she also stuffed two pills to seal her nostrils.<br/><em>*a stick of incense time 30-45min</em></p>
<p>But standing in the flower sea, Gao Cang and Xier obviously had no guard up. By the time Ranran wanted to stuff their noses, they had already inhaled the fragrance and pollen of the flowers into their noses.</p>
<p>In an instant, their bodies were covered in a faint red halo.</p>
<p>Next, suddenly, Qiu Xier’s eyebrows and eyes seemed to have been painted with a brush, her features became three-dimensional and beautiful, and her figure became even more curvaceous…</p>
<p>By the side, Ranran was also stunned. This… isn’t this a drastic change in appearance? Hearing Ranran’s words, Qiu Xier immediately took out a small bronze mirror she carried with her. When she saw her reflection in the mirror clearly, she couldn’t believe it, so she hurriedly walked to the nearby water puddle to see her reflection, immediately astonished and unable to believe, she knelt down by the water, she trembled as she touched her face and said, “How…how did I become so beautiful? I’ve turned into an unparalleled beauty!”</p>
<p>But when she moved farther away from the sea of flowers, her appearance gradually returned to normal. Qiu Xier tentatively walked back towards the sea of flowers, and her nose became more prominent again.</p>
<p>Looking at Gao Cang, after he inhaled some pollen and emitted a red light all over, he felt heat rising in his dantian, with a feeling of surging spiritual energy. So he shouted strangely, waved his hand, and sent out a spiritual ball, hitting a distant big tree, which fell down with undeniable force.</p>
<p>Gao Cang also laughed ecstatically, ‘I’ve become stronger, did you see? I’ve become so powerful!’</p>
<p>However, when he joyfully moved away from the sea of flowers, the vitality in his dantian suddenly disappeared, and he could no longer split mountains or cut stones.</p>
<p>So, not believing in superstition, he stubbornly approached the sea of flowers again, breathing in the fragrance deeply.</p>
<p>Ranran looked at the scene in astonishment and asked urgently, ‘Shifu, what’s happening to them?’</p>
<p>Su Yishui frowned and said, ‘This pollen seems to stimulate a person’s potential, satisfying their deepest desires…’</p>
<p>Ranran widened her eyes as she listened because she noticed that third senior sister’s appearance had become somewhat like Elder Mu’s. Becoming a beauty that overshadowed others was indeed third senior sister’s greatest wish.</p>
<p>But could these flowers have such effects? Wouldn’t everyone fight over them? Why did that old herder warn against approaching these flowers earlier?</p>
<p>Just then, Su Yishui said, ‘Quickly get them out of there. Otherwise, inhaling too much pollen might lead to addiction, and they’ll become slaves to these demonic flowers.’</p>
<p>Yu Tong and Yu Chen also blocked their nostrils with the pills Ranran gave them and covered their mouths with cloth, holding their breath as they flew into the sea of flowers to pull Gao Cang and Qiu Xier out. Qiu Xier’s appearance once again became ordinary, while Gao Cang’s divine skills disappeared instantly.</p>
<p>Both of them were somewhat unwilling. Even though they heard Shifu say that the pollen was malevolent, they kept looking back at the sea of Eagle Beak Demon flowers after being pulled away by Ranran .</p>
<p>Su Yishui waved his hand and set up a spiritual shield to cover the sea of flowers, preventing the scent from leaking out.</p>
<p>These demonic flowers were a sign of the entrance to the Netherworld Realm. However, looking around, other than the endless strange red flowers, there was nothing else abnormal, and no entrance to the Realm could be found.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When the four of them returned to the town, Zeng Yi heard the strangeness of those demonic flowers and couldn’t help but worry, ‘Since they’re so malevolent, it’s better to destroy them as soon as possible.’</p>
<p>Su Yishui shook his head and said, ‘Even if these flowers are burned, they’ll bloom as usual the next day. They’ll be in full bloom for seven days before disappearing on their own.’</p>
<p>Ranran blinked and said, ‘So we must find the entrance to the Netherworld Realm within seven days, or else we won’t know when it will appear again?’</p>
<p>Su Yishui took out the Netherworld Realm key and said in a low voice, ‘All things that carry Yin while embracing Yang. Noon is when Yang is at its peak and Yin begins to grow. The time the flowers bloomed today should be exactly noon, so tomorrow at noon, we’ll go back to the sea of flowers.’</p>
<p>Ranran nodded, intending to call third senior sister to cook with her. But when she turned to look at Qiu Xier, she found her staring blankly at a small bronze mirror, lost in thought.</p>
<p>Ranran called her several times before Qiu Xier came to her senses. She pointed to her eyes and said, ‘Ranran, do you see that my eyes have become much larger than before?’</p>
<p>Ranran looked carefully and said, ‘No, they’re still the same size.’</p>
<p>Qiu Xier became anxious, ‘Are you not looking carefully? They’ve clearly increased in size!’</p>
<p>Ranran couldn’t argue and could only say, ‘Okay, they’ve gotten much bigger, alright, let’s go cook.’</p>
<p>Qiu Xier finally showed a happy expression. When they entered the small kitchen, she said, ‘Today, I only inhaled a bit of pollen, and my eyes became larger. Do you think if I inhaled more, my appearance will improve a lot?’</p>
<p>Ranran looked up alertly and said seriously, ‘Didn’t you hear what Shifu said? Those flowers are evil. Sniffing their pollen and having your appearance change, aren’t you afraid?’</p>
<p>Qiu Xier felt a bit disappointed, pouting and playing with the firewood, muttering, ‘Talking to someone as naturally beautiful as you, you wouldn’t understand. You don’t know how much I hope to become more and more beautiful like you.’</p>
<p>The current Ranran wasn’t the frail and weak girl she was when she first arrived on the mountain. Her fully blossomed dazzling beauty at eighteen was truly enviable.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier thought her parents didn’t give her a good foundation and didn’t have much expectations. But unexpectedly, just by inhaling a bit of pollen today, it was like being reborn, and her appearance suddenly became much more radiant.</p>
<p>As for Gao Cang, he also seemed rather restless. While everyone was eating at the table, he was lifting dumbbells in the yard, muttering that his strength seemed to have increased significantly.</p>
<p>Second senior brother Bai Baishan did not go to the sea of flowers because he was working on new weapons with Uncle Master Zeng in the horse stables. But seeing the two of them acting strangely, he couldn’t help but feel fortunate that he hadn’t gone.</p>
<p>He had been bewitched before, mistaking a burly man with black hair for the beauty Rou’er. He knew very well the feeling of being ensnared by illusions. If he got bewitched again, there would be no hope of returning to Xishan.</p>
<p>That night was uneventful. As usual, Su Yishui had to go to the mountains to be locked with chains before nightfall when the demonic nature rose.</p>
<p>That time Ranran accompanied him in the mountains for a night, and the next day, her clothes had been damp from the morning dew, so Su Yishui ordered her not to go anymore. Otherwise, she might disturb his concentration at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>So even though Ranran couldn’t sleep, she could only obediently stay at the horse stables.</p>
<p>By nightfall, she still couldn’t sleep peacefully. She tossed and turned on her bed, and finally, she got up and prepared to meditate and cultivate her vitality.</p>
<p>These past few days, she could finally handle two swords steadily, but there was still a considerable gap from handling five swords…</p>
<p>As she quietly recited the breathing technique and circulated the qi in her dantian, she suddenly heard movement from the next room.</p>
<p>Ranran had remarkable hearing when meditating, and she immediately recognized that the noise was coming from Qiu Xier’s room.</p>
<p>At first, she didn’t pay attention, thinking that third senior sister was just getting up to go to the toilet. But in a moment, she heard moaning sounds.</p>
<p>Ranran frowned upon hearing it, immediately opening her eyes. When she stepped outside, she happened to see senior brother Gao Cang just scaling the wall.</p>
<p>When Ranran called out to him from behind, he didn’t even turn his head.</p>
<p>Ranran knew something was very wrong and quickly leaped over the wall, chasing after the two ahead of her.</p>
<p>Among the disciples of Xishan, Ranran was the best at light body techniques. In theory, she should have been able to catch up with the two early on.</p>
<p>However, Gao Cang and Qiu Xier seemed to have some kind of extraordinary speed today, as if blessed by a divine force, making it impossible for Ranran to catch up no matter how hard she tried.</p>
<p>In the hazy moonlight, their bodies seemed to emit a faint red light, looking extremely eerie.</p>

<p>Ranran gave chase for a while, then stopped and turned back to call for help from her two Yu uncle masters.</p>
<p>If she guessed right, Gao Cang and Qiu Xier must have run into the sea of flowers.</p>
<p>Right now, their Shifu was in the mountains battling the demonic influence. If something went wrong, she wouldn’t be able to handle it alone.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Ranran’s urgent explanation, the two uncle masters quickly grabbed their cloaks and hurried towards the flower sea.</p>
<p>Upon arriving, under the dim moonlight, they saw Gao Cang and Qiu Xier cutting their wrists and pouring fresh blood onto the spiritual shield set up by Su Yishui.</p>
<p>As the blood flowed onto it, the flowers within the shield seemed to grow wildly, pollen filled the air, red mist spread, and eventually the shield actually broke, dispersing with the wind.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier and Gao Cang acted as if they had taken some life-saving elixir, desperately breathing in heavily and heading deeper into the flower sea without looking back.</p>
<p>Although Yu Chen and Yu Tong had covered their noses, they didn’t dare to get too close to the flower sea.</p>
<p>When Su Yishui said to enter at noon, it was not just because it was the time of yin-yang alternation but also because the yin energy was not strong during that time.</p>
<p>But now it was midnight, when yin energy was at its peak, and the eagle-beaked flowers have grown much larger than they were during the day. Each flower looked like a giant eagle’s head, half-opened and eerie.</p>
<p>They weren’t sure if they could protect themselves once inside the flower sea.</p>
<p>At that moment, Ranran pulled out two short swords that Uncle Master Zeng Yi had just crafted for her, infused them with her energy, and charged straight towards the two running ahead.</p>
<p>Yu Tong gasped, thinking Ranran was going to “stab them through the heart.”</p>
<p>However, after the swords flew out, they hit Gao Cang and Qiu Xier’s acupoints with the hilt, knocking them down and immobilizing them.</p>
<p>At this point, Ranran was ready to enter the flower sea and pull the two back. But Yu Tong grabbed her and said, “You can’t go in. These flowers are too sinister. If something happens to you too, Yu Chen and I won’t be able to handle you.”</p>
<p>Ranran’s cultivation was now much higher than Yu Tong’s, and if Ranran encountered trouble, they wouldn’t know what to do.</p>
<p>So for now, they could only let Gao Cang and Qiu Xier lie there like this. When dawn broke, they would figure out a way to get them out.</p>
<p>Yu Chen took a rope from his waist, ready to lasso them and see if they could pull them back.</p>
<p>At that moment, a strong wind blew, and Ranran saw the pollen spreading above the flower sea without the shield, realizing this was very bad!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Before long, many blue fireflies appeared around the flower sea.</p>
<p>But Ranran felt her hairs stand on end. She whispered, “Are those… not fireflies?”</p>
<p>Yu Chen had experience from his time on the border and whispered back, “Those are the eyes of wild wolves!”</p>
<p>It turned out the pollen attracted wild wolves from the wilderness. These wolves, one after another, with their blue eyes, howled and lunged towards them.</p>
<p>As wild animals, their greatest desire should be meat. And now, here by the flower sea, they were their sumptuous night feast.</p>
<p>Ordinary wild wolves wouldn’t approach people with foundation in cultivation no matter how fierce they were. Wild animals were quite intelligent; they would sense danger and avoid those with spiritual protection.</p>
<p>But after inhaling the pollen, these wolves seemed to increase in speed and strength several times over, and their courage grew immensely.</p>
<p>Their instinct for hunting made them stronger, and the eagle-beaked flower pollen turned the wolf pack into reckless demonic wolves.</p>
<p>As the wolves surrounded and attacked, they seemed utterly fearless.</p>
<p>Soon, Yu Chen’s thighs and back were scratched bloody by the wolf claws.</p>
<p>Yu Tong activated her spiritual protection which barely withstood the wolf pack’s attacks, but her shoulders and arms were bitten by the ferocious wolves.</p>
<p>Ranran wielded her mechanical staff while controlling the two short swords with her energy, swiftly killing dozens of demonic wolves.</p>
<p>Perhaps in moments of crisis, humans could truly tap into their potential. Soon, Ranran drew out another short sword from her waist, and the airborne swords increased from two to three.</p>
<p>Though there were only three, their speed was fast enough to create a whirlwind of slashing, splattering wolf blood everywhere they passed.</p>
<p>Seeing they couldn’t gain an advantage, the wolves suddenly turned and ran towards the flower sea, seemingly drawn by something inside.</p>
<p>As the pollen spread faster, it also attracted flocks of iron-beaked ravens and similar creatures. They swarmed towards the flower sea, ignoring even Gao Cang and Qiu Xier lying there.</p>
<p>After Gao Cang and Qiu Xier regained consciousness, they stood up groggily, and struggled to follow the animals further into the flower sea.</p>
<p>Yu Chen quickly picked up the rope he had prepared and forcefully lassoed them, pulling them out of the flower sea like livestock.</p>
<p>This was not a place for them to remain for long. After getting these two out, they all hurried back to the town square.</p>
<p>The shield was down, and Ranran’s power wasn’t enough to set up a new one. They could only wait for Su Yishui to return and figure something out.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran was mindful and sent a message to inform General Qin Xuanjiu, telling the soldiers not to go near the city outskirts. Otherwise, with the pollen spreading, innocent people might get hurt.</p>
<p>After Gao Cang and Qiu Xier came to their senses, they still clamored to go back to that flower sea.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier cried out, “Let me go, just once, please!”</p>
<p>When they noticed that Ranran and the others were going to lock the gate, Gao Cang even started using chairs to smash the door, while Qiu Xier used her head to bump into senior uncle master. Clearly, both of them were behaving abnormally, going somewhat out of control.</p>
<p>In the end, it was the second uncle master who tied up these two crazed individuals to a hitching post in the courtyard, finally calming them down.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>And so they were tied up all night. The next day, right before dawn, there was a commotion at the city gate. Qin Xuanjiu suddenly arrived with people, smashing down the door of the Horse Trading Post.</p>
<p>He shouted as soon as he entered, “Where is Su Yishui? Did you people have something to do with those demon flowers in the countryside?”</p>
<p>It turned out that last night, some soldiers who went out of the city to set up camp were also enchanted by the dispersed pollen and entered that flower sea.</p>
<p>Just like Gao Cang and Qiu Xier, they were immediately entranced by the floral fragrance, experiencing various hallucinations and refusing to leave, completely intoxicated.</p>
<p>By the time they were discovered in the morning, their bodies had already been bitten by the bizarre plant’s petal-like bird beaks and pierced into their veins .</p>
<p>In addition to these soldiers, there were also many birds and beasts, all entangled by vines and turned into nourishment for the demon flowers without exception.</p>
<p>These plants fed on humans, using blood as fertilizer and their greed as nourishment. Those soldiers and animals trapped in the flower sea all perished.</p>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu initially invited Elder Mu to investigate, but Elder Mu only took a glance from afar and refused to approach, only saying that the residual spiritual field around the flower sea was set up by Su Yishui, so he should look for Su Yishui.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu had seen these flowers before, but at that time, they only caused illusions and didn’t actively entangle people or drain them as ruthlessly as they did now.</p>
<p>These demon flowers were too terrifying, so naturally, Su Yishui gets the blame for them. Hence, Qin Xuanjiu came aggressively to find him.</p>
<p>However, as soon as he entered, he was startled by Gao Cang and Qiu Xier, who were tied to the courtyard pillar.</p>
<p>Has XiShan really become a demonic sect, using such sinister methods to discipline disciples?</p>
<p>However, upon hearing Ranran’s explanation that they did not plant those flowers, Qin Xuanjiu was not entirely convinced, especially with the residual spiritual shield set up by Su Yishui around the flower sea.</p>
<p>Ranran couldn’t understand and asked, “Didn’t I send someone to inform the General last night? Why did soldiers still enter the flower sea?”</p>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu was suddenly at a loss for words. He did receive a message from Ranran yesterday. However, at that time, he was meditating with his Master. When his Master heard about it, she asked Qin Xuanjiu to send someone to investigate what Ranran and the others were up to.</p>
<p>So Qin Xuanjiu had sent people, but he didn’t expect such a disastrous result.</p>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu regretted it deeply now. Being questioned by Ranran like this, his face turned liver-colored, unable to respond. Unfortunately, he couldn’t go back to confront his Master, so for a moment, he only thought about seeking death to atone.</p>
<p>So he immediately drew his sword, shouting to cut his throat. Yu Chen was so angry that he wanted to kick him away, telling him to go far away from the Horse Trading Post before killing himself, so as not to ruin the Trading Post’s business.</p>
<p>Just when the courtyard was in chaos, Zeng Yi, covered in mud, had run back in a hurry, “Its…..very bad…… Junior brother Su has broken free from the chains and has headed towards that flower sea!”</p>
<p>It turned out that last night, Su Yishui’s demonic nature had reached its peak, breaking free from both the iron chains and the golden talismans.</p>
<p>Zeng Yi watched helplessly as he broke the chains and rushed away roaring, and the direction he was headed was the flower sea in the countryside.</p>
<p>Ranran knew clearly that if Shifu entered the flower sea while he was not in a clear state of mind, and accidentally inhaled the pollen, he would likely be controlled by the demon flowers and become their nourishment.</p>
<p>So she didn’t have time to deal with Qin Xuanjiu’s nonsense. She turned around, and took off towards the countryside.</p>
<p>Except for Gao Cang and Qiu Xier, who were still tied to the courtyard pillar, everyone else, including Qin Xuanjiu, also followed after her.</p>
<p>Ranran was proficient in light body techniques, far outstripping the others.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When she arrived at the flower sea, she saw a tall man standing in the center of the flower sea from afar.</p>
<p>At this time, the man’s hair crown had completely loosened, his long hair and white clothes dancing in the wind. With thick eyebrows and deep eyes, he appeared devilish, the midday sun shining on the red pollen, giving off a strange light, making him seem like a demon god who has descended.</p>
<p>Ranran shouted loudly, “Shifu!”</p>
<p>The man slowly turned his gaze towards her and suddenly rushed towards her like lightning.</p>
<p>When cultivators reach a certain realm, their bodies automatically generate spiritual shields.</p>
<p>Ranran was no exception. Although she didn’t want to guard against Shifu, her body’s instincts had already reacted, summoning the shield to repel Su Yishui.</p>
<p>However, this unintentional defense completely infuriated the man who is now under demonic influences, as he felt that the girl was going to distance herself from him.</p>
<p>Before Ranran could even react, she was firmly grasped by him, and her spiritual shield was shattered.</p>
<p>Moreover, the force he used to grip her was not controlled at all, causing Ranran to cry out in pain.</p>
<p>But even so, the man kept increasing the force, while his thin lips screamed in Ranran’s ear, “Did you think you can escape me by dying? I want you to follow me to hell!”</p>
<p>Ranran tried to relax herself as much as possible, weakening the instinctive shield, while softly saying, “Okay, wherever you are, I will go with you…”</p>
<p>After speaking, she leaned over and kissed the man’s cold thin lips.</p>
<p>This kiss, was gentle and sweet, miraculously calming down Su Yishui’s mania once again, the thick black aura on his body visibly weakening.</p>
<p>She didn’t know why, but Ranran just knew that this man, no matter how demonic he became, would never harm her.</p>
<p>Because when she dove into the flower sea just now, the man had instinctively extended his spirit shield to envelop her, to prevent her from being harmed by the demon flowers.</p>
<p>Other than the Spirit Spring sealed within him, it seemed that any indication of her distancing herself from him would also drive him into madness.</p>
<p>So Ranran could only cling to her master tightly like a little gecko, not being apart for even a moment.</p>
<p>But to the onlookers, it looked like Su Yishui was going mad, assaulting his female disciple.</p>
<p>Especially that shout just now, was like a blatant threat!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Just as the two were embracing in the flower sea, suddenly a long whip lashed out: “Demon son! Let go of Ranran!”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu from Crimson Gate had appeared at the edge of the flower sea at some unknown time, and he immediately moved to rescue Xue Ranran who was being “held hostage” by her demonized master.</p>
<p>Seeing that Su Yishui seemed to have lost control to his demonic nature, Wei Jiu’s heart was actually filled with mixed emotions.</p>
<p>On one hand, he didn’t want Su Yishui to further enhance his spiritual power using the Spirit Spring, becoming invincible.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he felt that this Su Yishui, exposed so completely before Xue Ranran, must make her both frightened and angry, and she probably wished to rid herself of such a master at once.</p>
<p>At this moment, his timely appearance to play the hero and save the beauty was just right!</p>
<p>So, despite knowing the strangeness of the flower sea, Wei Jiu, relying on his skill and courage, rushed forward, wanting to snatch Ranran from Su Yishui’s embrace.</p>
<p>However, as the long whip flew, countless eagle-beaked demonic flowers were struck, causing the pollen that had settled to fly again, creating a red pollen mist in the sky above the flower sea.</p>
<p>When Wei Jiu stepped into it, he clearly felt the magnetic field change. After absorbing the blood and vitality of countless people, those flowers became even more enchanting.</p>
<p>Vines climbed and extended, forming strange patterns. Ranran who was in Su Yishui’s arms as they rose into the air, looked down and realized that the patterns on the ground of the flower sea looked very similar to her master’s netherworld realm key.</p>
<p>She looked up at Su Yishui, the redness in his eyes had not yet dissipated, but the force with which he held her seemed to have greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Ranran pulled her hand out from his embrace and felt for the key from his body. Comparing the two, the totem composed of demonic flowers on the ground was exactly the same as the key.</p>
<p>At this moment, Su Yishui, while dodging Wei Jiu’s attacks with Ranran in his arms, lowered his head and asked her, “These flowers seem to resonate with the Spiritual Spring inside me. Last night’s resonance was particularly strong, causing me to momentarily lose control… Did I hurt you just now?”</p>
<p>It seemed that he had finally regained his sanity. Ranran whispered softly, “No, but the pollen is spreading too quickly. I’m afraid people from nearby villages will also be drawn into the flower sea.”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu also gradually stopped his attacks. He also sensed the strangeness of the flower sea, and among his disciples, there were those who had entered the flower sea without holding their breath, and soon lost their reason and being firmly bitten by the eagle-beaked flowers, absorbing their spiritual energy and flesh…</p>
<p>Although these eagle-beaked flowers had appeared before, they weren’t as aggressive as they were now.</p>
<p>Perhaps after losing the Spirit Spring for a long time, the Netherworld Realm’s aura had deviated, causing the demonic flowers from the Netherworld Realm to autonomously absorb the life force of beasts and humans, replenishing their own declining power. At the same time, because they sensed the Spirit Spring on Su Yishui’s body, they actively opened the doors to the Realm.</p>
<p>That’s why those eagle-beaked flowers became so aggressive, absorbing people’s life force and etching the key engraving onto the ground.</p>
<p>This was also why Su Yishui had lost control and entered the flower sea.</p>
<p>For the first time in a thousand years, the Netherworld Realm wasn’t opened from the outside, but actively connected with the human realm.</p>
<p>The vines began to emit red light. With this light becoming brighter, the earth began to tremble and crack, the entire flower sea sinking and turning into a bottomless abyss. Ranran tightly held her Shifu’s hand. If they had to venture into the Netherworld Realm, then as she said, wherever Su Yishui went, she would go with him!</p>
<p>However, Su Yishui didn’t think so. When he regained his rationality, his first instinct before being sucked into the Netherworld Realm was to throw Ranran out.</p>
<p>But how could Ranran, this little gecko, be easily shaken off? Clinging tightly to his neck, she fiercely said, “Don’t you leave me behind!”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>In the next instant, the two were sucked into the collapsing pit together.</p>
<p>At the moment they were sucked in, another figure followed suit, flying down with them and falling together with the two of them.</p>
<p>Ranran could clearly see that the sudden black shadow was Wei Jiu from Crimson Gate.</p>
<p>He must have been planning for a long time, waiting for the moment when the Netherworld Realm opened wide, and follow Su Yishui into the Realm. Behind him was the elder Tu Jiuyuan who also followed into the fissure.</p>
<p>As the sun in the sky shifted, the flowers on the ground withered in an instant, and the cracked earth quickly closed up. Apart from the four people disappearing into thin air, everything else returned to how it was before the red flowers bloomed.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>……</p>
<p>Speaking of Wei Jiu, he hadn’t expected that Tu Jiuyuan would also jump down with them. Originally preparing to compete with Su Yishui for Ranran, he couldn’t help but despise Tu Jiuyuan for being meddlesome.</p>
<p>The abyss of the Netherworld Realm had no bottom. Once fallen into it, one would be corroded by decaying gas and turn into a demonic corpse. Therefore, Su Yishui also didn’t want to engage with Wei Jiu. He just held onto Ranran tightly and hung on to the cliff wall nearby.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu had the same thought as he did. He had planned to take advantage of Su Yishui’s unpreparedness to snatch Ranran and pull her into <em>his</em> arms.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Wei Jiu was just a tad too slow and failed to grab Ranran. He could only turn around and grab Tu Jiuyuan, who was falling, and also hung onto the cliff wall.</p>
<p>Although he caught Tu Jiuyuan, his words were sharp and malicious: “You meddler, who allowed you to come down?”</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan pursed her lips and whispered, “I am willing to accompany my lord through fire and water without complaint…”</p>
<p>At this time, men and women from Xishan and Crimson Gate each occupied one side of the cliff wall. Because they were still quite a distance apart, they temporarily ceased hostilities.</p>
<p>Ranran finally manged to calm herself and take in their current surroundings.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of the Netherworld Realm was completely different from the human realm. Here, it seemed that the energies of yin and yang were reversed. The water on the cliffs didn’t flow downwards but swirled upwards, constantly floating and rising like pearls.</p>
<p>Above them, there was a winding river flowing upside down.</p>
<p>Ranran wiped the water off her face and looked at the large river above her head with some shock.</p>
<p>Su Yishui caught his breath and whispered, “Hold onto me tightly, don’t fall down!”</p>
<p>Ranran quickly held onto him tightly and then asked, “Shifu, is this the Netherworld Realm? Are we going down there later?” Strange cries seemed to come from the depths beneath their feet, and there was no idea what was down there.</p>
<p>Su Yishui shook his head and pointed to the rolling river above: “No, we have to climb up.”</p>
<p>The Netherworld Realm is different from the human realm; water can flow upwards. So, if they wanted to reach the part of the cliff where the water fell, they could only keep climbing upwards.</p>
<p>However, they were all living beings. When their yang bodies entered the Netherworld Realm, it felt like they were carrying heavy iron, making every movement extremely difficult. Even with high spiritual power, their actions became much slower.</p>
<p>Thus, the two couples had no choice but stop fighting and each started climbing up the cliff.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu sneered at Su Yishui and shouted, “Su Yishui, you can’t suppress the Spirit Spring. Why not just hand it over to me soon? That way, you’ll be much more relaxed.”</p>
<p>Ranran looked at Wei Jiu and said, “How shameless. You can suppress the Spirit Spring? Did you replenish your spiritual power that was consumed by the Immortal Devouring bugs at Tianmai Mountain?”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu hated it most when others looked down on his abilities. Hearing this, he immediately felt embarrassed and angry.</p>
<p>He looked at Ranran, smiled coldly and stopped talking, focusing on climbing up.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Because the Yin forces from the chasm was increasing in strength, if they stayed on the cliff wall for too long, they might be sucked into the endless abyss.</p>
<p>Seeing that her Shifu was struggling, Ranran tried reaching out to climb the cliff herself. She thought she would climb slowly after hearing Shifu’s explanation, but to her surprise, when she tried to ascend using her qi, she climbed a considerable distance effortlessly.</p>
<p>When she looked back at the other three struggling to climb, she felt like she was watching sloths and turtles.</p>
<p>And those three also gazed at her in disbelief.</p>
<p>So, Ranran climbed back down easily, got close to Shifu and whispered, “Is it really this difficult? Why don’t I feel anything?”</p>
<p>“You are not made of ordinary flesh but had been a fruit growing on a tree. The Rebirth Tree inherently belong to Yin, so when you’re in the Netherworld Realm, you naturally won’t suffer like us…”</p>
<p>Before Su Yishui could reply, Wei Jiu readily provided the explanation.</p>
<p>He had just had an unpleasant exchange with Ranran earlier, but now that he had calmed down a little, he was eager to ease the tension.</p>
<p>It had been quite some time since he had seen this little girl, Ranran. Now that he looked at her, it seemed like she had grown a little more. Her long hair, wet from the rising water on the cliff, clung to her snowy cheeks, and her big eyes were very lively.</p>
<p>He should have noticed long ago that her eyes were exactly the same as those of Mu Qingge in her past life.</p>
<p>Thinking back to when he was at Tianmai Mountain, he kept hanging around that imposter in front of Ranran, Excellency Wei felt that this little girl who was now a little hostile towards him, using some harsh words which can be forgiven.</p>
<p>He wouldn’t argue with her, lest Su Yishui take advantage.</p>
<p>But in Ranran’s eyes, Wei Jiu’s belated solicitousness seemed rather untimely, much like those sudden letters he sent to Tianmai Mountain, presumptuous and self-righteous.</p>
<p>So when Wei Jiu spoke, she didn’t look at him but instead turned to her Shifu.</p>
<p>Su Yishui patted her back and said, “Since you can climb fast, hurry up and go up. Wait for me on the riverbank.”</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">道出真相 THE TRUTH IS OUT</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Seeing that Shifu didn’t refute and just urged her to go up, Ranran knew that what Wei Jiu said should be mostly true.</p>
<p>She didn’t expect her Wood attribute to be so useful in the Netherworld Realm.</p>
<p>However, she did not climb up by herself. Instead she grabbed her master’s hand and pulled him quickly forward, leaving Wei Jiu and Tuo Jiuyuan far below.</p>
<p>She noticed that the black lines on her master’s neck has nearly circled around it, indicating that they needed to reach the cliff where the water fell soon to restore the Spirit Spring.</p>
<p>But she didn’t notice that the constantly rising water droplets have wet her clothes.</p>
<p>Su Yishui was very close to her at this moment. When she turned back to pull him up, her collar opened slightly, revealing her alluring white neck and collarbones.</p>
<p>Su Yishui needed to close his eyes and adjust his breath to suppress the surge of demonic impulses inside him. How was he going to climb fast?</p>
<p>But Ranran became faster and faster as they went, almost pulling Su Yishui up quickly in the end.</p>
<p>On the other side of the cliff, Wei Jiu also stopped talking. His objective here was clear: either obtain the Spirit Spring or take advantage of Su Yishui’s weakness after he stripped the Spirit Spring from himself, to kill him in one blow.</p>
<p>If the two tasks could be combined, it would be well worth the trip.</p>
<p>Although he had come here last time with a key, the Netherworld Realm was a dry land back then, weak in Yin energy, completely different from now.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because Su Yishui brought back the Spirit Spring that the Yin energy in the Realm surged, and the water flow rose rapidly. Wei Jiu found it quite difficult to climb.</p>
<p>Seeing the two on the opposite cliff climbing faster and faster, Wei Jiu no longer cared about Tuo Jiuyuan behind him. His arm veins bulged as he tried hard to speed up and catch up.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran and Su Yishui arrived first to the cliff of falling water above them.</p>
<p>However, diving into the upside-down riverbed was another difficult task. Just as Ranran reached out to touch the water, Su Yishui stopped her with his hand.</p>
<p>“Don’t touch it. The boundary of the falling water will only dissipate every two hours. Otherwise, we won’t be able to pass.” After speaking, he took out a handkerchief and threw it into the river.</p>
<p>Before the handkerchief touched the water surface, it seemed to touch something and instantly turned into ashes.</p>
<p>It was still far from two hours passing. Ranran looked around and unexpectedly found a recessed mountain hollow on the cliff, where they could rest and wait quietly.</p>
<p>As they entered the hollow, the two people on the opposite cliff also disappeared from sight.</p>
<p>Ranran shook her wet hair, wiped the water droplets off her face, and was about to speak when Su Yishui pulled her into his arms and started to kiss her passionately.</p>
<p>He had wanted to kiss her badly since just now, but thinking of Wei Jiu nearby, he had been enduring it.</p>
<p>After being kissed, Ranran would look a little dazed, with her blushing red cheeks she looked absolutely adorable. He didn’t want to let Wei Jiu get a free feast with his eyes.</p>
<p>Ranran wrapped her arms around his neck in response, and after their passionate kiss, she whispered softly against his lips, “Will you return to normal after returning the Spirit Spring, Shifu?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui’s arms around her waist tightened involuntarily. “Do you want things to return to normal?”</p>
<p>Ranran actually didn’t want to. These days, she and her Shifu were always close, even when they were silent under the moonlight, there seemed to be a subtle rapport.</p>
<p>But she also knew that her Shifu’s original temperament should be cold and somewhat distant. If it weren’t for the Spirit Spring, he wouldn’t never have taken an interest in a silly little girl like her.</p>
<p>Could she cling onto Shifu because of this critical period and force him to take responsibility?</p>
<p>However, thinking about a future where she had to pretend to get along with her Shifu as if nothing had ever happened, was really agonizing.</p>
<p>Perhaps after this, Shifu might feel uncomfortable around her, then she should really leave Xishan,  and leave her Shifu.</p>
<p>Now that she knew the root cause of her illness, which was because she didn’t grow to maturity on the Rebirth Tree, as long as her master allowed her to take the Rebirth Tree planted in the small courtyard of Western Mountain with her, she could rely on the small tree to sustain her life. This way, she wouldn’t make her master doubt her and think that he would have to take responsibility for these absurd days.</p>
<p>However, she wouldn’t say any of these. After all, her Shifu couldn’t handle any talk of her leaving him at the moment.</p>
<p>So when Su Yishui asked, she slowly leaned her face against his chest, listening to his steady heartbeat, and said half-truthfully, “Of course, I hope you return to normal. Then we can take the newly made lanterns to catch fireflies…”</p>
<p>Su Yishui reached out to touch her long hair, and also slowly closed his eyes. Amidst the rushing sound of the rising water, the two of them leaned serenely against each other, as if this was not the gloomy and terrifying Netherworld Realm.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Unfortunately, there would always be someone who ruins the mood.</p>
<p>Apparently, they were not the only ones who discovered this wonderful place. Before long, the sound of water being struck suddenly echoed, and Wei Jiu, using his extendable long whip, also leaped over from the opposite side.</p>
<p>He and Tuo Jiuyuan also wanted to take shelter here for a while.</p>
<p>Because the terrain here was narrow, if they fought, there was a high chance that they would both fall off the cliff. So Su Yishui and Wei Jiu each occupied one side.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu looked at the black lines on Su Yishui’s neck that were exposed, chuckled strangely twice, and said, “Why bother suppressing it with such difficulty? You used to be the imposing Demon son, capable of doing anything with the Spirit Spring. Is it because you want to appear like a good person before Ranran, fearing that she will remember your past shortcomings?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui slowly opened his eyes, which were tinged with a faint red light, and glared at him with a sinister look. “If you say another word, I will fulfill your wish, activate the power of the Spirit Spring, and kill you as easily as killing a stink bug.”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu knew that Su Yishui was not bluffing. It was really not beneficial to anger him just then.</p>
<p>He shifted his gaze to Ranran again, teasingly saying, “Back then at Tianmai Mountain, if I had known that Mu Qingge was an imposter, I would have treated you nicer…”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran was originally meditating with her eyes closed and ignored Wei Jiu. However, after hearing his words, Ranran couldn’t help but open her eyes abruptly and looked at Wei Jiu with uncertainty.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>What did he mean when he said Mu Qingge was an imposter?</p>
<p>These days, she had also thought about her past life. Mu Qingge had been ambushed by her sister, Mu Ranwu, who grabbed her waist and allowed other sect leaders to successfully attack her.</p>
<p>So every time she thought that she might be Mu Ranwu, Ranran felt a little guilty. Regardless of whether Mu Qingge was good or evil, it was an undeniable fact that Mu Ranwu caused Mu Qingge’s death. </p>
<p>This was also why Ranran yielded to Mu Qingge again and again.</p>
<p>But now, Wei Jiu suddenly mentioned such words. Mu Qingge is an imposter?</p>
<p>Ranran had always been intelligent. In a moment of clarity, she suddenly realized something she had never dared to think before—perhaps she… was actually Mu Qingge, the master of her mentor!</p>
<p>However, this absurd truth was rather difficult to accept. Her mind swirled in chaotic thoughts, and she couldn’t help but turn to look at Su Yishui.</p>
<p>Did……he always know that she was Mu Qingge? Or was there some misunderstanding?</p>
<p>Wei Jiu had thought that Su Yishui should have informed Ranran of the truth already. When they were on opposite cliffs just now, he could see clearly through the water curtain that Su Yishui was kissing Ranran.</p>
<p>He originally thought that Su Yishui had somehow weaved lies, carefully covering up all of his scheming in her past life.</p>
<p>But now it would seem that Su Yishui hadn’t revealed Ranran’s true identity to her yet.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Wei Jiu understood everything perfectly now. He couldn’t help but laugh loudly, “What? Su Yishui didn’t tell you the truth? That’s right, how could he have the nerve to say it? If he told that you are actually Mu Qingge, wouldn’t he have to explain all the schemes he had against you in your past life? Why do you think Mu Ranwu betrayed you and framed you? Isn’t it all his manipulations, stirring up discord between you and your sister, using his charm to seduce Mu Ranwu to betray you? I told you, he’s very evil! Now that he is under the banner of righteousness, has his pretense really made him into a good person? Using your memory loss to transform himself into your master, but not respecting the master-disciple relationship, seducing an ignorant little girl like you. Hahaha, the imperial Su family is full of hypocrites…”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu didn’t have a chance to say more. Because Su Yishui had already burst out in anger, roaring with red eyes, and exerted all his spiritual power towards Wei Jiu.</p>
<p>Tuo Jiuyuan had long sensed that Su Yishui was not right, and hurriedly shouted, “Your Excellency, get out of the way!”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu also sensed that Su Yishui was somewhat out of control. This fierce attack clearly mobilized the power of the Spirit Spring, roaring like an evil dragon as he came over.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu had deliberately provoked Su Yishui.</p>
<p>The power of the Spirit Spring was indeed terrifying. However, if the person possessed by the Spirit Spring went berserk, they would be devoured by it, and during the moment of soul consumption, there would be a brief period of stupor before the Spirit Spring took over completely. Su Yishui would then completely lose his soul and become a puppet of the Spirit spring. Wei Jiu had a new bottle and gold talisman made by Elder Jiu.</p>
<p>As long as he waited for the moment when Su Yishui completely loses control, he could seize the opportunity, and extract and seal the Spirit Spring from him. By then, Su Yishui would become a useless person with an incomplete soul. He would then slowly kill this nemesis as Ranran watched.</p>
<p>So when Su Yishui rushed over, he had already taken out the new bottle and gold talisman, ready to subdue Su Yishui and reseal the Spirit spring.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no matter how much he had considered every possibility, he didn’t expect Su Yishui’s self-control to be so strong that he wasn’t completely under the influence of the Spirit Spring.</p>
<p>The golden talisman he held was also slapped away by Su Yishui’s palm, and the talisman bottle couldn’t withstand the onslaught of spiritual energy and shattered with a crack.</p>
<p>The terrain in the mountain hollow was narrow, and Wei Jiu saw that his ambush had failed. Trying to dodge again was too late; he could only urgently mobilize his spiritual power shield to resist Su Yishui’s thunderous strike.</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan suddenly raised her spiritual shield and rushed straight to the front of Wei Jiu, taking Su Yishui’s furious blow for him.</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan’s cultivation in the Crimson Gate was second only to Wei Jiu, but even so, her raised spiritual shield was shattered by Su Yishui’s blow. The sound of her bones cracking could even be heard, and at that moment, blood gushed out. If it were in the human realm and one suffered such a serious injury, there might be a chance of survival with a deep enough foundation. But this was the Netherworld Realm; once injured, it was like a flood bursting a dam, blood and true qi would accelerate leaving the body.</p>
<p>Ranran hurriedly blocked in front of Su Yishui.</p>
<p>She wasn’t trying to save Tu Jiuyuan; she was just afraid that Su Yishui would continue killing in a rage, causing him to be completely controlled by the Spirit Spring and be trapped in the Netherworld Realm forever.</p>
<p>Su Yishui also understood this. Wei Jiu had likely provoked him deliberately earlier. If he had unleashed the full power of the Spirit Spring, even Ranran wouldn’t be spared.</p>
<p>If she were really injured, he would probably completely lose control…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Wei Jiu also felt resentful, feeling that the perfect opportunity had been missed just now. If Tu Jiuyuan had attacked earlier instead of blocking in front of him, perhaps the talisman bottle wouldn’t have shattered!</p>
<p>Watching his long-time bedside companion and loyal subordinate lying in the mountain hollow, coughing up blood, Wei Jiu disdainfully glared at her and said, “Fool, did I ask you to meddle?”</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan was now lying limply in the mountain hollow, coughing up mouthfuls of blood, tears flowing continuously from her eyes.</p>
<p>After calming down Su Yishui, Ranran turned back to look at the appearance of the female demon Tu Jiuyuan, and couldn’t help but feel a little sympathetic.</p>
<p>She could see that although this elder Tu helped do evil things, she loved Wei Jiu very much. Sacrificing herself like this not only fulfilled her duty as a loyal subordinate but also sacrificed herself to save the man she loved.</p>
<p>But in the end, what she got in exchange for her life was Wei Jiu’s disdainful mockery. Ranran couldn’t stand it anymore.</p>
<p>She took out a medicine box from her pocket and threw it beside Tu Jiuyuan, saying, “This is a Heart-protecting pill. Take one quickly, or with so much blood loss, you might die soon.”</p>
<p>This female demon had committed many sins, but her sins would have their own consequences by the heavens. At this critical moment when her master’s demon nature was difficult to control, if he really killed Tu Jiuyuan, he would bear a heavy karmic debt, and his demonic nature would become even more uncontrollable.</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan looked at Ranran with a complicated expression, but seemed as if her spiritual power had been drained. She just cried and didn’t want to take the pill.</p>
<p>Ranran couldn’t help but angrily glare at Wei Jiu. “She sacrificed herself to save you like this, are you going to just watch her die? If you don’t feed it to her, are you expecting me to?”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu coldly snorted, then walked over and roughly pried open Tu Jiuyuan’s tightly closed mouth, stuffing the pill into her mouth.</p>
<p>This Heart-protecting pill was refined by Ranran and had much stronger effects than ordinary heart-protecting pills. Tu Jiuyuan finally managed to stop coughing up blood, but her body was already weak, and those shattered bones needed to be reset one by one for her to fully recover.</p>
<p>Ranran felt that after experiencing this life-threatening ordeal, perhaps the deep wounds in Elder Tu’s heart would be the most difficult to heal…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Love is misleading!</p>
<p>She don’t know why, but a sentence from third senior sister’s romance novels suddenly flashed through Ranran’s mind.</p>
<p>As for Wei Jiu’s words just now, she didn’t even want to think about them now.</p>
<p>They have more critical matters at hand, and who she was in her past life doesn’t matter right now. Restoring the Spirit Spring to its place is the priority, so she absolutely would not ask her master whether Wei Jiu’s words were true or not.</p>
<p>Calculating the time, it should have been about two hours now. When she turned around to check the river above her head, the barrier there had indeed weakened significantly.</p>
<p>So she turned around and said, “Shifu, we can cross the river now!”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu didn’t expect that after revealing such a shocking scene just now, although it had infuriated Su Yishui, Ranran, apart from the initial shock and confusion, quickly returned to normal, as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>His schemes fell through. He couldn’t help but sneer and say, “Have you become foolish growing on the tree? Are you lacking insight or do you think I’m lying to you?”</p>
<p>Ranran raised her chin slightly, saying coldly to him, “Excellency Wei, you’ve lived foolishly for so long, are you only concerned about yourself? This Spirit Spring isn’t a good entity; the eagle-beaked flowers blooming all over the mountains are evidence. You’re just blindly seeking strength, but have you ever thought about the imbalance in the world, the withering of all things? What good is it for you to become the only strong person in the land? We don’t want to fight you now. If you’re willing to assist my Shifu in returning the Spirit Spring, I believe all major sects will reconsider their views on your Crimson Gate. And Elder Tu has only temporarily stopped bleeding; she can’t delay for long in this Realm. You should be a good person occasionally and do some good deeds now and then. How about it?”</p>
<p>When Ranran rebuked him coldly, the two men in the mountain hollow were slightly shaken in their hearts. It seemed like for a moment, they saw that lofty and unrestrained woman in red once again.</p>
<p>She never put petty emotions like love in her heart. With a straightforward and clear conscience, solitary and quiet, seeming to treat everyone she knew warmly, yet none of them could hold onto her.</p>
<p>Even the truly wicked Wei Jiu couldn’t help but be impressed.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Su Yishui didn’t pay attention to Wei Jiu this time, silently walking out of the cave and following Ranran, heading towards the waterfall.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu felt a bit embarrassed, jumping in anger. He glanced coldly at Tu Jiuyuan, letting her wait here, then turned around and followed Su Yishui.</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan struggled to speak, “Excellency, please go about your business, don’t worry about me…”</p>
<p>But before she could finish her words, Wei Jiu had already left impatiently.</p>
<p>According to the records of the Fantian Sect, the Spirit Spring is below this waterfall. After Su Yishui had used Mu Qingge to open the gate to the Netherworld realm back then, he had been here before, so he was familiar with the way.</p>
<p>After Mu Qingge separated Su Yishui from the Spirit Spring and sealed it at Wangxiang Pass, entrusting it to Qin Xuanjiu to watch over. But when the Spirit Spring took an unexpected turn, she asked Qin Xuanjiu to look for Su Yishui to resolve the aftermath.</p>
<p>Su Yishui naturally understood the intention behind it.</p>
<p>That indifferent and carefree woman, even if she ended up being harmed by him in the end, still firmly believed that he could become a good person who could save the world.</p>
<p>So she entrusted Qin Xuanjiu to find him and then instructed him to return the Spirit Spring intact.</p>
<p>Su Yishui couldn’t think any more. The Spirit Spring inside his body seemed to sense that it was going to be returned and kept roaring restlessly: “Don’t send me back, the Netherworld Realm is cold and lifeless, how can it compare to the fun bustling world of mortals? I can make you stronger, didn’t you embrace Mu Qingge in your arms? A woman like her, once she knows your true nature, how could she fall in love with you? I will help you possess her, don’t send me back!”</p>
<p>The voice of the Spirit Spring became more arrogant and piercing. Su Yishui held his breath and closed his eyes, swiftly plunging into the falling water.</p>
<p>The falling water cleansed the dust of the mortal world, allowing one to reach the other side of the Netherworld Realm.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As Su Yishui jumped into the River of Forgetfulness, Wei Jiu suddenly took action, taking out a talisman and quickly pasting it towards Ranran.</p>
<p>The thunderous blow from Su Yishui just now finally made Wei Jiu realize how unrealistic his idea of controlling the Spirit Spring for himself was.</p>
<p>Since that was the case, then the evil thing should be returned. But he didn’t come to the Netherworld Realm just to be a guardian for Su Yishui.</p>
<p>The Soul-Cleansing Talisman from Elder Jiu was quite overbearing. Why not paste it on Ranran while Su Yishui was entering the water?</p>
<p>By that time, all memories related to Su Yishui could be erased from Ranran’s mind.</p>
<p>When he brings Ranran out of the Netherworld Realm, she would be cleansed of her past and reborn again.</p>
<p>So Wei Jiu seized the opportunity and slapped the Soul-Cleansing Talisman towards Ranran’s back.</p>
<p>But Ranran was not a fool and had been on guard against Wei Jiu. When she caught a glimpse of Wei Jiu’s movement from the corner of her eye, she immediately turned around agilely, avoiding Wei Jiu’s reaching hand.</p>
<p>However, Wei Jiu’s other hand grabbed her shoulder, and he swiftly lunged at her again like lightning.</p>
<p>When he was immersed in the Black Pool on Tianmai Mountain, it was a demonic water closely related to the Netherworld Realm. So when he entered this realm, he could move as lightly as Ranran.<br/><em>*But didn’t Su Yishui also went in the Black pool before? Or it was too long ago? Anywaay…</em></p>
<p>He had deliberately concealed his skills earlier, just to catch her off guard. Ranran was indeed lulled by him and didn’t dodge very cautiously.</p>
<p>Just as the Soul-Cleansing Talisman was about to hit Ranran, a hand suddenly reached out from the falling water and fiercely pulled Wei Jiu down.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu plunged into the water ignominiously. As he struggled fiercely, the Soul-Cleansing Talisman landed squarely on Su Yishui’s forehead.</p>
<p>The talisman touched his skin and melted into his pores. Stunned, Wei Jiu couldn’t help but curse in frustration.</p>
<p>But that talisman had not been easy to come by and should not be wasted. In a hurry, Wei Jiu could only quickly chant a spell to seal all of Su Yishui’s romantic feelings for Mu Qingge.</p>
<p>He had instructed Tu Jiuyuan to make Elder Jiu drink enough wine to extract information from him about the talisman, learning that it washed away extreme emotions of deep hatred and love but could not turn people into fools.</p>
<p>In hindsight, it was such a pity! But it was good to cleanse Su Yishui’s love of two lifetimes for both Mu Qingge and Xue Ranran!</p>
<p>The path was different but the end result was the same. If Su Yishui completely forgot about his belated love for Mu Qingge, he wouldn’t be entangled with Xue Ranran now?</p>
<p>So in the depths of the falling water, that talisman turned into a spiritual light and disappeared into Su Yishui’s forehead.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran had also jumped into the water and saw what happened. She swam vigorously towards Su Yishui, wanting to pull him up.</p>
<p>But Su Yishui’s body was attracted to the forces of the falling water and quickly sank, disappearing into the vortex.</p>
<p>Ranran also wanted to follow, but found that her body couldn’t sink into the riverbed no matter what, only feeling the water getting hotter.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu exclaimed inwardly. This was a sign of the Spirit Spring returning to its position. When the Spirit Spring returned completely, the entire falling water would become boiling water, so he quickly grabbed Ranran, took a deep breath, and climbed up the bank. Just as Wei Jiu climbed out of the falling water, Ranran pushed him back into the water with her stick.</p>
<p>“Tell me, what talisman did you paste on Shifu?”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu was anxious; this water was really burning his buttocks! It unexpectedly triggered his spiritual power, freeing him from the heavy constraints, and he jumped out of the water.</p>
<p>“Of course, I pasted something good. If he can come out of the water in time, you will naturally know!”</p>
<p>After saying that, Wei Jiu laughed strangely, suddenly jumped backward, and left along the cliff.</p>
<p>Su Yishui had been absorbed under the falling water. As the Netherworld Realm had lost the Spirit Spring for too long, once he sank into the vortex, he would automatically detach from the Spirit Spring.</p>
<p>By then, when the Netherworld Realm restored its vitality, it would expel foreign elements and push them out of the Realm.</p>
<p>So he had to leave quickly, to see if he could return to the mortal world first, and then deliver a fatal blow to Su Yishui later. Without the Spirit Spring, Su Yishui should have no strength to fight him.</p>
<p>Ranran did not chase after Wei Jiu. She anxiously waited by the water’s edge for Su Yishui to surface. The water temperature was getting hotter and hotter. If her master didn’t come up soon, he was going to be cooked…</p>
<p>Just as Ranran was becoming impatient and preparing to jump into the water again, large bubbles suddenly emerged from the falling water, with scalding water splashing all around.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">被下降头   UNDER A SPELL</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Ranran quickly swung her stick to scatter the water spray. At the same time, she saw the tall man finally springing out of the water from below.</p>
<p>Ranran was overjoyed and called out loudly, “Shifu…”</p>
<p>But Su Yishui, who had just leaped out of the water, seemed to be in anguish. He grabbed the cliff wall and kept banging his head against it, making sounds of distress. Ranran’s heart sank, thinking that the Spirit Spring was still in her master’s body, and she hurried over to him.</p>
<p>But Su Yishui abruptly lifted his head, his eyes staring blankly. Then, he cast an indifferent glance at her and disappeared like a shadow below the cliff.</p>
<p>At this moment, the Netherworld Realm began to tremble, and rocks continuously fell from the cliff. The Realm began its cycle, re-absorbing the Spirit Spring, entering a phase of self-repair.</p>
<p>The other three people seemed to have vanished, but Ranran didn’t feel that she was about to be expelled from the Netherworld Realm at all.</p>
<p>Her Yin constitution allowed her to remain light and agile in the Netherworld Realm, like a fish in water. But during this expulsion of foreign elements, the Realm couldn’t detect her. In other words, without a person with a Yang constitution to lead her, Ranran would not be able to find the exit and would be permanently trapped in the Netherworld Realm.</p>
<p>Ranran couldn’t understand why her master, who had clearly seen her just now, seemed to not recognize her at all and just left by himself.</p>
<p>At this moment, the collapse of the Netherworld Realm became even more severe. There was no solid ground under Ranran’s feet anymore, so she could only leap quickly between falling rocks while shouting loudly, ” Shifu! Shifu!”</p>
<p>The only response she got was the rumbling of giant rocks and the strange frightening cries from the chasm below.</p>
<p>Ranran knew that when the cliff completely collapsed, she would fall into the abyss, never to return!</p>
<p>In this desperate situation, she could do nothing but futilely jump on the falling stones…</p>
<p>Unfortunately, she still landed on air,  and her whole body starting to plummet rapidly. Ranran closed her eyes, not wanting to see the scene of her body being torn apart by monsters in the endless abyss.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Just then, her wrist was grabbed tightly by someone. Ranran opened her eyes abruptly and saw with delight that her Shifu had returned and had grabbed her wrist in time.</p>
<p>Due to his Yang constitution, he was suspended in mid-air, seemingly drawn upward by some force like a magnet. Ranran was caught by him, at least stopping her fall.</p>
<p>Although Su Yishui had caught her, his gaze was clear but cold. “Who are you? Why do you have the aura of my golden core?”</p>
<p>Ranran was dumbfounded. She couldn’t understand why her Shifu seemed to no longer recognize her.</p>
<p>At this moment, there was no longer a blood-red color in his eyes, and the black lines on his neck had completely disappeared. However, his entire aura was still gloomy and somewhat unfamiliar.</p>
<p>“Shifu… It’s because you gave your golden core to the Tree of Rebirth, that’s how I was reborn! I am your disciple, Xue Ranran!”</p>
<p>Su Yishui furrowed his brows, looking down at the girl whose wrist he was holding. Right now he was in the Netherworld Realm, his memories were jumbled, especially recent ones, fragmented, disjointed and chaotic.</p>
<p>Although he couldn’t remember why he came to the Netherworld Realm, he knew he was about to leave it.</p>
<p>And this tearful little girl with large eyes, for some reason, was being drawn deeper into the abyss.</p>
<p>He didn’t recognize her, but he sensed his core’s aura on her.</p>
<p>Of course, Su Yishui wouldn’t allow his core to be swallowed by the Netherworld Realm, so he grabbed hold of the girl.</p>
<p>Just then, a golden crack appeared in the air, swallowing them in an instant, disappearing into the dazzling golden light.</p>
<p>Ranran was blinded by the light, simultaneously feeling her body being pulled by two forces. She screamed aloud in pain, and could only hold tightly onto the hand that was firmly gripping hers.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When she opened her eyes again, she was still dazzled by the bright light, but it was the glaring sunlight from above, shining on her body, indicating that she had returned to the human realm.</p>
<p>However, the nauseating feeling of being torn apart had not completely disappeared. Ranran closed her eyes and adjusted herself for a moment before opening them again.</p>
<p>When she sat up, she realized she was lying on the wilderness that was previously filled with demonic flowers.</p>
<p>When the Netherworld Realm opened, the demonic flowers and the bodies drained of their essence in the flower sea all turned into powder, and the place had returned to its desolate autumn state……</p>
<p>Ranran felt that the wilderness seemed even more desolate than before, with signs of ice forming on the ground. She felt a bit cold in her autumn clothes, and if she didn’t mobilize her vitality qi, she feared she would freeze in moments.</p>
<p>Looking around, she found no one else on the wasteland except for herself.</p>
<p>Her Shifu, Wei Jiu, and Tu Jiuyuan were nowhere to be seen. Her Uncle Masters and Qin Xuanjiu were also gone.</p>
<p>Just then, she finally heard some sounds of fighting in the distance.</p>
<p>She quickly got up and walked over, only to find Wei Jiu and Su Yishui fighting each other… Well, she might have been a bit inaccurate in her description—it was Wei Jiu being beaten up by her master.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu clearly didn’t get his opportunity to take advantage. His imposing Crimson Gate Sect robe was torn into pieces, his hair disheveled, completely devoid of any dignity.</p>
<p>He had expected Su Yishui to be greatly weakened after separating from the Spirit Spring. Add the confusion caused by the Soul Cleansing talisman he had applied, he should be an easy target if Su Yishui somehow managed to escape from the Netherworld Realm.</p>
<p>So, at the moment Su Yishui pulled Ranran out, Wei Jiu struck out with his whip.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu had visited the Tian Mai Mountain, soaking in the Black Pool to recover some foundational spiritual energy. Although bitten by the Immortal-Devouring Bugs a few times, his recovery had been significant. Plus, during this time, he had ambushed many foundational figures of the Righteous Path, absorbing their spiritual energy. Therefore, his cultivation had subtly improved.</p>
<p>In the Netherworld Realm, hindered by the forcefield, he couldn’t directly confront Su Yishui, who possessed the Spirit Spring. But now that Su Yishui had returned it, Wei Jiu’s true vitality should surpass that of Su Yishui, who had lost half of his Golden Core.</p>
<p>This was why Wei Jiu had the confidence to follow Su Yishui into the Netherworld Realm and why he ambushed him here now.</p>
<p>However, he never expected that Su Yishui, who should have been weak, would be acting like he had divine assistance, attacking fiercely, his vitality surging and formidable.</p>
<p>The man who had just returned from the Netherworld Realm seemed to have just unsealed a long-restrained power, overflowing with an evil aura in every move, deadly and venomous.</p>
<p>Moreover, the spells Su Yishui used were surprisingly similar to his own, absorbing spiritual energy with each move. This time, Su Yishui didn’t even need the Devil Vine; he openly practiced the demonic way of absorbing others’ spiritual energy.</p>
<p>If it were anyone else, they would have been torn apart by Su Yishui long ago. Although Wei Jiu’s skills were not low, far exceeding the heads of the three major sects, he could barely defend himself and kept retreating.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Wei Jiu *had no qualms about looking pathetic, so even with Ranran watching by the side, he didn’t care about his dignity. He summoned a large cloud of black mist with his remaining spiritual energy and escaped with the heavily injured Tu Jiuyuan.<br/>*装孙子 : 装可怜</p>
<p>When only Su Yishui and Ranran were left on the wasteland again, Ranran ran towards him joyfully, only to be ruthlessly pushed back by Su Yishui with a wave of his sleeve.</p>
<p>“Who are you really? Why do you keep calling me Shifu? Could it be that you were sent by Wei Jiu to steal my golden core?”</p>
<p>Ranran listened wide-eyed and tongue-tied to her Shifu’s cold words, at a loss as to how to respond. She could vaguely guess what Wei Jiu’s talisman was now!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Just then, the sound of horse hooves could be heard from a distance.</p>
<p>Ranran turned around to see that it was two uncle masters riding towards them.</p>
<p>When they spotted Su Yishui and Xue Ranran from afar, they wept with joy and shouted loudly for their master, urging their horses to gallop faster.</p>
<p>Yutong had already burst into tears, laughing as she dismounted and hugged Ranran first, then turned to Su Yishui and said “You two have finally returned! We’ve been waiting here for a whole month, coming here every day, and were starting to lose hope!”</p>
<p>A day in heaven is a year on earth, and it seems that the time in the Netherworld Realm is also different from the human realm.</p>
<p>Ranran and the others only felt that they had been in the Netherworld Realm for a few hours , but a whole month had passed in the human realm.</p>
<p>No wonder Ranran felt the weather turning cold; it should be winter by now.</p>
<p>Despite seeing her uncle masters, Ranran’s face showed no joy. Shifu had returned to the mortal realm, but why did she feel like she had……lost him.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The only silver lining was, Su Yishui still remembered the siblings Yuchen and Yutong.</p>
<p>His current memory was somewhat strange. He remembered everything from his past life with Mu Qingge that annoyed him, clear as day, not forgetting anything.</p>
<p>But unexpectedly, he forgot about the later Fan Yao Battle and most of the details of Mu Qingge’s tragic death. Then, it jumped to the memories of the last two years, becoming fragmented and scattered. Every memory related to Mu Qingge and Ranran was completely forgotten.</p>
<p>The Soul-Cleansing Charm cleansed mortal love. Su Yishui has forgotten the stirrings he had in the past and returned to being the obssessive youth who didn’t understand love.</p>
<p>When he heard from Yuchen that Mu Qingge had been dead for twenty years, his face actually showed a hint of anger, “I actually didn’t kill that witch myself?”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran shrank to the side, listening as the uncle masters struggled to repair their master’s memories. What she was thinking about at this moment was the bombshell that Wei Jiu dropped in the Netherworld Realm – she wasn’t the reincarnation of Mu Ranwu but the true reincarnation of Mu Qingge.</p>
<p>Putting aside whether this was true or false, at this moment, their master’s memories no longer contained the sweet moments with Elder Mu. Instead, all that remained was his resentment for being forced into Xishan and the harassment and contempt he suffered.</p>
<p>If she were to say that she might be the true reincarnation of Mu Qingge right now, she would probably be torn to pieces by her master and dipped in sauce.</p>
<p>So, she kept quiet, silently upset on the side.</p>
<p>Shifu, under the talisman’s effect, not only forgot about the past with Elder Mu but also forgot about all the sweet moments with her, Xue Ranran.</p>
<p>On the sea island, the two of them had cuddled while watching the rainbow-colored sea birds and the little dragon playing in the water, scenes that were still vivid in her mind. But now, she was the only one who remembered those beautiful moments…</p>
<p>Although Ranran had been prepared that after the return the Spirit Spring, she and Shifu might have to pretend nothing ever happened, and gradually return back to the normal master and disciple relationship.</p>
<p>However, she did not expect Shifu to be even more decisive than she could ever imagine, actually erasing her existence altogether.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After returning from the wastelands back to town, Su Yishui’s brow remained deeply furrowed. If not for Yuchen and Yutong being his trusted confidants, he really thought these two were spouting nonsense and speaking deceitful words.</p>
<p>What do they mean that he cherished his relationship between master and disciple, and gave up half of his golden core for the chance for Mu Qingge’s reincarnation?</p>
<p>And that there were two fruits on the Rebirth Tree, one of which was premature, and became his beloved disciple, Xue Ranran?</p>
<p>What do they mean in order to extend her life, he kept her in Xishan, teaching and caring for her dearly?</p>
<p>And the most absurd thing was, he went to the Netherworld Realm just to return the Spirit Spring he had stolen with great difficulty?</p>
<p>Su Yishui felt like he had been bewitched before, doing things without rhyme or reason.</p>
<p>Although his memories were temporarily incomplete, Su Yishui didn’t feel anything was amiss with himself, but did he really do all those things? He needed to slowly find out the reasons…</p>
<p>But when he heard that Su Yu actually defeated his father, Prince Ping, and ascended the throne smoothly, Su Yishui couldn’t contain his anger and said coldly, “What was the problem with me before? The rebellion I painstakingly planned ended in failure like this? How did you all assist me? Or did you collude with others and scheme against me?”</p>
<p>Yuchen and Yutong knelt down on the ground, saying helplessly, “Master, this was truly your decision alone. Moreover, Mu Qingge suddenly intervened in worldly affairs, assisting Su Yu, which turned the tide of the battle. Everything was predestined, and human efforts couldn’t change it!”</p>
<p>Su Yishui, upon realizing that his carefully laid plans had been defeated by Mu Qingge, his face darkened, and he slowly squeezed out three words from between his teeth, “Mu Qingge!”</p>
<p>This female demon was truly his nemesis! Why didn’t she die by his hands!</p>
<p>But since she had already been reincarnated, he could slowly settle their debt of hatred with her…</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Su Yishui slowly turned his gaze to the four so-called disciples beside him.</p>
<p>These four, were one more stupid than the other, completely unlikable. Especially that most beautiful young girl, although she had a pleasing appearance, but she was Mu Qingge’s sister, Mu Ranwu…</p>
<p>Recalling how she had once hinted that she could betray her sister for him, and subsequently kept him informed of everything, Su Yishui felt a genuine disgust towards this woman without morals.</p>
<p>This girl named Xue Ranran was born from the Rebirth Tree, no wonder she had his core’s spiritual aura.</p>
<p>As his thoughts wandered, Su Yishui suddenly made a move, intending to capture Ranran and absorb all her spiritual energy, reclaiming the power of his golden core.</p>
<p>His killing intent was strong, and completely undisguised.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The people in the room all shouted in alarm. Yuchen knelt down and tightly held onto his master’s thighs, while Yutong, like a mother hen, shielded Xue Ranran with her arms, “Master, we didn’t deceive you. Ranran is truly your beloved disciple and you dote on her the most. That damned Wei Jiu pasted some kind of talisman on you, sealing your memories. Please, don’t act recklessly, or else I’m truly afraid that you’ll regret it when your memories return!”</p>
<p>Uncle Master Zeng Yi stood nearby, his lips moving several times but hesitating to speak.</p>
<p>For a while, the hall was quite chaotic.</p>
<p>Although the Yu siblings were no match for Su Yishui, however their numerous years of servitude made Su Yishui temporarily suppress his killing intent.</p>
<p>However, he bluntly expressed his dislike for strangers around him, so these four foolish disciples are not allowed to remain too close to him.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When the first snow of early winter fell, Su Yishui heartlessly drove the four abandoned disciples onto the streets, forcing them to find their own shelter.</p>
<p>The four disciples stood under the eaves, exchanging miserable looks with each other.</p>
<p>Bai Baishan glanced at the three fellow disciples and said awkwardly, “I didn’t expect all of us to be kicked out by our master… It’s okay, at least I can explain when I go home. After all, I’m not the only one who’s been abandoned…”</p>
<p>Gao Cang also didn’t expect that after waiting for a month for their master to return, the first thing he did was to disown them. After hearing the sarcastic words from the second senior brother, he cried in frustration, “You’re the one who’s abandoned! We haven’t violated any sect rules, why are we being kicked out?”</p>
<p>Bai Baishan was indignant, “You and Qiu Xier have both been ensnared by the demonic flowers. How is that different from me being bewitched? It’s all evidence of weak willpower! It’s enough to be kicked out!”</p>
<p>This time, Qiu Xier also started crying along with the eldest senior brother.</p>
<p>At this moment, the door behind them cracked open, and they all turned around in joy, thinking that their master couldn’t bear to send them away. However, it was the second uncle master Yu tong, who said apologetically, “Um… your master wants to meditate, and he finds you all too noisy, so it’s better for you to move further away. It’s dark now, and the teahouses and taverns are closed. The inns in town should also be fully booked. If there is really no choice, you can go to the ruined temple to make a fire and shelter from the snow. Wait until the snow stops before finding an inn…”</p>
<p>Now listen here, does this sound like something a beloved master uncle would say?</p>
<p>Ranran, who had remained silent, spoke up, “Let’s go, our Shifu has just returned from the Netherworld Realm and needs to meditate in peace.”</p>
<p>By now, the snow had grown heavier. The four abandoned disciples from Xishan walked forward with difficulty, and Qiu Xier wiped her tears, saying, “Ranran, do we really have to spend the night in the ruined temple?”</p>
<p>“Why would you need to go to the ruined temple? All of you come with me.” A voice came from behind them.</p>
<p>They turned to see that it was the Fourteenth  Uncle Master, Zeng Yi, who had come after them.</p>
<p>“I still have a Medicine shop in Wuma Town. Come with me and stay there temporarily,” he said.</p>
<p>Hearing their uncle master’s words, the four obediently followed him to the medicine shop in the east of town.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Although it was smaller than the Horse Trading Post, at least they have a place to stay. After Zeng Yi instructed his workers to prepare bedding and settled the children, he saw Ranran looking dejected and took the opportunity to comfort her when they were alone, “You know that your master has been enchanted by an evil charm, so don’t blame him. If he doesn’t get better soon, I’ll send you back to reunite with your parents. Didn’t you tell me before that you wanted to graduate quickly and go back to serve your parents?”</p>
<p>Ranran silently poured a cup of tea for her uncle master and suddenly asked, “In the Netherworld Realm, Wei Jiu said I’m actually Mu Qingge. Uncle Master, do you know the truth of this?”</p>
<p>After saying this, she looked directly at Zeng Yi, and Zeng Yi’s expression froze like he had been coated with glue.</p>
<p>After a while, his eyes reddened, he slowly set the teacup down, and then fell to his knees before Ranran with a thud, “Master, the disciple has been unfilial. For not acknowledging you, please punish me!”</p>
<p>Ranran’s question was merely a probe. Perhaps Wei Jiu was talking nonsense. She couldn’t possibly take that demon’s words seriously, could she?</p>
<p>She never expected that Uncle Master would react so strongly after hearing this question, kneeling so earnestly in front of her.</p>
<p>Ranran was startled and quickly knelt down to help him up, “Fourteenth Uncle Master, what are you doing? Aren’t you going to *overwhelm me?”<br/>*折杀 is 对方的过分的礼节或过重的馈赠使自己无法承受<em> when given too much undue respect</em></p>
<p>But Zeng Yi just refused to get up, tears streaming down his face, “Master, what Wei Jiu said is all true. You are the true Mu Qingge of Xishan, our master. As for that one, she’s just an imposter. I know about this, and Su Yishui knows too. It’s just that he was afraid you will have to take up the responsibilities from your past life, so he didn’t want to tell you. I also thought that letting you live peacefully and blissfully in this life is better than anything else. We took such liberties, so please punish us, master!”</p>
<p>No matter how much Ranran tried to persuade him, he wouldn’t budge. She could only sigh and sit back down, looking at Zeng Yi kneeling on the ground, her head buzzing.</p>
<p>This trip to the Netherworld Realm had turned everything upside down, causing confusion between master and disciples. Her mind was also in chaos right then, and she needed to calm down and sort things out slowly.</p>
<p>After Zeng Yi tearfully finished acknowledging his master, he still felt uneasy, so he cautioned with concern, “Master, your current spiritual power is still not comparable to Su Yishui’s. He has forgotten the past, like he was a newly entered disciple, just a reckless kid. You must never, ever reveal your identity in front of him. Otherwise, he might do an about-face and turn hostile!”</p>
<p>Ranran blinked and asked, “So the current Elder Mu…… is actually Mu Ranwu?”</p>
<p>Zeng Yi nodded and sighed, “Master, please… don’t be soft-hearted like you were before…”</p>
<p>Ranran smiled wryly, “Uncle Master, please don’t call me that anymore. I’m just an eighteen-year-old girl now. How could I be your master, if the others overhear, they will find it very weird…”</p>
<p>Zeng Yi nodded repeatedly and kept saying yes.</p>
<p>In fact, in his opinion, Su Yishui forgetting his mentor Mu Qingge was actually a good thing. The relationship between them was like an ill-fated entanglement. If they could live well separately, it would be considered fortunate.</p>
<p>Now that Su Yishui was disowning everyone, acting coldly towards him and treating Ranran like a stranger, if Su Yishui kept thinking about absorbing Ranran’s cultivation to supplement his golden core, it would be disastrous.</p>
<p>Now that the matter of the Spirit Spring was over, there wasn’t much use to be staying here. He decided to leave with his master as soon as possible and stay away from the disputes from her past life……</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Zeng Yi made his plans, so the next day before dawn, he had the servants pack their bags and prepare to leave.</p>
<p>But before they could finish packing, Yutong came looking for them again, saying that Su Yishui wanted Zeng Yi to go over and inquire about the businesses entrusted to him.</p>
<p>Most of the properties under Zeng Yi’s name were actually entrusted to him by Su Yishui before he secluded himself in Western Mountain. He was just a steward.</p>
<p>Now Su Yishui suddenly summoned him, obviously wanting to take back his businesses.</p>
<p>Zeng Yi feels that it doesn’t matter. Anyway, his savings over the years were enough to support his master and ensure that she would be well taken care of. If he didn’t have to deal with those businesses, he would be even more relaxed.</p>
<p>But when he returned to the Horse Trading Post, he saw the handsome and cold man sitting in front of his table, frowning at the table full of trinkets.</p>
<p>There were grasshoppers woven from grass on the table, a paper lantern that was just half finished, and two small bamboo baskets containing month-old dried sweet potatoes and other snacks that had hardened a bit.</p>
<p>Su Yishui instinctively felt that these were not things he had placed there, but the Yu siblings were sure that these were indeed all put personally by him. Including the notes on how to make lanterns, they were indeed in his own handwriting.</p>
<p>This really annoyed him. Su Yi Shui suspected that he had been bewitched in the past, otherwise why would he do such idle and boring things?</p>
<p>As Zeng Yi walked in, Su Yishui waved his long arm and swept all the things on the table into the dustpan on the side.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>
<p>Oh no! Its the amnesia arc! </p>

<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Zeng Yi looked at the little trinkets swept into the dustpan and did not comment.</p>
<p>However, to Zeng Yi’s surprise, Su Yishui didn’t intend to take back his businesses but rather asked him to withdraw funds for setting up a new place for cultivation.</p>
<p>Su Yishui absolutely hated West Mountain. Since the palace coup had failed and his cultivation had been damaged, affecting his ascension with the Nascent Soul stage, it was a priority to find a new secluded place for cultivation.</p>
<p>Zeng Yi nodded and then had his account books brought over, placing them on Su Yishui’s desk, tactfully expressing his intention to leave.</p>
<p>Su Yishui listened expressionlessly and then said flatly, “Although I’ve forgotten some memories, I never doubt my judgment in people. Since I entrusted you with such a large estate before, and you managed it well, why would I retract now? I heard from Yu Tong that when you were in distress, I was the one who saved you. If you want to repay that favor, you should continue doing what you’re supposed to do, right?”</p>
<p>His tone now carried a hint of threat and coercion, devoid of the calm and tolerance he had nurtured over twenty years.</p>
<p>Zeng Yi sighed, treating the present Su Yishui as the bad-tempered youth from twenty years ago. Rather than arguing over words, he simply explained, “I’ve managed this for twenty years and I’m tired. I want to find a secluded place with no one around to live. The accountants below are all experienced hands, with their own rules and protocols. Even if I leave, you will be able to manage.”</p>
<p>Seeing that Zeng Yi had made up his mind, Su Yishui didn’t insist with empty polite words and just lowered his gaze, dismissing him.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Zeng Yi returned to the medicine shop and briefly explained the situation to Ranran, urging her to leave with him quickly. When they went back, they could pick up Ranran’s parents, then proceed to temporarily avoid worldly matters for some time.</p>
<p>Ranran listened, and understood that this was the best arrangement right now.</p>
<p>If she was truly Mu Qingge, her current situation was indeed dangerous. Su Yishui, who had completely forgotten the good points of Mu Qingge, was himself the biggest threat.</p>
<p>Although Ranran didn’t remember her past life after her rebirth, she had gathered enough information in these two years to piece things together.</p>
<p>Plus, Mu Ruanwu had deliberately schemed to take her place, so naturally she would not intend to get along with her.</p>
<p>But thinking about leaving Su Yishui, perhaps never meeting again in this life, Ranran felt an indescribable dull pain in her heart.</p>
<p>However, she was very certain about one thing: the affection Shifu had shown her all these while was probably meant for Mu Qingge. Regardless of whether he later loved or hated Mu Qingge, it had nothing to do with Xue Ranran.</p>
<p>Even though Wei Jiu and Uncle Master Zeng Yi both say she is Mu Qingge, she doesn’t remember at all and she didn’t feel that she should inherit anything from this identity as Mu Qingge.</p>
<p>Since Shifu had forgotten, then they no longer owed anything to each other. Perhaps this was fortunate for both of them.</p>
<p>She innately won’t indulge in sadness for too long, so when she felt out of sorts, she would automatically find something to do, like packing her bags and then using the small kitchen in the medicine shop to cook meat and vegetables, making the last meal to send over to Shifu.</p>
<p>According to Wei Jiu’s insinuations, her death in her past life was indeed closely related to Su Yishui. But Ranran tried not to think too much about past grievances.</p>
<p>In this life, Shifu had always been very good to her, so cooking a meal for him before bidding farewell to end their master-disciple relationship was only right.</p>
<p>But she didn’t dare to overtly show this last bit of filial piety. She handed the exquisite tray of food to second uncle master, letting her deliver it to the master.</p>
<p>Yu Tong watched Ranran, who was carrying a small travel bag, and couldn’t help but feel sad. She softly comforted her, “Your master has just forgotten temporarily, he will remember eventually. Gao Cang and the others haven’t left. Why are you leaving so hastily?”</p>
<p>Ranran knew that second uncle master didn’t know she was the real Mu Qingge. Otherwise, based on Yu tong’s prejudice against Mu Qingge, she wouldn’t have been so kind to her.</p>
<p>She sighed softly, smiled, and said, “I haven’t seen my parents for a long time and miss them very much. It’s better to part ways here and go back to be with my parents. This braised pork belly is Shifu’s favorite. I cooked it in a clay pot and it’s still steaming hot now. If it cools down, it will affect the taste. Pls hurry and take it to him.”</p>
<p>Yu Tong nodded, quickly took the tray and entered the dining room. But when she came out again to the door, there were only snowflakes swirling in the northern wind, and the girl who loved to smile had disappeared without a trace.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Although the Soul-Cleansing Talisman was quite overbearing, Su Yishui didn’t feel much discomfort.</p>
<p>Losing memories was indeed troublesome, but after filling in the gaps from Yu’s siblings, he suddenly felt that forgetting was also a good thing.</p>
<p>The past twenty years sounded mundane and boring. Most of the time, he was confined in seclusion in the cave on West Mountain, like he was punishing himself.</p>
<p>Leaving aside other matters, voluntarily giving up his golden core was indeed stupid and deserved punishment!</p>
<p>And the matter of taking disciples in the past two years might have stemmed from being too bored in seclusion on West Mountain, causing him to be like Mu Qingge and take in some useless disciples.</p>
<p>Those few *ugly disciples with the exception of Xue Ranran, were all quite mediocre. If he were to take in disciples, he would never have accepted such trash to waste his time.<br/>*歪瓜裂枣 <em>literally poorly formed melons and dates</em></p>
<p>As for Xue Ranran, it was only natural for her to have innate talent. After all, she inherited half of his golden core and essentially took a shortcut in cultivation. Although Yu’s siblings were very proud that he had always been like a good master and took care of his disciples with dedication, the current Su Yishui couldn’t feel any sense of accomplishment as a teacher. He only thought about how to retrieve his core.</p>
<p>Moreover… he remembered that he had already begun preparations to fast for cultivation. Usually, he ate once a day or once every three days. After all, consuming too much grain and rice was not conducive to purifying the spirit channels.</p>
<p>But what’s going on with his body now that he gets hungry every mealtime? Did he spend twenty years of seclusion on West Mountain for nothing?</p>
<p>However, Yu Tong’s culinary skills had greatly improved. The braised pork belly was savory and not greasy, perfect with rice. The stir-fried shrimp with beets was also delicious.</p>
<p>Su Yishui momentarily forgot about his big fasting plans and finished all the dishes.</p>
<p>This actually made him look forward to the next meal, thinking that he could just start fasting after a few more meals, it wouldn’t delay his cultivation too much.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But when the next meal was served, it took all his appetite away. The ingredients were somewhat old, and coupled with rough cooking, it tasted terrible. For example, the dish of stir-fried meat was overcooked and tough.</p>
<p>After taking two bites, Su Yishui immediately set down his chopsticks. He usually didn’t bother scolding people over such trivial matters, it was excusable that perhaps Yu Tong had just made a careless slip. However, after three days, Su Yishui couldn’t bear it any longer and called Yu Tong over to ask, “Why have the meals you’ve been making in the past few days been getting worse?”</p>
<p>Yu Tong looked ashamed and replied, “Master, these meals were all made by the kitchen maids from the Horse Trading post. If I made them, they would probably taste even worse…”</p>
<p>Su Yishui lifted his head to glance at her and asked, “Who made the braised pork the other day?”</p>
<p>Yu Tong honestly replied, “Of course that would be Ranran. You like her cooking the most. If it’s not her cooking, you never want to take an extra bite.</p>
<p>Su Yishui frowned and paused for a moment before saying, “Then……bring her back to cook.”</p>
<p>Yu Tong wore a troubled expression and said, “But…..that child has already left with her fourteen uncle master. I heard they went back to visit her parents.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Su Yishui said flatly, “You may go. You don’t need to bring me any meals today.”</p>
<p>So it was Xue Ranran who made it! The former Mu Ranwu had become quite the gourmet in this life, just like Mu Qingge in making food and drinks.</p>
<p>Now that he thought about it, the taste of those dishes indeed had a hint of her sister’s style…</p>
<p>Both of them are just bad influences, promoting indulgence in worldly pleasures! If he had known earlier, he wouldn’t even have touched it. It’s good that she has left, he can now start afresh on the right path of cultivation, to proceed with fasting and purifying the spirit channels…</p>
<p>However, after a day had passed, he found that daytime was still bearable, but in the late night hours, Su Yishui always heard his stomach rumbling. His mind uncontrollably went back to the day, to the taste when he ate pieces of pork belly together with vegetables and rice in every mouthful…</p>
<p>When he realized he was chewing unconsciously, Su Yishui opened his eyes in exasperation: Damn it! Was he losing control? Why was he so hungry?</p>
<p>It wasn’t just hunger; there was also an indescribable emptiness in his heart, as if he had lost something important but couldn’t remember what it was.</p>
<p>This day, Su Yishui decided not to meditate. He laid on the bed which he has not been on for a while, to quieten his mind. When he turned over, he discovered a small snack bag under his pillow, embroidered with tacky apricot flowers and colorful butterflies, clearly a girl’s item. Below the bag, there was also the embroidered character “Ran,” like a round bud.</p>
<p>Opening the bag, there were preserved plums and jerky inside. Su Yishui took a dried plum and put it in his mouth. Because it had been stored for a while, it wasn’t as good as it had been a month ago. But when Su Yishui held the dried plum in his mouth, he could taste a unique sweetness, miraculously calming his restless pangs of hunger…</p>
<p>Su Yishui slowly closed his eyes and chewed. He then slowly opened his eyes, and glared at the delicate little bag in his hand with a murderous intent.</p>
<p>Now he was absolutely certain, that Xue Ranran must not stay! She was like her sister, a demonic hindrance to his ascension, a witch that shouldn’t exist in the world!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>That demonic hindrance to an immortal’s ascension, had left quietly with uncle master Zeng Yi.</p>
<p>Zeng Yi didn’t bring any entourage, just traveling light with Ranran. Although he didn’t know light body technique, Ranran said there was no need to hurry anyhow.</p>
<p>So the two of them took the relay station’s carriage, and made several detours They first went to West Mountain, dug up the small tree in Ranran’s yard, then Ranran packed four large boxes of books from the Xishan study.</p>
<p>Setting off again, they finally arrived at the villa where the Xue couple were living.</p>
<p>When Qiao Lian heard that her daughter had graduated and didn’t need to go back to West Mountain anymore, she was thrilled.</p>
<p>Her daughter was already eighteen; they really couldn’t delay anymore. Coming back now was perfect for them to look at potential suitors.</p>
<p>But Ranran said she had no intention of marrying now, and she needed to avoid her enemies for a while, so she needed to seclude herself in the mountains for a period of time.</p>
<p>The Xue couple knew that their daughter’s background might be special. They had been hiding in the villa for too long, and were always on edge. If they could live in seclusion in another place with their daughter, it wouldn’t be bad either.</p>
<p>Being together as a family, was always a good thing.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Zeng Yi had an elegant villa at Lian Mountain. It was not part of Su Yishui’s estate, but one he built for his own retirement. The surrounding villages were also few, with beautiful scenery and pleasant climate.</p>
<p>So the four of them, along with the two servants who had served Zeng Yi for many years, went to Lian Mountain together.</p>
<p>After Ranran replanted the small tree in front of her room, she touched the delicate leaves on the tree, recalling  the time when Su Yishui planted this tree with her.</p>
<p>At that time, she felt that her Shifu was really good to her. But now looking back, perhaps Su Yishui had more of feelings of guilt towards her?</p>
<p>That beautiful and sweet memory had been wiped clean from Shifu’s mind. From now on, he no longer needed to worry or go about doing things for her.</p>
<p>The Spirit Spring has been returned to its rightful place, balancing the human realm and the netherworld. From now on, she just had to live her own life as Xue Ranran…</p>
<p>Ranran was very broad-minded in her thinking, but when she felt her face itching and reached out to touch it, she realized tears were streaming down her face.</p>
<p>It would seem that some things were easy to pick up, but when it came time to let go, it would take some effort…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Fortunately, there were still plenty of matters for her to worry about. The white tiger and vermilion bird had followed her all the way to Lian Mountain. Little white tiger was still alright, sleeping and eating all day like a cat, or running off into the woods to catch rabbits and birds.</p>
<p>But the vermilion bird had been very restless these past few days, always perching on Ranran’s shoulder, pecking at her earlobes, urging her to hum and sing with it. Not even delicious peanuts could calm it down.</p>
<p>Moreover, its size seemed a bit uncontrollable. There were a few nights when it grew larger again and soared into the sky.</p>
<p>Although this place was rarely visited by people, such phenomena would eventually attract some unscrupulous individuals. So Ranran used her skills to set up a spiritual shield around Lian Mountain. Although the shield was not as powerful as her Shifu’s powers, it was better than nothing.</p>
<p>When Ranran left the West Mountain, she not only took away the small tree but also unceremoniously took several large boxes of books as well.</p>
<p>Since she was Mu Qingge, those books in the study belonged to her. Ranran loved reading, so she left a note for her Shifu, with polite pleasantries, expressing that she had taken the books, and if he needed them in the future, she would return them.</p>
<p>The truth was Ranran had no intention of returning them; it was just for show. If Wei Jiu’s words were true, and Su Yishui had caused her death as Mu Qingge, how could he have the nerve to ask for the books that belonged to her?</p>
<p>So, with Zhu que acting strangely, Ranran searched through the books and finally found the reason. Zhu Que… had entered a stage of longing for springtime romance.</p>
<p>In other words, it wanted to find a mate and lay some eggs.</p>
<p>Ranran was a good owner, but she didn’t know where to find a partner for it. So she simply explained Zhu Que’s current condition to it and instructed it to fly safely towards the southwest, to the southern land of the heavens, which was the native land of the vermilion birds. If everything goes well, it should find a suitable mate there.</p>
<p>After giving the instructions, Ranran opened the spiritual shield around Lian Mountain and let the little Zhu Que out.</p>
<p>But the little Zhu Que was reluctant to leave, circling around Ranran’s head several times. In the end, Ranran had to comfort it, telling it to bring its children to look for her in the future. Only then did it give a long screech and fly straight into the sky, circling and whistling in the clouds.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Just as Ranran was waving goodbye reluctantly to Zhu Que, like sending a child off on a long journey, someone behind her said coldly, “Do you not know the value of a vermilion bird, and just let it go so easily?”</p>
<p>Ranran spun around and saw the handsome man she hadn’t seen for a long time standing behind her, his eyes cold as frost.</p>
<p>“Shi…” Ranran was momentarily stunned, instinctively wanting to call him “Shifu.” But then she remembered that he had already expelled her from the sect, so she stopped herself in time and asked hesitatingly, “Why…are you here?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui noticed the girl’s alienation, very different from when she had come out of the netherworld, almost hugging him and crying in distress.</p>
<p>Thinking of how Yu Tong had vigorously tried to prove to him how attached this Xue Ranran was to him, was simply a joke!</p>
<p>Seeing Su Yi Shui looking at her coldly, Ranran took a deep breath silently, telling herself not to dwell on the past too much. Shifu did not remember their intimacy when the Spirit Spring possessed him, so there was no need for any embarrassment.</p>
<p>She cleared her throat and said in a small voice, “Zhu Que didn’t establish a soul contract with me, so of course it’s free to come and go.”</p>
<p>Su Yishui cast her a glance, somewhat surprised that this Mu Ranwu was not as greedy as she had been in her previous life. The legendary Zhu Que, unattainable to ordinary people, she just casually let it go!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Su Yishui hadn’t forgotten his purpose in coming. He coldly said, “You took my golden core, and then went back to loot West Mountain. Do you think no one will hold you accountable?”</p>
<p>Ranran felt a little upset and whispered, “How can you take back something that’s already given away? It’s not like I forced you to sacrifice your golden core… You once said that the books in the study, I could take them as I pleased.”</p>
<p>Seeing his forsaken disciple so disobedient, Su Yishui snorted coldly, once again confirming that he had indeed been blind and made a mistake in taking her as his disciple.</p>
<p>Ranran knew, that if he really asked for his golden core back, she might lose most of her spiritual power, and her life might be at risk.</p>
<p>But even if she knew he had come to take her life, there was still an indescribable feeling in her heart now that she could see him once more.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But casting life and death aside, it was almost noon now. Ribs were still simmering on her stove. A pot of three salt-baked chicken was almost ready too. Complement these with some greens, even if she was going to die, she wanted to die with a full stomach.</p>
<p>So she simply ignored Su Yishui’s blatant threat and casually asked him, “…are you hungry? I made salt-baked chicken, it’s very delicious when eaten hot.”</p>
<p>It was just a casual question, and she didn’t expect him to accept. But to her great surprise, her former Shifu, handsome like an immortal, walked with composure towards the villa in the mountains with a cold look, his steps… somewhat hurried.</p>
<p>Uncle master Zeng Yi had gone down the mountain with his father for some business and wouldn’t be back for two days. These three salt-baked chickens were originally meant for her and her mother to eat over three days.</p>
<p>But with an uninvited guest, one pot of chicken was barely enough.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Su Yishui had come this time to settle scores with his wayward disciple. But since it was noon now, and she had extended an invitation, it wouldn’t hurt to have a meal.</p>
<p>At the dining table, Qiao Lian naturally took care of the guest warmly. Upholding the rural woman’s habit of not eating at the table when guests were present, she left her daughter to host her master.</p>
<p>So Ranran didn’t eat a single bite, just silently watched her former master devour the three chickens like he was possessed by a *weasel, leaving behind clean white bones.<br/><em>黄鼠狼 has a related idiom 黄鼠狼给鸡拜年——没安好心 </em><br/><em>but ironically it seems the weasel is not all that fond of chicken lol</em></p>
<p>“…Shifu, how long have you been hungry” Ranran couldn’t change her habit in a short time. In a moment of carelessness, she called him “Shifu” again.</p>
<p>Su Yishui was satiated. When he put down his chopsticks, he realized he had forgotten himself while he ate.</p>
<p>But he always handled things calmly, so he completely ignored Ranran’s question and cut straight to, “You have my golden core. I won’t allow you to leave as you like. Pack up your things later, go back with me.”</p>
<p>Ranran fell silent for a moment and said in a small voice, “I won’t go back. If you insist on taking back your cultivation, then feel free to do so. You were once my Shifu and also saved my life, so you are entitled to whatever you want.”</p>
<p>She never liked owing people. Although taking back something that was given was childish behavior, she could forgive her Shifu since he’s a victim to the soul-cleansing talisman.</p>
<p>Now that her Shifu gets annoyed just by looking at her, if it was just because of the core, then he could take it back. Ranran felt that with her current spiritual power, even though she could be affected, it wouldn’t necessarily lead to her soul scattering. At worst, she would be weaker.</p>
<p>Su Yishui hadn’t expected this girl to be so stubborn; he narrowed his eyes for a moment, his face darkening. In his opinion, this was indeed the simplest way.</p>
<p>But the delicious taste of the salt-baked chicken still lingered in his mouth, and the thought that if she died, he may perhaps never taste such delicacies again, made him feel regretful…</p>
<p>The two sat at the table in silence, the frozen atmosphere making things quite awkward.</p>
<p>At that moment, Qiao Lian came over with washed pears and placed them on the table. Seeing their expressions, she tugged at her daughter’s sleeve and said, “Don’t anger your master. Although you’ve returned after completing your studies, a day as a mentor is a lifetime as a father. You should still be respectful and filial to Master Su in the future!”</p>
<p>Ranran thought to herself, <em>in my past life, I was his master! I don’t see him showing respect? </em>Now that he’s just forgotten a part of his memories, why did he turn into a ferocious devil?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After Qiao Lian left, Su Yishui suddenly stood up and said coldly, “When did I say you finished your training? Disobeying your master’s orders and leaving the sect without permission is tantamount to betraying the sect! According to the sect rules, your spiritual roots should be severed, your cultivation destroyed, and you should be tied with a rock and sunken to the depths of the Western Mountain!”</p>
<p>Ranran was eating a pear and almost choked upon hearing this. She quickly swallowed and said, “When did we have such sect rules? How come I didn’t know?”</p>
<p>Xishan was a laid-back sect, and the rules of Mu Qingge’s sect had been lackadaisical. Later, Su Yishui’s rules were not much better. Disobedient disciples were simply stripped of their cultivation and sent away from the mountain.</p>
<p>Such inhumane rules such as “tied with a rock and sunken to the depths of the Western Mountain”, she had never ever heard of them!</p>
<p>However, Su Yishui was very composed, as he lowered his eyes and said, “Am I the sect master of Xishan, or are you? If I say there is then there is!”</p>
<p>Hmm… even though Ranran really wanted to say that being a sect master wasn’t a big deal, she seemed to have done it before as well, but since Su Yishui was using sect rules to oppress her, she couldn’t say much more and could only follow him back for now.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, Su Yishui was able to find her here because of the aura of his golden core.</p>
<p>After he found out that his core had been divided and given to Mu Qingge, he had stood in the crowd and tried to detect it when Mu Qingge was parading about with her disciples. But he found that the core aura on Mu Qingge was not strong, as if half of his core that was in the tree had all gone to the fruit that became Xue Ranran.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>
<p>It’s a little sad that right before they went to the Netherworld Realm, Su Yishui had been making another lantern for Ranran even after he said he wanted her to make one for him.<br/>And she in turn, had left him some bedtime snacks under his pillow as a surprise.<br/>URRRRGH</p>
<p>Still the new arc’s bad boy Su Yishui is also really fun.<br/>The classic trope where the way into Su Yishui’s heart is through his stomach still stands LOL</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">故意置气   TANTRUMS</h3>
<p><em>ALT SUGGESTED TITLE :</em> DATING THE REAL SU YISHUI</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu was promoted due to his outstanding performance in the confrontation with Gao Kan. Mu Qingge, on the other hand, leaned on this big tree for shade and has now established her own sect, once again establishing her own school.</p>
<p>Even Yu Tong and the others were surprised. In just over a month, Mu Qingge’s followers had become quite numerous, including many cultivators who have already attained their cores…</p>
<p>Even in her past life, Mu Qingge didn’t have so many powerful disciples!</p>
<p>It seemed like some force was supporting her from behind the scenes…</p>
<p>Su Yishui should have looked for Mu Qingge to settle old scores, but seeing her acting like the founder of a sect parading around, he became extremely anxious.</p>
<p>Moreover, for some reason, ever since he returned from the Netherworld Realm, he always felt an inexplicable emptiness and a sense of desolation in his heart, making him unmotivated in showing off his strength.</p>
<p>This feeling of emptiness and desolation always struck him unexpectedly, and he didn’t know how to reduce it. Although it didn’t affect his daily life, it made him inexplicably annoyed.</p>
<p>Food that was hard to swallow, a tongue that had become unusually sensitive, along with lines and lines of beautiful handwriting and mischievous notes and annotations in the books he carried with him, all subtly revealed how someone had once boldly changed his lifestyle habits.</p>
<p>Su Yishui felt increasingly angry towards that girl named Xue Ranran, and this burning anger was set ablaze when he arrived back at West Mountain.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>According to Yu Tong, the Rebirth Tree that was planted in Xue Ranran’s yard had been dug up by its roots and taken away. Su Yishui had wanted to find a way to remove the effects of the soul-cleansing talisman, but he found that his study had been completely ransacked by a little thief.</p>
<p>The little thief even left a note, claiming to have borrowed them.</p>
<p>The words on the note, turned out to be exactly the same as the annotations in his books. Now Su Yishui finally believed what Yu Tong had said — he had once pampered this disciple a lot!</p>
<p>But no matter how much he pampered her, there should be boundaries, right? He never agreed, so how could taking away so many books without permission be borrowing? This was clearly theft!</p>
<p>As a result, Su Yishui suddenly felt very depressed. Every time he entered the empty study, he felt an inexplicable anger rising within him.</p>
<p>To counter Mu Qingge, he had also been recruiting disciples recently.</p>
<p>It was said that Xue Ranran had lived up to expectations and had made a name for Xishan Sect at the Tian Mai Mountain Marrow-Cleansing Pool meet. With this, the idea of establishing a new sect could be put off for a while. After all, West Mountain was spacious enough to accommodate more disciples. If he had to relocate and rebuild, who knew how long that would take.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>A month passed this way, and Su Yishui just felt extremely hungry lately. Sometimes during meditation, he would be distracted. When he was in the empty study, he pulled out a book placed on the desk, and an old discolored menu fell out of the pages.</p>
<p>Looking at the handwriting, it should be written by Xue Ranran. There were even illustrations next to each dish name, such as Salt and Pepper Duck, Soup-filled Shrimp Dumplings, Dongpo Pork, all in all more than twenty dishes.</p>
<p>Beneath the dishes, there was a sweet little line: “Shifu, write down what you want to eat every day and leave it on the desk. I’ll make it for you at noon…”</p>
<p>Although Su Yishui didn’t remember, he could imagine himself flipping the dishes plaques like an emperor in West Mountain.</p>
<p>That little girl probably planned the ingredients for lunch while tidying up his study every day. After his morning meditation, he could enjoy delicious meals at noon.</p>
<p>But now, the menu was still here, yet the person who cooked the dishes had forgotten their gratitude and loyalty, and left the sect!</p>
<p>The gates of Xishan were too unsecured!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Later, Su Yishui didn’t know what he was thinking. He just went out aimlessly by moonlight, followed the aura of the golden core and found Ranran like that.</p>
<p>Although he came without a purpose, perhaps just to retrieve his books and reclaim his core at the same time.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, when he arrived, he saw the silly girl letting go of the precious Vermilion Bird.</p>
<p>Although he really wanted to break that Vermilion Bird’s neck to obtain its spiritual blood, he inexplicably just stood by and watched with disinterest as Xue Ranran nagged incessantly to the Vermilion Bird, even bidding it farewell reluctantly.</p>
<p><em>This Xue Ranran wasn’t as shrewd as Mu Ranwu had been in her past life!</em></p>
<p>Su Yishui squinted as he drew this conclusion. When he looked at this girl again, somehow, his disgust towards her seemed to lessen a little.</p>
<p>After eating the salt-baked Chicken, Su Yishui felt that even though half of the golden core was precious, it didn’t matter to share it with this silly little girl for the time being.</p>
<p>At least her cooking was very delicious. Before ascending, having a good meal now and then, would be a comfort in the boring life of cultivation.</p>
<p>Since he had taken her as a disciple, there should have been some intent behind it, only he had carelessly forgotten it. With the power of his golden core in her possession, it was naturally safest for her to stay by his side.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if she fell into the hands of someone like Wei Jiu, wouldn’t he unduly benefit from his core?</p>
<p>Considering it like this, retrieving the disciple who had left the sect without authorization became par for the course.</p>
<p>Under the strict and ruthless rules of the sect, Ranran’s brief escape was declared over within a month.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Su Yishui seemed to be in a big hurry. Instead of waiting for Zeng Yi to return, he just had Ranran tell Qiaolian that her cultivation was insufficient and she had to return to West Mountain to cultivate. Then he was going to bring Ranran down the mountain immediately and go back.</p>
<p>Qiaolian, upon hearing this, became anxious as well. She spoke frankly to Su Yishui, “Master Su, our Ranran is not young anymore, and her cultivation is almost there. Her father and I were thinking of arranging a marriage for her soon. How much more does she need to cultivate? How about…we stop here?”</p>
<p>Ranran was afraid that Su Yishui would get angry at her mother, so she quickly intervened, saying that stopping her cultivation now wouldn’t be good for her health.</p>
<p>After hearing this, Qiaolian, fearing for her daughter’s life, quickly packed Ranran’s things and let her leave with the master.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>However, on the way back, Su Yishui once again angrily discovered, that this young girl seemed to have no respect for him as her master.</p>
<p>If they were going on the wind, it shouldn’t take long to travel, but she was dragging her feet.</p>
<p>“Shifu, you see there’s a town ahead. When uncle master Zeng Yi and I came over, we ate at a Scallion Pancake stall in the town. They also served a pig stomach soup with the pancakes, which was really delicious. How about having lunch there?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui coldly glanced at her, intending to refuse flatly. But seeing her pitifully looking at him with her big dewy eyes, what came out of his mouth was, “… Street food, will it be unsanitary?”</p>
<p>Ranran quickly said, “The stall owners are very clean. I saw that they used fresh ingredients, and the pig stomach they used was very fresh too. The soup just out of the pot, with a spoonful of hot oil and fried chili peppers, is really fresh and spicy.”</p>
<p>Perhaps it was this greedy girl’s longing expression that moved him, Su Yishui unexpectedly said again, “Alright…”</p>
<p>However, when he sat in the cramped and crowded stall, his handsome face gave a dirty look like the unwashed pig intestines. He silently wondered why he was squeezing with a bunch of mediocre people to drink pig offal soup?</p>
<p>And the young girl sitting next to him, was wearing a pink floral jacket… so unbearably common!</p>
<p>“Shifu, see if the taste I prepared is alright?”</p>
<p>Ranran seemed not to notice Su Yishui’s dark expression, handing him the soup with added chili. Then she eagerly picked up a scallion pancake and started to eat.</p>
<p>Their scallion pancakes had crispy lard in them, making them incredibly fragrant.</p>
<p>Seeing the girl eating happily, Su Yishui hesitantly brought the pancake to his mouth and took a bite… Well, it was indeed soft, fragrant, and had a unique taste…</p>
<p>But he just couldn’t get used to eating with a crowd, so he only took one bite and put down his chopsticks.</p>
<p>When Ranran asked why he wasn’t eating, Su Yishui coldly said, “Buy more food later. Don’t take me to crowded stalls like this again. Since you’ve been my disciple for so long, didn’t you know that I don’t like being too close to strangers?”</p>
<p>… Ranran really didn’t know Su Yishui had this problem. Back in the capital city, he had patiently accompanied her, going to various stalls to taste food one by one.</p>
<p>The shops in the capital were even more noisy and crowded than these small-town stalls, and some even required queuing for an hour to get in!</p>
<p>But Su Yishui would accompany her patiently, never showing the annoyance he was showing now!</p>
<p>“Also, as a disciple of Xishan, dress more plainly. Don’t wear clothes like the ones you have on now in the future!”</p>
<p>Ranran pursed her lips and looked at her jacket… Well, she was indeed wearing a brightly colored coat made by her mother. The color is a little glaring.</p>
<p>It seemed that Shifu’s aesthetic sense hadn’t changed at all, only liking plain colors. But his disdain was completely undisguised now, completely devoid of the patience he had when picking out new clothes for her.</p>
<p>Perhaps he was also very annoyed back then but managed to hide it well. In order to compensate for his guilt towards Mu Qingge, he added a bit of patience?</p>
<p>Suddenly, Ranran’s heart was filled with mixed emotions, and even the delicious soup became difficult to swallow. She didn’t know if the soul-cleansing talisman’s effect would be lifted.</p>
<p>But Shifu had forgotten everything that happened after Mu Qingge’s death, and also forgot about their past together. He seemed to have changed completely.</p>
<p>This made Ranran realize once again, that all his affection for her might have been due to his guilt towards Mu Qingge.</p>
<p>If that’s really the case, Su Yishui might as well not regain his memories. Because she doesn’t need this kind of affection driven by guilt and compensation.</p>
<p>After all, she is now Xue Ranran, having forgotten everything as Mu Qingge. If she were to mindlessly receive the favors from her past life, she wouldn’t be able to be carefree in this life!</p>
<p>So Xue Ranran quietly took out a handkerchief, wrapped the unfinished pancakes in it, called the boss to settle the bill, and then said to Su Yishui, “I’m not eating anymore either, let’s go.”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When Su Yishui said these, he was just speaking his mind and didn’t mean to let the girl go hungry. Unexpectedly, she suddenly stopped eating after hearing just that one sentence.</p>
<p>At such a young age, she’s acting like this? Could it be because he was too easygoing before, spoiling this disciple to have such a rebellious attitude?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Su Yishui snorted coldly and didn’t bother to indulge her spoiled attitude, simply got up and left.</p>
<p>Afterward, Ranran really didn’t ask him to stroll around anymore. She just asked the master to have tea and rest in an elegant teahouse, while she went to several shops by herself.</p>
<p>After all, she had gone home and now going back to West Mountain, she had to bring some local specialties for the uncle masters and the senior brothers and sisters. Also, second uncle master’s child would also need some new clothes and toys.</p>
<p>So after buying a round of southern specialties, Ranran returned carrying them.</p>
<p>Su Yishui frowned and asked her what she bought. Ranran enthusiastically listed everything one by one.</p>
<p>The current Sect leader of Xishan became more and more gloomy as he listened. This stupid girl bought so many things, even things for the cats and dogs of West Mountain, but there was nothing for him.</p>
<p>Was it because he didn’t let her eat to her heart’s content earlier, so now she was venting her dissatisfaction?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Actually, Ranran really didn’t mean to. She felt that Su Yishui was now annoyed with her, and if she bought something for him, he probably wouldn’t be pleased with it either. Rather than having to hear his ridicule, it was better not to invite it.</p>
<p>On the rest of the journey, the two didn’t have much to say. When they stopped, Ranran would find a shady spot, quietly drink water from her flask, and eat the somewhat dried-out pancakes.</p>
<p>Su Yishui originally wanted to meditate, but every time he closed his eyes, he couldn’t help but open them and coldly watch the girl hiding to eat.</p>
<p>During the journey, one of the hair ties she used to tie her hair broke, so her long hair was loose, and she simply gathered it up, tying it into a loose braid that hung over her shoulder. Strands of hair fell softly on her face, adding a touch of innocence, and the sunlight filtered through the branches, making her face glow like a pearl and jade sculpture…</p>
<p>When Su Yishui was lost in thought staring, Ranran suddenly looked up at him. When their eyes met, Su Yishui immediately lowered his gaze. But after doing so, he felt why he should feel guilty? What’s wrong with openly looking at his half of the golden core?</p>
<p>Thinking this way, he confidently opened his eyes again. But he found that that damn girl had turned around, facing her back to him as if to ignore him.</p>
<p>She… did she disdain him for looking at her?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran was feeling upset at this moment. When she inadvertently met Su Yishui’s eyes earlier, he immediately closed them in disgust, as if he had seen something dirty.</p>
<p>In fact, all the way here, Su Yishui had been nitpicking at her, his words cold and harsh. It was like the fierce beast in the “Playing Classics” had come to life.</p>
<p>It was also precisely because of this, that Ranran realized how restrained and tolerant Shifu had been before.</p>
<p>She couldn’t remember the various wrongs Su Yishui had done to her in her past life, but she was very grateful for his quiet protection in this life.</p>
<p>In this case, she didn’t want to dig up old grievances, and just wanted to find a way for both of them to get along comfortably.</p>
<p>He seemed to not like to see her eat, so she would just turn her back to him.</p>
<p>When they returned to West Mountain, she would not appear often in front of him. After he got into a better mood, he could take back his golden core, and they would be even.</p>
<p>Thinking that if Su Yishui knew she was Mu Qingge, he would probably treat her worse than he did now. Ranran was so sad, she actually felt like crying.</p>
<p>But, this was also the real Su Yishui, a man who wasn’t bound by gratitude or guilt and acted according to his whims. If he could choose, Ranran guessed that her Shifu might prefer the current feeling of not owing anyone anything?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After walking for a while, they arrived at a mountain pass surrounded by mountains on all sides. The forest here was dense, and the scenery was lush and green.</p>
<p>When passing by a village, Ranran saw from afar several people kneeling and crying at the village’s ancestral hall.</p>
<p>Ranran had originally wanted to go into the village to fetch some water.</p>
<p>But after listening to the cries of those people for a while, she turned back and said, “Shifu, several families’ seven or eight-year-old children went to play in the mountains together, but they haven’t returned. They said that in recent years, there have been monsters eating people in these nearby mountains, and many people from the village have gone missing. So, normally, no one dares to go up the mountain. Now that the children are missing, two families’ men have gone to the town to report, but they haven’t returned, so the women are begging the village’s hunters and brave men to help find the children. But no one dares to go…”</p>
<p>Su Yishui seemed indifferent to these matters and only asked, “Did you get your water?”</p>
<p>Ranran shook her head and looked curiously at the surrounding towering mountains. “Shifu, do you think there really are monsters that eat people?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui replied indifferently, “It’s getting late, let’s hurry and go.”</p>
<p>Ranran knew, that her Shifu was much more indifferent now compared to before, seemingly uninterested in things that didn’t concern him.</p>
<p>However, when she saw the women kneeling and crying at the village entrance, pleading with the village’s hunters to search for their children on the mountain, Ranran still felt somewhat unwilling to turn a blind eye.</p>
<p>She said in a small voice, “Shifu, how about you sit here for a while, and I’ll go up the mountain to take a look.”</p>
<p>Su Yishui suddenly opened his eyes wide and asked coldly, “What do these people have to do with you?”</p>
<p>Ranran blinked and said, “Shifu, didn’t you tell me that *cultivators with higher cultivation levels should bear more responsibility? Not to single-mindedly seek immortality, and forget how to be a human first…”<br/><em>*sorry I thought of with great power, comes great responsibility</em></p>
<p>Su Yishui furrowed his brows. “Did I say that?”</p>
<p>Ranran nodded confidently. Well… actually, it wasn’t something Shifu actually said but rather how she concluded her exemplary master had been living his life before he lost his memory.</p>
<p>After all, back then, he willingly risked his life to rescue the people of the entire capital, avoiding a catastrophic disaster caused by the rampage of the little dragon. If it weren’t for the damn Soul-Cleansing Talisman that was used on Shifu, he would never have let those women cry and weep without any concern.</p>
<p>Su Yishui squinted at the little girl’s teary eyes, unmoved as ever, and said, “Are you cursing me for being inhuman?”</p>
<p>Ranran waved her hands urgently and said earnestly, “Shifu, you are the best person I’ve ever met!”</p>
<p>She said this without any reservation. In this world, besides her parents, there was no one better than her Shifu… Even if he might have harmed her in her past life, she believed she hadn’t misjudged him.</p>
<p>Su Yishui looked at her extremely serious expression, snorted coldly, but still stood up and ordered in a cold voice, “Let’s go.”</p>
<p>Huh? Ranran was a bit puzzled, not knowing what he was up to.</p>
<p>Su Yishui said, “Aren’t you going into the mountains?”</p>
<p>With that, he got up and headed towards the dense mountains. Ranran watched his back, feeling a slight tremor in her heart. It seemed like her tough-looking but soft-hearted Shifu has returned…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Of course, Ranran soon realized that this was just a delusion.</p>
<p>Shortly after entering the mountains, Su Yishui picked a large rock, sat down steadily, and said, “I’ll give you an hour to find them. Don’t take risks that would damage my core.”</p>
<p>It turned out he followed her to constantly watch over the safety of his core, with no intention to search for people.</p>
<p>But what he said wasn’t wrong either, so Ranran quickly closed her eyes and listened to the sounds in the mountains.</p>
<p>Her hearing has always been good. As long as she focused, she could hear the nearby sounds.</p>
<p>But strangely, there was no sound in the entire mountain, except for the cries of deer and birds commonly heard in the mountains. As for the howling of wolves, it came from very far away.</p>
<p>Since the mountain was close to the village, the wild animals were also afraid of people and naturally stayed away from them.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t hear anything unusual, so she lightly stepped and used the Wind Control Technique to quickly patrol the mountains.</p>
<p>Su Yishui got up and jumped onto the tallest tree, sitting on top of it, watching the little butterfly in a pink jacket fluttering up and down. A cold smirk curled at the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p><em>Wasn’t he supposed to teach her how to be a human?</em></p>
<p>Next, he would teach her the first principle of being a human – Never meddle in other people’s business!</p>
<p>There was a dark purple mist in the depths of the mountain… emanating an evil aura…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As for Ranran, she traversed the mountains without finding anything unusual. But when she arrived at a mountain hollow, she suddenly felt heavy miasma here.</p>
<p>Next, her legs seemed to be entangled by some sticky thin threads, almost causing her to fall from the branches. When she steadied herself, she looked closely and found that the trees in this mountain hollow were covered with large spider webs.</p>
<p>Ranran was considered a brave girl, but seeing such large spider webs as large as fishing nets, and a basin-sized spider crawling on them, made her hairs stand on end!</p>
<p>After her legs were entangled in the spider webs, it seemed to trigger movements from all over, and dozens of basin-sized spiders crawled out from various hidden corners.</p>
<p>And Ranran just learned that spiders could make noises too, as they moved their fangs-like mouths rhythmically, emitting a clicking sound, all while moving their eight legs towards Ranran.</p>
<p>Now Ranran no longer needed to draw her sword. She brandished three short swords and swiftly sent them flying towards the big spiders coming at her.</p>
<p>However, at the same time, she also drew out a sword to cut the spider webs entangling her legs, but the webs were sticky and tough, and she couldn’t cut them off no matter how hard she tried.</p>
<p>In her haste, when Ranran looked down, she suddenly saw white skulls all over the ground.</p>
<p>Clearly, the missing villagers were all laid in eternal rest here…</p>
<p>At this moment, more and more spiders were coming from all directions. They spat sticky silk towards Ranran and her short swords flying in the air.</p>
<p>After the short swords, controlled by her vitality qi, were entangled in silk, they couldn’t move anymore.</p>
<p>Even the mechanism stick that Ranran drew out was also entangled with a lot of silk.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>…Su Yi Shui had been sitting on top of the tree all this time, waiting leisurely for Ranran to call for help. After she learned her lesson, he would naturally step in to save her.</p>
<p>But it seemed like the girl’s mouth was also sealed by the spider webs. She just wouldn’t shout for help.</p>
<p>Su Yishui raised his eyebrows, somewhat surprised, and thought: <em>Is she dumber than the other three disciples?</em></p>
<p>Just as a string of large spiders was about to attack for their meal, Ranran suddenly acted quickly. She pulled out three Beast control talismans seized at the border and stuck them on the bodies of three big spiders ready to devour her.</p>
<p>The three spiders immediately stopped their attack, then, under Ranran’s silent control, they turned around and pounced on their own kind.</p>
<p>Ranran pulled out another talisman and stuck it on another spider’s body, letting it move its long legs and untangle the spider silk on her legs.</p>
<p>After breaking free from the siege, Ranran quickly disengaged and didn’t linger in battle anymore. She leaped out of the mountain hollow as if flying and then rushed to the base of the tall tree, shouting, “Shifu, run! There are Spider Demons of the Web Cavern!”</p>
<p>Su Yishui jumped down from the tree, looked down at the young girl with a face full of sweat, and asked, “Why didn’t you shout for help when you were in danger?”</p>
<p>Ranran was stunned, never expecting him to ask this. So she honestly replied, “Those spiders were so sinister, of course I couldn’t call you over. What if you were also entangled and placed in danger?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui had originally thought she was just throwing a girlish tantrum because he didn’t accompany her into the mountains.</p>
<p>But he didn’t expect her to be fearful that he would also be entangled by the spiders, so she didn’t call for him…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>
<p>I wondered why Su Yishui would suddenly feel depressed… after all he didn’t want this disciple around him and sent her away right? Like where did this emotion come from… So maybe its his subconscious reacting to his girlfriend moving out of Western mountain and took all her things lol</p>
<p>Looks like Su Yishui went quite a long way on his ‘moonlight walk’… <br/>hahaha Zeng Yi didn’t move far away enough…</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">新晋同门     NEW INTAKE</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>“Are you saying that I would be afraid of those spiders?”</p>
<p>Ranran wasn’t in the mood to listen to Shifu looking for a fight. She had just noticed the unique patterns on those spiders’ bodies, and there was always a familiar aura that sent shivers down her spine. So she just wanted to quickly take her master out of the mountains, and then warn the villagers below to be wary of those giant spiders.</p>
<p>“Fine fine, my Shifu is the most powerful! He’s not afraid of any spiders or mice!” Ranran followed Su Yishui’s line of thought as if coaxing a child, then grabbed his arm and headed out of the mountains.</p>
<p>They used to be together all day long before, even sharing countless sweet embraces and kisses, so holding hands like this was not a big deal. Moreover, there was a reason for this urgency; she wanted to get him out of there quickly.</p>
<p>But in Su Yi Shui’s current memories, apart from his mother, he had never been so close to anyone else. The recent close contacts with women in his memory were all of Mu Qingge, teasing him.</p>
<p>This Xue Ranran actually pulled him around so impudently, just like her elder sister in her past life!</p>
<p>He couldn’t help but darken his expression, and wanted to shake off her hand.</p>
<p>However, his hand seemed to have a will of its own, automatically grasping her small, slightly calloused hand back, allowing her to lead him out of the mountain this way.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When Ranran mentioned the strangeness of those large spiders, Su Yi Shui was unfazed. “Those are not spiders from the human realm.”</p>
<p>Finally expressing her speculation after hearing Su Yi Shui’s words, Ranran said, “I sensed a dark Netherworld realm aura from those spiders… Could it be that because we opened the Realm, some creatures from there were brought out?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui replied coldly, “People here already started disappearing half a year ago; those creatures have been out for a long time.”</p>
<p>Ranran bit her lip, “What caused these demonic creatures to come out? Can we find a way to eliminate them? Otherwise, they will continue to harm people in the mountains.”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui never bothered with matters unrelated to him. But seeing the girl thinking so seriously, he couldn’t help but remind her, “Didn’t you already come up with a plan to use poison against poison?”</p>
<p>Ranran was startled, suddenly understanding Su Yi Shui’s meaning.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When she went back and observed the situation in the mountain hollow, she found that the three spiders with talismans had already devoured most of their companions, their bodies swelling several times their original size, resembling three grotesque, pig-sized creatures.</p>
<p>“These are Ghost-Headed Spiders from the Netherworld Realm. If not for a famine, they generally coexist peacefully within their kind. However, in times of scarcity, they devour each other, accelerating their own growth in size and demonic nature to become more aggressive, capturing larger prey to survive…”</p>
<p>Ranran sucked in a breath of cold air. It seemed that these normally peaceful Ghost-Headed Spiders, were triggered to bloodlust under the control of the beast-controlling talismans. This led them to devour their kin and, due to absorbing their demonic traits, quickly grow to such massive sizes in such a short time…</p>
<p>Ranran couldn’t tell whether it was easier to deal with a pit full of spiders or three large monstrosities.</p>
<p>After about an incense stick’s worth of time, the hollow was left with only the three spiders that had talismans on them.</p>
<p>Seeing Ranran prepare to deal with the remaining three, this time Su Yi Shui spoke up with a tip, “The Ghost-Headed Spiders are tough all over, but the two spots resembling eyes are the softest; aim for those.”</p>
<p>Ranran nodded vigorously and immediately rushed towards the spider’s den.</p>
<p>At this moment, the spiders, having devoured their kin and grown significantly in size, stood as tall as horses, their eight legs towering. Due to their rapid growth, the talismans on their backs were also dislodged.</p>
<p>When the control of the talismans was lost, the three spiders seemed to stop attacking each other but, due to their increased appetite from their current size, they turned towards their “food storage.”</p>
<p>Only now did Ranran notice several spider sacs hanging on a large tree covered in webs.</p>
<p>As Ranran leaped to the treetop and inspected closely, she found that aside from goose egg-sized round spider eggs inside the sacs, there were also several groggy children!</p>
<p>It seemed they were the lost children the village women had cried about.</p>
<p>Perhaps because they were meant to be food for the hatchlings, these children had not been eaten by the spiders. Instead, they were rendered unconscious by the spider venom, ready to be slaughtered as fresh food, wrapped in the spider sacs.</p>
<p>But now, the three big spiders were too hungry to consider their future generations, so they eagerly extended their long claws to grab the children.</p>
<p>Ranran urgently pulled out her stick, and leaped onto the back of the spider at the back. </p>
<p>This time, she saw what Su Yi Shui meant by the two eye-like patterns. Taking aim at one, she triggered the spring mechanism on the stick, piercing it fiercely.</p>
<p>This spot, indeed softer than the hard exoskeleton, struck the spider’s vital point, causing it to emit a sharp shriek.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t slack off, continuing the same tactic. With her agile movements, she quickly struck the vital spots on the remaining two big spiders.</p>
<p>The three spiders were pierced deeply, instantly collapsing like deflated balloons, their dark green liquid splattering everywhere.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>At that moment, Ranran suddenly felt a wave of dizziness, and her body swayed slightly. She silently recited her mental mantra, regaining stability. Ever since she returned from the Netherworld Realm, she would feel dizzy now and then. At first, she didn’t mind, thinking it was due to transplanting the Rebirth Tree, but recently, the dizzy spells had become more frequent…</p>
<p>Once Ranran steadied herself, she gently set down the children who were gradually awakening.</p>
<p>The children looked around in confusion, seeing the hellish scene around them, and began to cry in confusion, hugging this beautiful big sister and wailing loudly.</p>
<p>Ranran relaxed and gathered the children around her, comforting them with gentle words.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui walked over silently at this time, standing aside. Suddenly, he found the scene in front of him somewhat familiar… in the past Mu Qingge also used to comfort the children she adopted like this, using such tactics to win people’s hearts…</p>
<p>He suddenly felt a pang in his heart, unwilling to think further. He just strode over, picked up a purple bead the size of a walnut from the messy spider goo, and examined it. The bead exuded a black mist, giving off an ominous aura.</p>
<p>Ranran also stood up and looked at the bead, asking, “What is that?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui examined the bead and murmured, “Someone must have deliberately nurtured these spiders to cultivate these demonic pills…”</p>
<p>After hearing this, Ranran drew out a dagger and cut open another dead spider. Sure enough, there was a purple demonic pill inside its body as well.</p>
<p>The appearance of demonic creatures from the Netherworld Realm in the human realm was highly unusual; they turned out to be the oysters cultivating demonic pills, which was mind-boggling to think about.</p>
<p>Ranran suddenly remembered the Immortal-Devouring Bugs. That thing was also not from the human realm and, when it appeared in Tianmai Mountain, it had likely already been nurtured by someone for twenty years.</p>
<p>Could these spiders also be the work of that Emperor Su Yu?</p>
<p>Ranran wrapped the purple demonic pills in a handkerchief and then sent the frightened children back to the village.</p>
<p>The families of those children hugged them in tears of joy, repeatedly thanking the female immortal.</p>
<p>When Ranran asked when people started disappearing in the mountains, the village elders strained to remember, recalling that it was about three years ago when a ball of fire fell from the sky one night, dazzlingly bright, landing in the mountains.</p>
<p>At that time, some curious young men ventured into the mountains to see, but only one returned. He was so frightened that he had wet himself, saying there were monsters in the mountains that ate people.</p>
<p>Later, they reported to the authorities and invited Taoist priests to exorcise the monsters, but nothing worked. People continued to disappear in the mountains, and gradually, apart from passersby, no locals dared to venture into the mountains.</p>
<p>If these naive children hadn’t met the kind female immortal, they might have also gone missing without a trace.</p>
<p>After hearing this, Ranran couldn’t find any more clues. The villagers were very warm and insisted on keeping Ranran while they slaughter pigs and sheep.</p>
<p>Knowing that Su Yi Shui disliked getting close to people, Ranran took advantage of the village chief’s distraction and vanished like a bird.</p>
<p>This made the villagers kneel again, towards the skies, thanking the female immortal for her miraculous appearance.</p>
<p>Apart from knowing that demonic creatures from the Netherworld Realm had leaked out, there were no other leads.</p>
<p>Ranran thought about how many demonic creatures might be lurking in the abyss of the Netherworld Realm, and her heart sank.</p>
<p>Those purple demonic pills didn’t have much benefit for righteous cultivators. However, for those on the demonic path, they were treasures to enhance their cultivation and demonic power.</p>
<p>Someone must have deliberately nurtured these demonic spiders, and specifically released these Ghost-Headed Spiders on the mountain behind the village.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The rest of the journey after this, went rather smoothly. When the master and disciple finally returned to West Mountain, the two uncle masters saw Ranran’s return and were genuinely happy. Although their master had lost his memory, he still doted on Ranran, finally bringing her back at last.</p>
<p>After replanting the Rebirth Tree, Qiu Xier helped water the tree while talking excitedly, “Do you know? Shifu is recruiting disciples again, this time it’s an open selection, the influence is comparable to the three major sects recruiting disciples.”</p>
<p>West Mountain’s reputation was not low now, and Su Yi Shui’s name was indistinctly even more prominent than the three major sects.</p>
<p>After returning from the Netherworld Realm, Su Yi Shui suddenly changed his approach, wanting to recruit capable disciples. Therefore, a month ago, he spread the news, attracting talents from all directions to the mountain gate.</p>
<p>However, this time Su Yi Shui’s method of selecting disciples was exceptionally strict, focusing on bone structure and spiritual power.</p>
<p>Just the first batch of bone readings eliminated more than half of the candidates. Adding Su Yi Shui’s disdain for people from the three major sects, after another round of careful selection, he eliminated those from the three sects that tried to switch over.</p>
<p>So, those who passed this rigorous selection were young with excellent bone readings, including some handsome young men.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier had been gloomy because Shifu had neglected them. They chose to stay behind back then, and didn’t leave with Uncle master Zeng and Ranran. After the two uncle masters interceded for them, they were brought back to West Mountain, but rather than disciples, they were treated more like servants who did labor.</p>
<p>Shifu no longer taught them as before, only letting them fetch water and chop wood, feeling like they had returned to their early days starting out in West Mountain.</p>
<p>Fortunately, now that a batch of fresh and talented disciples had arrived, Qiu Xier felt that Spring had finally arrived in West Mountain. So, in excitement, she specifically took Ranran to the martial arts field to show her the outstanding ones among the new intake of disciples.</p>
<p>Among them, one person stood out the most. When Ranran looked over, she found that the young man named Shen Kuo was indeed exceptionally handsome.</p>
<p>Tall and with a refined appearance, he always had a hint of a smile on his face, and was very likable.</p>
<p>There was also someone named Yue Sheng who was good too, rumored to come from a noble family, carrying the air of an independent wealthy young master.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>While Qiu Xier and Ranran watched the disciples under the tree, those young men suddenly gathered around Shen Kuo and Yue Sheng, pointing and whispering towards Ranran and Qiu Xier, bursting into laughter now and then.</p>
<p>Shen Kuo was more composed, he only glanced up and then lowered his head.</p>
<p>However, the one named Yue Sheng stared at Xue Ranran for a long time.</p>
<p>Feeling uncomfortable being stared at by those young men, Ranran pulled her senior sister away quickly, ignoring the young men laughingly calling out, “Senior sister, wait!”</p>
<p>Qiu Xier was a little unsatisfied, “Aren’t we all from the same Sect? What’s wrong with saying hello when we meet? Why are you running away?”</p>
<p>Ranran said, “The food was still cooking in the pot when you dragged me here, of course, I have to rush back to check it! You’re so excited watching the junior brothers; if senior brother sees you like this, be careful lest he might ignore you!”</p>
<p>Senior brother and third senior sister had a good relationship, although they hadn’t talked about marriage yet, it was just a matter of time. Ranran naturally wanted to remind her senior sister not to be fickle.</p>
<p>Ranran was right, Gao Cang and Bai Baishan were quite uncomfortable with these newcomers. <br/>Did Shifu think they were useless and was ready to favor these new disciples? Would they never be able to improve on their cultivation and just spend their days chopping wood and fetching water?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran herself didn’t mind the newcomers to West Mountain; although Shifu no longer taught her personally either, she had reached the stage where she could cultivate her foundation on her own.</p>
<p>The saying “the master leads the way, the practice is personal” was true.</p>
<p>During her time in the Netherworld Realm, she had been torn by the dual forces of Yin and Yang when entering and leaving, which weakened her spiritual energy for a while. Coupled with dizziness and shortness of breath, she is in need of regulation.</p>
<p>Now that she’s been brought back to West Mountain by Su Yi Shui, she has the opportunity to repair her true vitality in the Ice Lotus Pool.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, West Mountain suddenly had many junior brothers of unknown names, and the various large rooms and courtyards that had been empty for a long time were now in use.</p>
<p>For now, there was a constant stream of people, and she couldn’t leisurely enter the pool during the day like before. When Ranran was taking a walk by the pool during the day, she ran into several junior brothers, including Shen Kuo.</p>
<p>Ranran’s reputation was very prominent, and many junior brothers had long admired this senior sister. Now that they finally had the opportunity, they eagerly introduced themselves.</p>
<p>However, Shen Kuo didn’t step forward. He was quite tall, so even standing behind, he could still meet Ranran’s eyes. When he smiled shyly and looked at fourth senior sister… well, Ranran also thought this young man looked really good!</p>
<p>Since there were so many people around the pool during the day, Ranran could only wait patiently until nightfall. When the senior brothers started meditating in the halls and stopped moving around randomly, she stealthily took a large scarf and wore a loose robe, and sneaked to the Ice Lotus Pool.</p>
<p>Although it was dark, the Ice Lotus Pool was glowing faintly in the night, its white petals like carved ice, reflecting colorful lights in the water.</p>
<p>When she slipped into the water, enveloped by the aura-filled water, she felt like a thirsty little tree finally relaxing and absorbing more water.</p>
<p>She stretched her body as she leaned against a large stone by the pool, and hummed a song softly, her nightingale-like voice echoing lightly above the lotus pond.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When Su Yi Shui stood by the back window of his bedroom, what caught his eye was the sight of a girl with long hair bathing and humming in the Lotus Pool.</p>
<p>Although it was night, her small face was illuminated by the Ice Lotus, shining brightly.</p>
<p>Even though he was somewhat far away, he could still see her expressive eyebrows and eyes, the slight curve of her lips… she was a girl who, with just one glance, made people feel sweetness, like the honey-preserved plums she made, addictive and leaving a sweet-sour aftertaste.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui considered himself not lustful of women, but for some reason, he kept watching the girl soaking in the pool for a long while.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>He felt that there were too many windows in his bedroom. The front window of his room directly faced the courtyard where Ranran lived. When he woke and glanced up, he could see her watering the flowers and trees in the courtyard.</p>
<p>The window on the east faced the West Mountain’s practice field. During the day, he had seen Ranran and Qiu Xier watching the young men under the tree, which didn’t escape his notice.</p>
<p>And the window on the west faced the Lotus Pool, which seemed to be a place Ranran often visited. During the day, when he was looking at the back mountain, he saw her loitering around the Lotus Pool several times and greeting the junior brothers passing by.</p>
<p>Perhaps when young people gathered together, they always had something to talk about. If one focused and listened, they seemed to be complimenting Ranran’s youth and talent, how her reputation has grown since Tianmai Mountain, and so on.</p>
<p>However, every single one of them were quite presumptuous, staring intently at their senior sister, looking like they were lacking sisterly affection.</p>
<p>At that moment, Su Yi Shui’s gaze turned cold, suddenly feeling that the disciples he had chosen seemed to have limited horizons. Such a lack of experience would probably not cultivate any good seedlings.</p>
<p>So he seriously considered, whether to re-select disciples.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>And now seeing Ranran being so bold, taking a bath in the pool in the middle of the night, Su Yi Shui seemed to regain his long-neglected authority as a master, and strode towards the pool with a stern face.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the poolside in his white robe, Ranran had just come out of the pool. She had wrapped herself in a large scarf and was using a towel to dry her wet hair.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui walked silently, and Ranran didn’t notice his arrival. She was drying her hair when she accidentally bumped into Su Yi Shui’s arms.</p>
<p>When her soft body entered his embrace, Su Yi Shui couldn’t help but feel a jolt in his heart. Habitually, his body acted a step ahead, firmly encircling her in his arms.</p>
<p>Ranran got a shock and thought she had encountered a lecher. She was about to summon her spiritual energy to push the offender away when she looked up and saw that the person holding her was actually Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>Shifu’s long hair was half-tied, with his sword-like brows, eyes like stars, and his tall nose that had rubbed against her cheek countless times… she hadn’t seen his face up close like this in a long time.</p>
<p>For a moment, Ranran was a little confused. Thinking that Su Yi Shui had remembered everything, tears welled up in her eyes uncontrollably, and with a hint of a crying tone, she called out “Shifu…”</p>
<p>But this voice seemed to rouse Su Yishui, and he suddenly came to his senses, reaching out to push Ranran away.</p>
<p>Ranran was unprepared and took several steps back. If she hadn’t grabbed the nearby bamboo, she would have fallen down.</p>
<p>Su Yishui reached out to steady her, but this time, Ranran stepped back and avoided him.</p>
<p>He didn’t know why he felt a surge of displeasure in his heart. “Its the middle of the night and you’re taking a bath here? Don’t you know there are many men on the mountain?”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran knew then that Shifu hadn’t recovered. She stood up straight, lowered her head, and said softly, “I deliberately waited until nightfall to come here. I didn’t expect that Shifu would also come… shouldn’t you be practicing and meditating with the juniors?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui frowned at her and suddenly asked, “You’re rather capable, actually able to soak in the Ice Lotus? Who brought the Ice Lotus to West Mountain?”</p>
<p>Ranran quickly glanced up at him, surprised that he had even forgotten about the Ice Lotus.</p>
<p>It made sense; this was related to memories with Mu Qingge. Back then, when he was almost falling into darkness, Mu Qingge had found the Ice Lotus and soaked with him to alleviate his demonic nature.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t want to mention anything related to her past life in front of Su Yi Shui, so she replied indifferently to his inquiry, “Shifu, you should ask second uncle master about these things. I’ll go back now and won’t come to soak in this pool in the future…”</p>
<p>With that, she turned to leave.</p>
<p>But unexpectedly, Su Yi Shui grabbed her hand again, feeling her pulse carefully with his long fingers. His furrowed brow tightened even more.</p>
<p>“Why is your pulse so unstable?” he asked directly.</p>
<p>Ranran thought for a moment and said, “It has been like this since I returned from the Netherworld. I originally thought it was because I was away from the Rebirth Tree for too long, but later I realized it wasn’t… But now I’m much better.”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui finally understood why she came to soak in the Ice Lotus in the middle of the night. For some unknown reason, she had some imbalance in her yin and yang meridians while in the netherworld, so soaking in the Ice Lotus was very beneficial for her body.</p>
<p>This girl had been unwell for so long, but she hadn’t shown it at all on the way back with him. No wonder she accidentally injured her arm when she fought with the Ghost-Head Spider…</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Su Yi Shui thought back to what he had reprimanded Ranran for earlier, and he tightly pursed his lips.</p>
<p>No matter how much he disliked her now, she was still his disciple after all. He couldn’t just watch her languish and die, could he?</p>
<p>Since he had given her half of his golden core, she must live up to his painstaking efforts!</p>
<p>With that in mind, Su Yi Shui said, “The effectiveness of the Ice Lotus is weaker at night. You should come to soak during daytime tomorrow.”</p>
<p>After saying that, he left gracefully with a sweep of his long sleeves.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran looked at his back in confusion, blinked her eyes. Soak during the day? Was she supposed to chat with the junior brothers while soaking wet from the pool?</p>
<p>However, the next day, Ranran understood what Su Yi Shui meant. The Lotus Pool on the back mountain became a forbidden area, and no one except Ranran was allowed to enter.</p>
<p>As she bathed in the sunlight, leisurely swimming in the Lotus Pool, she felt that although Shifu had temporarily forgotten about her, he still loved his disciples so dearly.</p>
<p>When she emerged from the water, wiping off the water droplets, she happened to see the cold-eyed man standing not far away by the window on the second floor, seemingly looking in her direction. Ranran couldn’t help but wave at him, but the man turned and disappeared like a gust of wind at the window…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>
<p>It’s really quite funny to see SYS16 was going through the same jealousy phase that SYS38 had gone through. <br/>16 since that is the age when he still hated Mu Qingge when he was newly recruited to Xishan?<br/>Was SYS 18 when his father rebelled? </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">该不该罚</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Ranran sighed silently in her heart and reminded herself once again: Shifu is no longer the same, and she should remember to maintain some distance, to avoid his disgust.</p>
<p>But the days back in Xishan were much more plentiful than before.</p>
<p>At the very least, the amount of food to be cooked was several times more than before.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui recruited ten disciples this time. Plus the previous four, there were a total of fourteen disciples now.</p>
<p>If you counted Shifu and the uncle masters, that was nearly twenty people to feed. Most of these people were seventeen or eighteen years old, and they all had good appetites, still far from reaching the stage of fasting!</p>
<p>Handling three meals a day for so many people daily was too much for second uncle master Yutong. Apart from Ranran, she had to call on Qiu Xier, Gaocang, and Bai Baishan to help.</p>
<p>The two girls were still alright, as they were used to doing these things daily anyway. But Gao Cang and Bai Baishan were very unhappy.</p>
<p>Now, they couldn’t even get close to the training ground, and they had to spend the whole day in the kitchen, preparing meals endlessly.</p>
<p>Seeing those newcomers getting the master’s true teachings and spending their days meditating in the grass hall or practicing martial arts in the training ground, naturally, they felt unhappy.</p>
<p>But those new disciples were very diligent. Since Xue Ranran came back, several young boys would voluntarily come to help out in the kitchen.</p>
<p>The ones who were fresh-looking, quick with their hands, and sweet-talkers were particularly popular.</p>
<p>Just like now, Ranran is picking flat beans, and the youth named Yue Sheng came over, carrying a stool and sitting next to senior sister Xue.</p>
<p>At this moment, he didn’t show the demeanor of a noble young master. From time to time, he would chat with senior sister Xue, asking about her adventures on Tianmai Mountain and expressing his admiration as a junior brother now and then.</p>
<p>Eventually, the other two juniors also came over, listening to Xue Shijie talk, while eagerly watching her lively eyes and sweet smile.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When they first came to the mountain, they had only heard of this senior sister’s name but hadn’t seen her in person.</p>
<p>When senior Sister returned with the master, and they saw her for the first time in the training ground, they were amazed by her beauty.</p>
<p>Fourth senior sister was actually this beautiful!</p>
<p>Moreover, she was different from those mediocre senior brothers. She was the chosen daughter of the heavens, who had entered the Marrow-Cleansing Pool.</p>
<p>They wondered if she had any intention of finding a fellow cultivator to become a couple with in the future? And if she would look for one among her fellow disciples?</p>
<p>After all, they were all in the same sect. As the saying goes the one closest often gets the most opportunities. Practicing together and being together everyday, also made things more comfortable.</p>
<p>For a time, there were many young men who had these kind of thoughts. In addition to practicing, they all wanted to catch a glimpse of senior sister’s figure by the corridor pool on Xishan.</p>
<p>But this senior sister was a little too shy and didn’t really want to talk to them.</p>
<p>Therefore the time spent helping in the kitchen was particularly delightful. After all, in the cramped kitchen, senior sister had to talk whether she wanted to or not.</p>
<p>So the benches in the Xishan kitchen were rather insufficient. In the end, even second uncle master was “invited” out by her filial nephews, and they took care of everything in the kitchen!</p>
<p>However, Gao Cang refused to leave. He watched Qiu Xier smiling sweetly at these junior brothers, so he vented his anger by fiercely chopping white radishes with a knife.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t think much about these young men who were close to her age. She treated them all as younger brothers, smiling and chatting with them without much thought.</p>
<p>This harmonious atmosphere continued to the dining table.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui no longer ate with his disciples now. His meals were brought to the study by Yutong.</p>
<p>And the two uncle masters also didn’t eat with the younger generation anymore either. They remained in the study to serve the master.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>So the large dining hall was filled with the younger generation disciples of Xishan.</p>
<p>Three tables were set up, each table could seat five to six people. But the table where Xue Ranran sat was particularly crowded, squeezing in eight people.</p>
<p>Gao Cang couldn’t even spread his chopsticks and couldn’t reach the dishes. He was so angry that he slammed the chopsticks down and said, “Is there more meat in the bowls on this table than on the others? Why do they all have to squeeze in here, can they let others eat or not?”</p>
<p>Initially, these young men still had some respect for the senior brothers of Xishan, after all, Gao Cang and the others were the first to join and had to be respected.</p>
<p>But in the past month, the new disciples had also sensed something — Master didn’t really care about these previous disciples, which was why he had made such a big deal out of recruiting new ones.</p>
<p>Moreover, Gao Cang and the others have very shallow foundations. There were several occasions when they couldn’t resist showing off their skills outside the training ground, but these new disciples with superior aptitude noticed their flaws right away.</p>
<p>Gao Cang and the others couldn’t even enter the training ground now; they were just rough laborers in Xishan.</p>
<p>People like that were eating at the same table as them, they hadn’t complained about him, so what right did he have to slam down his chopsticks and lecture them?</p>
<p>Yue Sheng was, apart from Shen Kuo, the best disciple in terms of foundation. Like Shen Kuo, although he hadn’t joined the three major sects, he came from a cultivation family. Plus, he had encountered opportunities and had already opened his meridians early, reaching the second stage of Foundation Building at the age of eighteen.</p>
<p>So the new disciples regarded him and Shen Kuo as leaders among them.</p>
<p>These days when he went to help in the kitchen, Yue Sheng was often teased by Bai Baishan’s words, with Gao Cang was always chiming in. Yue Sheng had already developed some resentment.</p>
<p>Now, being scolded by Gao Cang in front of Xue Shijie, Yue Sheng felt his face burning and stood up coldly, saying, “Is this table reserved for you? Why do you get to sit here? If you feel crowded, can’t you sit at the other tables?”</p>
<p>Gao Cang was sitting at this table because Qiu Xier was here. And Qiu Xier was inseparable from Xue Ranran. Plus there were many handsome young men at this table, so she naturally refused to leave!</p>
<p>But he couldn’t reveal these complicated reasons.</p>
<p>Back then Shifu had clearly stated that he and Bai Baishan were not allowed to flirt with the junior sisters. The ambiguous affection of young people was all implied.</p>
<p>In front of Qiu Xier, bring ridiculed by a junior who just started is intolerable!</p>
<p>Their argument escalated gradually, voices growing louder. The insults became more and more intense, with words like ‘greenhorn,”rice bucket who entered first’, ‘useless old-timer,’ and similar phrases flying back and forth.</p>
<p>Finally, when they were both yelling and wrestling each other, Qiu Xier couldn’t stand it anymore. She gave a shout and rushed over to help Gao Cang scratch Yue Sheng.</p>
<p>Several young men who were close to Yue Sheng also refused to back down, coming over to confront Qiu Xier. Even Bai Baishan, who was usually congenial and calm, couldn’t take it anymore and joined the fray.</p>
<p>When he found himself grappling with someone and his hands were occupied, he unexpectedly threw his shoes. His agile feet, well-trained, aimed straight for the nostrils of the younger disciples!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Yue Sheng got a whiff of his toes and cried out in anger. Enraged, he gathered his inner energy and attacked Bai Baishan.</p>
<p>Since Bai Baishan had stopped cultivating after being under Uncle master Zeng Yi’s care, his dantian was quite depleted. If he was hit by Yue Sheng, he would probably have coughed up blood and been injured.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran acted quickly and cleverly, flipping over a table to push Bai Baishan’s away. She then grabbed a plate of peanuts from the table and applying a little inner energy, struck the knee paralyzing acupoints of several people with just three to four peanuts.</p>
<p>As a result, those youths didn’t have time to react and all ended up kneeling on the ground.</p>
<p>By now, Yue Sheng’s eyes were red with anger, and he didn’t care anymore about seniority or respect. He shouted at Xue Ranran, “You’re actually helping those bastards. Quickly release me, the young master…”</p>
<p>As a result, their smiling and gentle senior sister did come over, not to release his acupoint but to raise her hand and give Yue Sheng a resounding slap.</p>
<p>“Whose ‘young master’ are you? You’re not even close to being a master here on Xishan!” Xue Ranran’s face was no longer smiling, and her stern small face actually carried a hint of chilling aura.</p>
<p>Yue Sheng still continued to glare, but Xue Ranran coldly continued, “In the rules of Xishan, there has never been one which allowed the disruption of the normal order, where juniors can use their abilities to bully their seniors. If it’s just a physical fight, just use fists and legs, but you actually used true energy to ambush someone! Do you want to kill second senior brother? If you are so capable, why did you come to apprentice? People like you, when your abilities grow, won’t you end up bullying your mentors and destroying your ancestors?”</p>
<p>Yue Sheng’s face turned red, gritting his teeth, “If I did something wrong, Master will teach me, who are you to lecture me?”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran laughed, feeling that these half-grown youths were sometimes like unreasonable children, always unwilling to admit their mistakes. So she bent down, looked at the kneeling Yue Sheng who couldn’t move on the ground, and flicked his forehead with her finger, smiling as she said, “Because I’m more skilled than you!”</p>
<p>Now Yue Sheng not only blushed, but his eyes were also red. He had always thought his foundation was good, but when Xue Ranran’s peanuts flew over, he couldn’t even react and failed to dodge them.</p>
<p>Being chastened in a demeaning tone by a woman and flicked on the forehead, such humiliation was enough to make one’s dantian explode…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>“Is everyone done making a scene?” At that moment, a cold voice suddenly came from the door way.</p>
<p>Everyone looked up and shrank their necks. Without them realizing, Su Yi Shui had already appeared at the entrance, looking at them coldly.</p>
<p>This time, there was no more dinner to be had.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui didn’t even bother to ask for reasons; he just ordered them all to go down the mountain to fetch water and fill a dried-up pond halfway up the mountain.</p>
<p>Everyone was dumbfounded, wanting to wail but not daring to.</p>
<p>When the others have all run off unwillingly, Su Yi Shui cast a glance over at Ranran who was still standing there without moving.</p>
<p>“Don’t you hear what I just said? Why aren’t you going?” Su Yi Shui’s tone was icy, with a hint of anger in his eyes.</p>
<p>But only he knew that the inexplicable anger bursting out of him wasn’t because his disciples were disobedient.</p>
<p>It was because the scene just now had seemed familiar, stirring up his long-held anger—Young Su Yi Shui remembered deeply how he had also been flicked on the forehead by an arrogant female demoness.</p>
<p>She was smiling at the time, and said, “What? Are you still dissatisfied after I criticized you? Since my abilities are greater than yours, you should obediently listen to me…”</p>
<p>Similar tone, similar situation, all ignited his anger, so Su Yi Shui’s tone towards Xue Ranran was quite harsh.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But who would have thought that the usually obedient little girl who always followed his instructions, would raise her head high this time and speak firmly, “I haven’t done anything wrong, why should I be punished?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui smiled instead of getting angry. “If you’re not wrong, whose fault is it?”</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t back down. “Discord among disciples, disrespect for seniors, infighting among fellow sect members, naturally, it’s your fault as the master!”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui looked at her coldly and suddenly grabbed her by the *back, gritting his teeth. “Say that again?”<br/>*命门 <em>a point on the lower back where energy is focused and circulated during movements and exercises.</em></p>
<p>Ranran knew he wasn’t just bluffing, the current Shifu, was different from the soft-hearted master she knew before.</p>
<p>But she remained fearless and calmly said, “Shifu, when you accepted Gao Cang and the others, their innate talents were already like this, you weren’t deceived. You said back then that accepting disciples is about fate, they are all people destined to be with you, so regardless of their talents, you will teach them wholeheartedly. Although you seem to have forgotten the past, they are indeed your disciples. Just like adopted children, how can you abandon them easily?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui said coldly, “I didn’t kick these useless people out, are they not still on Xishan?”</p>
<p>But Ranran still calmly retorted, “Why do Yue Sheng and the others have no respect for senior brothers? It’s all because of your contempt for them, only letting them do menial tasks but not allowing them to train with you. For young cultivators, this is not just punishment, it’s also humiliation! But what did they do wrong? They followed you in dangerous situations, even if their abilities are lacking, they never backed down when facing demons and monsters. Even after you became irritable due to the Spirit Spring’s possession, mocking and ridiculing them often, they had never thought of leaving. Now, they are being looked down upon and bullied by the juniors, but you didn’t differentiate right from wrong. You punished them all without a valid reason, why should I accept the punishment to fetch water?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui laughed, mocking the rare display of obstinacy by the girl before him. “Just because my skills are greater than yours! Isn’t that enough reason for you to be punished?”</p>
<p>Ranran knew Su Yi Shui was using her own words against her.</p>
<p>Ranran rarely showed her stubbornness, but once she did, nothing could sway her. She coldly said, “Your skills are indeed greater than mine, but a mistake is still a mistake. Masters can make mistakes, its nothing, and they don’t even need to admit it to their disciples. I just don’t know if there are enough dried-up ponds on Xishan, in case you punish disciples again in future without a legitimate reason!”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui usually had a deep sense of composure, even when he was angry, his face would still remain cold. However, at this moment, he was truly exasperated by this eloquent girl. Just as he was about to raise his hand, Yuchen and Yutong rushed over and quickly separated the master and disciple. Yutong scolded Ranran loudly for speaking nonsense and then secretly gave her a signal to leave quickly.</p>
<p>Although the master had a smile on his face just now, his eyes were full of killing intent, obviously driven mad by anger because of Ranran.</p>
<p>To avoid the tragic drama of the master killing his disciple at Xishan, as her uncle master, she naturally had to step in and ward off the disaster for this little girl, urgently separating these two.</p>
<p>Ranran was also beside herself today. After speaking her mind, she felt slightly better, so she took this opportunity to leave and quickly ran back to her room.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>By now, the sun was setting. The other disciples had all gone down the mountain to fetch water, leaving the courtyard empty.</p>
<p>Now that Ranran’s anger had subsided, she laid down weakly under the young rebirth tree in the courtyard, looking up at the green leaves swaying in the wind. She murmured, “Today, Shifu will probably come to uproot you, and then we will both go to the *underworld together…”<br/>*黄泉<em> is land of the dead</em></p>
<p>Thinking of this, Ranran still did not regret her impulsiveness earlier.</p>
<p>She was sincere about everything she said. Rather than being disappointed in her Shifu, but more like hoping “master” would improve, wanting him to live up to expectations.<br/>*恨铁不成钢 <em>literally hating iron for not becoming steel</em></p>
<p>She hoped her rebuke would make her Shifu come round , in case he recovered from effects of the soul cleansing talisman and would regret how he had treated the senior brothers.</p>
<p>But upon careful thought, the rules of Xishan were already deviant. Didn’t Su Yi Shui also become arrogant when his abilities grew, eventually toppling her, his former master?</p>
<p>In this sense, Yue Sheng and the others were just following Su Yi Shui’s teachings. If they had no respect for their elders and became arrogant with growing abilities, would they end up killing their master to prove their Dao?</p>
<p>Will the rules of Xishan will have to be rewritten in the future? Without killing one’s master, one cannot graduate as a disciple! But then, then there won’t be enough masters to go around. Writing the rules is indeed a skill…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Lost in her thoughts, she lazily lay under the tree, waiting. But there was no angry Su Yi Shui, coming to settle the score. Instead, second uncle master brought food over to her.</p>
<p>“Even if you are angry with your master, you shouldn’t skip meals?</p>
<p>Ranran got up and asked Yutong tentatively “Second uncle master… Has Shifu cooled down yet?”</p>
<p>Yutong looked at her cautiously probing expression and couldn’t help but laugh in annoyance, “So you actually know fear? How come you were talking back like you were courting death just now?”</p>
<p>Ranran grinned sheepishly and didn’t say anything, just took the bowl and chopsticks and ate heartily. Tonight, she had stewed a soup for four hours, and it would be a pity not to eat it.</p>
<p>After finishing the meal, the unpleasant feeling in her heart also nearly dissipated. Ranran was never one to dwell too long in melancholy. She took out the second volume of the Fantian Records that she carried with her and started flipping through it page by page.</p>
<p>Back when she and Shifu were lurking in the Gao Kan camp on the front lines, she had heard Mu Ranwu telling Tu Jiuyuan that she needed more talismans.</p>
<p>This indicated that Elder Jiu wasn’t with Mu Ranwu but in the hands of the Crimson Gate. And the spiders behind the village and the incomplete words left by Elder Jiu back then still had no solution.</p>
<p>Now, even though Shifu is freed of the Spirit Spring, but his mind was still not sharp. Naturally, she couldn’t expect him to venture into the Crimson Gate and rescue Elder Jiu.</p>
<p>So Ranran thought about whether she could find some clues again, but as she read, she felt exhausted, so she lay down under the tree and fell asleep with her eyes closed.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As for Gao Cang and the others who went down the mountain to fetch water, when they heard that Ranran had argued with the master, and refused to go fetch water, everyone gasped in shock.</p>
<p>Finally, when they returned after fetching water, Qiu Xier couldn’t help but worry, “Ranran, since Shifu already favors the new disciples, now you openly defied his orders, won’t that just make him dislike you even more?”</p>
<p>Ranran shook her head and said indifferently “Anyway he already dislikes me, so might as well speak my mind honestly. If I can persuade Shifu to treat you better, that would be best. If not, being driven out of the sect is also fine. Then I’ll just go back home and farm, with no regrets in my heart…”</p>
<p>These are truly Ranran’s heartfelt words. If Shifu cannot treat the disciples well, there’s no need to delay Gao Cang and their future.</p>
<p>The Foundation Establishment stage during a cultivator’s youth is crucial. Spending time in the kitchen dulls their sharpness, and the eldest senior brother and the others might truly end up being unproductive for life.</p>
<p>But it seems that her words, aside from being scorned by others, had no effect. The eldest senior brother and the others still suffered punishment for a night, leaving them sore and tired.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>However, after a day passed, when Ranran was baking biscuits in the small kitchen, she suddenly heard Gao Cang calling excitedly at the window, “Ranran, come quickly, Shifu has asked us to meditate in the grass hall!”</p>
<p>Ranran hesitatingly took off her apron, and followed everyone into the hall. Sure enough, both old and new disciples were gathered, all here for their cultivation exercises.</p>
<p>The aftermath of filling the dried-up pond was significant. Now, the new disciples were looking at Gao Cang and the others with unfriendly eyes , and when they sat down there was a clear division, with the middle aisle acting as a boundary.</p>
<p>Ranran was afraid of angering Su Yi Shui, so she deliberately chose to sit behind Gao Cang on a grass mat, using the eldest senior brother’s towering figure as a wall, shielding her completely.</p>
<p>Before long, Su Yi Shui arrived in a simple and elegant robe. Now, he no longer dressed simply in old clothes. His clothes, crown accessory on his head, and even the jade pendant at his waist were all exquisite, and look like they were quite expensive.</p>
<p>Ranran had to admit that this more refined Shifu looked even more handsome and extraordinary.</p>
<p>Ranran was avoiding the master, but Su Yi Shui didn’t even glance at her when he entered. After everyone sat down, he briefly explained today’s exercises for Foundation Establishment before starting the practice.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>However, the Foundation Establishment method Su Yi Shui was teaching now was completely different from what he taught Gao Cang and the others before. It was more complex and profound, requiring a high level of comprehension to circulate qi through the meridians.</p>
<p>Ranran tried to follow along, and she had to admit that although Su Yi Shui’s current teaching was difficult to comprehend, but once understood, it could greatly improve one’s cultivation in a short time.</p>
<p>But for Gao Cang and Ranran, Bai Baishan too, it was particularly challenging. It was like always running on a smooth broad road, thinking one was running well, only to suddenly come to a steep cliff. Not to mention running, even climbing would be very difficult.</p>
<p>While the other new disciples were smoothly circulating their qi with steam rising from their heads, the old disciples remained unchanged, showing no signs of gathering true qi.</p>
<p>Even Ranran herself tried several times to circulate her vitality qi but had to give up because she felt blockages in her meridians recently.</p>
<p>After two hours, Su Yi Shui suddenly opened his eyes and looked at the several senior disciples who showed no progress, saying coldly, “As disciples who have entered the sect first, being lax in your exercises and falling behind, such laziness, should you not be punished?”</p>
<p>When Su Yi Shui said this, the new disciples couldn’t help but show gloating expressions, taking joy in their seniors’ misfortune.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui then looked straight towards Ranran, who was hiding behind Gao Cang, his gaze piercing.</p>
<p>Gao Cang couldn’t bear it and silently shifted the cushion under his buttocks, revealing his little junior sister behind him rather heartlessly.</p>
<p>Ranran lifted her head and cast a glance at him, but Su Yi Shui continued to stare at her, waiting for her response.</p>
<p>Ranran sighed, somewhat understanding the meaning of “Seek revenge for even a small grievance ” from “Playing Classics”.</p>
<p>But there was indeed nothing to protest about this punishment, so she simply said, “Shifu is right, we will accept the punishment!”</p>
<p>Then the four of them slinked out of the hall, ready to drain the pond everyone had just filled.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">自生自灭</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p><br/>When they left the hall and headed towards the pond, Qiu Xier couldn’t help but say in tears, “Is Shifu intentionally making life difficult for us? If he really can’t stand us, I’ll voluntarily leave the mountain. This daily water-fetching routine, is not for humans!”</p>
<p>In the past, if Qiu Xier had said such words, Gao Cang would have reprimanded her immediately. He revered the master the most and couldn’t stand anyone speaking ill of him.</p>
<p>However, this time, even Gao Cang remained silent. The boy in his teens clenched the wooden bucket in his hand tightly and finally squatted down, crying bitterly.</p>
<p>But Ranran said, “If we can’t learn our skills well, we deserve punishment. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>When the group reached the pond, they found that due to last night’s rain, the previously half-filled pond was now almost overflowing. With just the four of them, it would take ages to empty the pond.</p>
<p>Ranran looked at the dejected trio, without saying a word.</p>
<p>She felt a little guilty, thinking these three were being punished as well because of her. So, she started scooping water first, then carried the bucket and headed down the mountain.</p>
<p>The path down the mountain seemed to have changed significantly, perhaps due to the rain washing it away, becoming more rugged. One had to concentrate to keep their footing and move forward slowly.</p>
<p>Ranran concentrated on the path for a while before starting to walk down the mountain. However, after a while, she exclaimed in surprise and quickened her pace, rushing down the mountain to pour out the water and then coming back up.</p>
<p>At first, she walked very slowly, but as she continued, her pace quickened.</p>
<p>“Quick, fetch some water and come down with me!” Ranran exclaimed excitedly.</p>
<p>Bai Baishan and Gao Cang were discussing how to bid farewell to their master and ask for permission to leave. When they heard Ranran’s words, they looked up listlessly. “We’re already leaving anyway, why bother with fetching water?” Bai Baishan said.</p>
<p>Ranran walked over and pulled them up, saying, “Hurry up, I’ll show you something fun.”</p>
<p>Hearing her, they had no choice but to get up, fetch water, and follow Ranran down the mountain.</p>
<p>However, the mountain path was not only wet and slippery but also more difficult to traverse, with no remarkable features. Gao Cang and the others couldn’t understand why their little junior sister was so excited.</p>
<p>At this moment, Ranran spoke up, “Haven’t you noticed that the twists and turns of this mountain path are exactly the same as the qi circulation method Shifu taught us today?”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Bai Baishan focused on the path and tried a few more steps, looking delighted. “You’re right, little junior sister. We didn’t notice until you pointed it out! But how did the path change like this? Wasn’t it due to the rain erosion?”</p>
<p>Ranran shook her head. Looking at these paths now, it seemed like they were formed by a surge of vitality qi, not naturally formed at all.</p>
<p>If these rugged mountain paths were drawn by Su Yishui’s vitality qi, he definitely wouldn’t exert so much effort just to make things difficult for his foolish disciples.</p>
<p>She thought for a moment and said, “As you carry water, try circulating qi according to the direction of the mountain path and see if you can comprehend the main points.”</p>
<p>This time, they all put their hearts into it. While carrying water, they didn’t walk lightly as usual. Instead, they tried to maintain stability on steep slopes and slow down on uphill stretches to prevent the water from spilling out of the buckets. So, once they followed the route to circulate their qi, it became clear where to condense qi and where to speed up and turn.</p>
<p>After making dozens of trips back and forth, the stagnant qi that had been difficult to move forward suddenly broke through many obstacles. Gao Cang and Bai Baishan’s heads began to emit steam. Qiu Xier also had an epiphany, feeling that carrying water became lighter and not as heavy as before.</p>
<p>However, Ranran tried a few times and still felt her vitality being blocked. She knew that the aftereffects she experienced in the Netherworld realm had not dissipated, so she didn’t rush to circulate qi and instead used light body technique to swiftly carry water.</p>
<p>After understanding Shifu’s intentions, Gao Cang and the others became very spirited and stopped mentioning returning home.</p>
<p>After spending three days emptying the pond, Gao Cang and the others felt that their qi circulation is now abundant, and had greatly surpassed their two years of cultivation in the past.</p>
<p>The disciples’ comprehension levels varied, so naturally, the teaching methods had to be different. Su Yishui had evidently taught these foolish disciples through a more direct and intuitive method.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran realized that she had misunderstood Shifu. She really shouldn’t have argued with him earlier.</p>
<p>Since she was wrong, apologizing was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>So, after emptying the pond, Ranran disregarded her sore arms and legs, and went back to the kitchen. She kneaded dough, made fillings, steamed the bean cakes that Shifu loved, and personally delivered them to his study.</p>
<p>Usually, at this time, Shifu would be reading. As expected, when she entered the study, Shifu was sitting on the incense mat, frowning as he read the few remaining books in the study.</p>
<p>Hmm, looking at the now empty study, Ranran felt that she had taken too many books with her when she left.</p>
<p>When she followed Su Yishui back, she didn’t bring any books back with her, so the book Shifu was reading now… is that deadly “Playing Classics”…</p>
<p>Seeing Su Yishui’s handsome brows become increasingly furrowed, Ranran decided to give the bean cakes to the senior brothers to eat instead.</p>
<p>As she was about to quietly back out, Su Yishui spoke, “Since you’re here, why not come in?”</p>
<p>So Ranran had no choice but to awkwardly smile and carry the tray in.</p>
<p>She deliberately avoided looking at the open “Playing Classics” and instead picked up the bean cakes, saying to Su Yishui, “These are red bean cakes I made myself with honey filling. They taste best eaten hot.”</p>
<p>Su Yishui didn’t say anything but looked at the steaming cakes. They were ordinary bean cakes, but Ranran had shaped them into little red rabbits with peach-shaped mouths, looking really cute, but no matter how you looked at it, they seemed like things for amusing children.</p>
<p>Su Yishui found it childish and didn’t want to eat them. He just lowered his eyes and said, “If there’s nothing else, you can leave.”</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t leave because she had come with the intention to apologize to Su Yishui. So, although it was difficult to speak up, she still said, “Shifu, I was wrong…”</p>
<p>Su Yishui raised an eyebrow, looking at the girl with blushing cheeks as red as peaches, and sneered, “You can make mistakes? Throughout the entire cultivation world, there’s no other disciple like you who dares to lecture the master, better don’t overwhelm me with your apology!”</p>
<p>If it were any other girl, hearing such mocking words would have made her cry and run away long ago.</p>
<p>But Ranran picked up a rabbit-shaped bean cake and solicitously placed it by Su Yishui’s lips, saying, “Shifu, take a bite of this rabbit’s butt. I added a special filling inside!”</p>
<p>Su Yishui, still with plenty of mocking words left to say, his mouth blocked by the rabbit’s butt, and the fragrance of the cake filled his nostrils. His mouth involuntarily took a bite.</p>
<p>Hmm… Inside was a diluted bean paste with honey, sweet but not cloying, quickly spreading and diffusing on his taste buds.</p>
<p>Ranran smiled and asked, “Isn’t it delicious? When I tried making it last time, I ate three of them at one go!”</p>
<p>After eating the sweet treat with honey filling, Su Yishui couldn’t help but put the rest of the rabbit-shaped cake held in Ranran’s hand into his mouth.</p>
<p>After finishing it, his brain seemed to be wrapped in the sweetness of honey, causing him to exert himself to recall what words he had prepared to scold this girl with.</p>
<p>“Are you sincerely apologizing or intentionally using food to shut people up?” Su Yi Shui couldn’t help but eat another peach-shaped bean cake, then asked with a stern face.</p>
<p>Ranran was pouring hot tea for him to cleanse his palate and replied with a half-raised head, “Naturally, I want to apologize and also make sure you eat well!”</p>
<p>After that, she quickly put away the “Playing Classics” she had written in her past life smoothly back on the nearby bookshelf. Then she sincerely said, “I shouldn’t have misunderstood your good intentions in teaching disciples. The foundation of senior brother and the others is indeed much weaker compared to the new disciples, so they can’t study advanced techniques with them. So, Shifu, when you had them do rough chores like chopping wood, it’s actually to temper them, to help them lay a solid foundation…”</p>
<p>But Su Yishui laughed coldly after hearing Ranran’s words. “You didn’t misunderstand. I did indeed make things difficult for them before, hoping they would have some insight and leave on their own.”</p>
<p>This… hearing Su Yishui’s candid admission, Ranran suddenly found it difficult to continue flattering him.</p>
<p>After a brief silence, she asked in a small voice, “But Shifu, why did you change your mind?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui stretched out his long arm, took down the “Playing Classics” again, flipped to the section about Ferocious beasts, and tapped on the pages, saying, “These annotations were written by you? I’m really curious, am I really as good as you say?”</p>
<p>Hmm, when she later corrected the mistakes, she did write quite a few good praises about Shifu. Like dotes on his disciples, being stern but soft-hearted, and being the best Shifu in the world, and so on.</p>
<p>Su Yishui leaned close and whispered softly in Ranran’s ear, “I’ve been thinking, I was probably tolerating you useless people around me for a reason. Before I remember it, you lot better become more useful, or else it’s a waste of food…”</p>
<p>Ranran’s mouth was half-open, especially regretting her actions of correcting the mistakes in the “Playing Classics” in the past.</p>
<p>It turned out that her previous self from her past life had looked foolish but was actually truly wise, completely seeing through Shifu’s hypocritical facade. This is no ferocious beast, he was practically a venom-spewing serpent with big fangs!</p>
<p>She looked at him with pursed lips, feeling increasingly dizzy from anger. So she picked up the remaining bean cakes and was about to leave.</p>
<p>But Su Yi Shui grabbed her hand before she could leave. “You brought it here and now you want to take it away? Are you a three-year-old child?”</p>
<p>Before he could finish speaking, his brows furrowed because his fingers happened to touch her pulse, and he suddenly noticed that her pulse was unstable, even worse than before?</p>
<p>Su Yishui asked urgently, “What’s going on? Did you take a wrong path in your qi circulation practice?”</p>
<p>Since he had discovered it, Ranran shook her head, feeling even more dizzy. As Su Yi Shui was holding her hand, her body went limp, and she fainted in his arms.</p>
<p>When her fragrant and soft body fell into Su Yishui’s arms, his body stiffened slightly, and he intuitively felt his empty heart suddenly filled up.</p>
<p>But he didn’t have time to think about it. He quickly sat her up and then placed his hand on her back to circulate vitality qi for her.</p>
<p>As his vitality qi circulated into her body, Ranran felt a familiar warmth spreading. She instinctively started circulating qi according to the mantra her master had taught her, as if a long-lost spring was flowing again, and the blockages were noticeably relieved.</p>
<p>However, Su Yi Shui’s brows were still furrowed because he found that the blockages in Ranran’s body were located at the major life gates of the Shen Ting and Cheng Guang. These blockages weren’t formed overnight but were due to innate deficiencies. It was just that someone had been guiding her qi circulation before, which was how she seemed no different from ordinary people.</p>
<p>Just now, when he activated his qi, this girl actually started circulating qi on her own, like a hungry little bird eagerly absorbing his qi.</p>
<p>He felt the qi in his dantian sink, and if he hadn’t quickly pulled back, she might have absorbed it all…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After forgetting parts of his memory, Su Yi Shui had always been puzzled by one thing — even though he had handed over half of his golden core, twenty years of cultivation should have been enough to compensate. So why was his current cultivation still insufficient to form a nascent soul? There also seemed to be subtle signs of internal energy depletion.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until just now, when he transferred qi to Ranran, that he finally realized that he must have been constantly transferring qi to this female disciple to prolong her life. That’s why his cultivation had stagnated and couldn’t progress further to reach the next stage. And all his hard-earned cultivation during these recent days was instantly drained in a moment by this damned girl!</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Su Yi Shui’s face turned extremely grim. He grabbed Ranran’s shoulders and emphasized each word, “What curse did you put on me? I actually sacrificed my vitality qi to nourish you this way?”</p>
<p>Ranran, who had just regained consciousness, blinked her eyes and was stunned when she understood Su Yi Shui’s words. Just now, when Shifu had transferred vitality qi to her, it was a cultivation practice they had done often in the past.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, when Shifu guided her in qi cultivation, he would also transfer vitality qi to her. So Ranran had already gotten used to it, thinking it was a necessary process for master and disciple in cultivation.</p>
<p>But Su Yi Shui had gritted his teeth and said that she was using the demonic cultivation’s dark arts to absorb qi… Ranran was gaping with surprise and speechless for a long while…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>In other words, her recent bouts of dizziness was not because of a reversal of yin and yang, but because Su Yi Shui, after returning from the Netherworld realm, completely forgot to replenish her in time, causing her to collapse.</p>
<p>Although Ranran had inwardly decided to strictly adhere to etiquette with Shifu, and try to forget the memory of their period of inappropriate intimacy. But now she suddenly realized that Shifu had been silently using the cultivation that was precious to all cultivators, just to keep her alive. Ranran suddenly felt an onset of tears as her eyes reddened.</p>
<p>So what if everyone said that he owed her? She knew he had always done his best to compensate, even sacrificing his own foundation building cultivation to prolong her life! That was enough!</p>
<p>Perhaps due to her innate frailty, Ranran had never experienced strong emotions from childhood to adulthood. But her emotions were always stirred by the glaring man before her…</p>
<p>He had completely forgotten everything, but why did she feel indebted to him with her entire being, and unable to repay him back no matter what?</p>
<p>Feeling choked up, Ranran felt extremely distressed. She didn’t care about etiquette anymore and suddenly hugged the man’s waist, throwing herself into his arms and burst into tears.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Su Yi Shui had been waiting to see how this little demoness would defend herself, and explain how she had once bewitched him and absorbed his cultivation.</p>
<p>But unexpectedly, the little demoness didn’t say a word, just threw herself into his arms, crying loudly. Those who didn’t know better, might think he had taken advantage of her!</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui was extremely furious. He reached out, thinking to push her away with force, but the sobbing and limp little demoness in his arms made him feel at a loss.</p>
<p>He couldn’t push her away, and hollering at her didn’t make her leave. He could only let her wet tears soak the front of his clothes.</p>
<p>Watching her shoulders shake uncontrollably as she cried, Su Yi Shui’s countenance changed several times. Finally, he sighed helplessly and asked, “What are you crying for? Is it because you haven’t absorbed enough qi?”</p>
<p>Ranran finally raised her head, sniffed hard, and tried to calm down. She said, “Shifu, you should take back your golden core, and don’t transfer vitality qi to me again in future. There’s a natural order to the world. I shouldn’t have been reincarnated like this. Rather than always burdening you, it’s better to let me fend for myself.”</p>
<p>As a cultivator, the greatest pain should be the stagnation of cultivation, watching hope for immortality fade, and gradually aging and dying.</p>
<p>Even though Su Yi Shui was a rare genius, using vitality qi to nourish another was not a long-term solution. If it weren’t for his earlier scheming against Wei Jiu, he might have already exhausted his qi and been unable to keep up.</p>
<p>But he had never told her these things before. Ranran would never have let Su Yi Shui do this if she had known earlier.</p>
<p>Hearing the girl’s decided words, Su Yishui raised an eyebrow and said, “Aren’t you afraid of death?”</p>
<p>Ranran shook her head and said in a low voice, “I hope you can live well…”</p>
<p>Seeing the determination in her slightly red eyes, Su Yi Shui suddenly felt his heart tighten, the pain making it hard for him to draw breath…</p>
<p>He didn’t know what was wrong with him. Just the thought that Ranran might die filled him with inexplicable panic, as if he had seen her die before…</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui calmed his mind. As if driven by a mysterious force, he reached out to wipe away her tears with his hands, saying gruffly, “Until I remember why I saved you like this, you better stay alive! What I’ve given, you can’t just return as you like!”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran looked at Su Yi Shui’s seemingly heartless expression but felt her heart overflowing with warmth. She couldn’t help but embrace this threatening ferocious beast again, sniffing greedily at his familiar scent in his arms.</p>
<p>For a moment, she couldn’t remember when was the last time she hugged him like this.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui didn’t push her away. He lowered his gaze thoughtfully and coldly asked, “Did you always hug me like this before?”</p>
<p>This little girl was quite beautiful. Could it be that she had seduced him like this before, which made him pay special attention to her?</p>
<p>Ranran knew she had forgot herself. Although she was very reluctant, she slowly let go of him, sat up, brushed the stray hair from her forehead, and muttered, “Shifu, you… are just like my father… When I miss my father, I occasionally can’t help but hug you…”</p>
<p>This explanation seemed the most reasonable. Ranran didn’t want the current Su Yishui to have any misunderstandings.</p>
<p>She reminded herself not to lose control like this again in the future, so she didn’t notice that her fatherly Shifu’s face had turned even darker.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui never expected her to come up with such things. He looked at himself in the mirror and saw his appearance as a nineteen-year-old youth. How could he look like this little demoness’s father?</p>
<p>He couldn’t help but say coldly, “Next time you miss your father, go back to visit him! Don’t call every man you see as your father. If there’s nothing else, you can leave!”</p>
<p>Ranran sniffed and got up quickly. “Shifu, do you… feel alright now? Do you feel uncomfortable?”</p>
<p>Perhaps it had been a long time since she had absorbed Shifu’s qi, and she seemed to have unconsciously absorbed a lot just now. She didn’t know if it would affect Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>But Su Yishui was annoyed. He just repeated coldly, “Leave!”</p>
<p>Ranran had no choice but to slowly walk out.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When the young girl disappeared from view, Su Yi Shui realized belatedly that once again he had been too lenient and had let this little demoness off too easily.</p>
<p>After all, he had slowly given her more than half of his cultivation and vitality qi.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui had never thought that there was anything too important in the memories sealed by the Soul-Cleansing Talisman.</p>
<p>But now he was increasingly curious about why he accomodated Xue Ranran so much and why he was willing to risk his life to save the Mu Qingge sisters.</p>
<p>If he wanted to find out everything, he had to find Elder Jiu to remove the Soul-Cleansing Talisman.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran had always thought that Su Yi Shui had taken in so many disciples recently simply because he was dissatisfied with how weak his previous disciples were.</p>
<p>But later, she discovered that these new disciples all had astonishing backgrounds. For example, Shen Kuo, whose grandfather was the former Sect Master of Crimson Gate, Shen Wen.</p>
<p>Although Shen Wen was a demonic cultivator, back then he was also a respected great figure of his generation. Unfortunately, he mistakenly took in Wei Jiu, the ungrateful one, as his disciple.</p>
<p>Everyone knew that Wei Jiu, in his eagerness for quick success, had killed his own master, Shen Wen. Shen Kuo and Wei Jiu were sworn enemies.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui took in Shen Kuo with obvious intentions — to gather forces and deal with Wei Jiu first.</p>
<p>As for Yue Sheng, he was a descendant of the Yu Mountain Sect, which used to rival the three major sects. The rise of the Jiuhua Sect and its leadership with the other two major sects to suppress Yu Mountain were events that few people now remembered.</p>
<p>But as a descendant of Yu Mountain, Yue Sheng was determined to revive his sect. Following Su Yi Shui, who was at odds with the three major sects, was a natural choice.</p>
<p>Although Yue Sheng was young, Yu Mountain Sect still had many connections, and he had gathered a lot of information about recent activities in Crimson Gate.</p>
<p>For example, there were many unfamiliar disciples entering Crimson Gate recently. They wore Crimson gate disciples’ clothes, but the other members didn’t recognize them.</p>
<p>Moreover, Wei Jiu had allocated a secluded dojo in Crimson Gate’s Red Flame Mountain to them.</p>
<p>So Su Yi Shui planned to lead his people to investigate and find out what was going on.</p>
<p>With so many talents in West Mountain now, Gao Cang and the others originally thought their Shifu wouldn’t take them along again.</p>
<p>But unexpectedly, their master brought along several senior disciples, including the slightly weaker Bai Baishan.</p>
<p>Among the newly selected disciples, Su Yi Shui only chose Shen Kuo and Yue Sheng, the top ones.</p>
<p>But this time, they didn’t travel by carriage but rode on the wind.</p>
<p>Yue Sheng still looked down on Gao Cang and the others, but his manner have become much more polite.</p>
<p>It was because when they hadn’t left the West Mountain, Yue Sheng had provoked Gao Cang and Bai Baishan several times, which Su Yi Shui had seen.</p>
<p>Su Yishui didn’t say anything, he just let Yue Sheng have a contest with Gao Cang, to step on eggshells. The loser would have to write the rules of the West Mountain Sect a hundred times.</p>

<p>I really hope this scene makes it into the drama!</p>
<p>Just imagining a furious and maniacal Su Yi Shui not being able to sleep, going out into the stormy night to carve out the mountain path, in his grand petty scheme to show Ranran he can dish out punishment justly, just to get back at her just makes me lol so much</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">淬金之火 THE TEMPERING FLAME</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>“Stepping on eggshells” is an introductory skill in cultivation’s light body technique. It involves laying cracked eggshells on the ground and then leaping and jumping on them. The one who breaks the most eggshells or breaks them first loses.</p>
<p>For someone like Yue Sheng, who has a foundation in cultivation, this skill is really nothing. Yue Sheng instinctively felt that the master was favoring him by indirectly punishing Gao Cang, that silly guy, so he readily agreed.</p>
<p>However, when they arrived at the martial arts arena, Yue Sheng was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>It turned out that those eggshells were floating in two large pots set up, and the pots were filled with boiling hot water.</p>
<p>If one’s light body technique is weak, the eggshells won’t break underfoot, but the person might get almost cooked.</p>
<p>When Su Yi Shui ordered them to step on the eggshells, Gao Cang widened his eyes, took a deep breath, and silently used the light body technique to leap into the pot.</p>
<p>However, Yue Sheng hesitated for a long time and refused to jump in. He finally said, “I’ll just admit defeat in this round and go copy the sect rules as punishment.”</p>
<p>Before he could finish speaking, Gao Cang, on the other side, already lost his strength and fell into the pot with a splash. Just when everyone thought he would be screaming in pain from being scalded, Gao Cang looked pleasantly surprised and said, “Hey, why is this water only steaming but not scalding?”</p>
<p>Later, they found out that the water boiling in the two pots was the extreme yin water from the Ice Lotus Pond. Although it looked boiling hot, it was actually just warm.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui then coldly said, “You always question why Gao Cang can be your senior disciple, right? He listens to the master without any doubt. Even with higher cultivation, you can’t match his obedience.”</p>
<p>In truth, Su Yi Shui didn’t expect that big fool Gao Cang would just jump in without any hesitation at all. It seemed that what Xue Ranran said about her senior disciples wasn’t exaggerated. Although their foundations were lacking, they were all naturally kind-hearted and loyal.</p>
<p>So, these few seemingly useless disciples finally showing some promise.</p>
<p>Yue Sheng knew he had shown weakness in this test, and his face, usually fair, turned slightly red with shame. He quietly went to copy the sect rules as punishment.</p>
<p>With this lesson serving as a warning, the conflicts between the new and old disciples came to an end, and everyone could practice peacefully together.</p>
<p>As for the mistake in the kitchen, given how “enthusiastic” the new disciples were, they were assigned all the cooking duties.</p>
<p>Anyway, Su Yi Shui had entered the stage of fasting and secluded cultivation again, cutting off contact with the outside world. So Ranran also had some free time now to focus on meditation with everyone else.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>This time they went out, Su Yi Shui took all four of the senior disciples. Yue Sheng could come along was probably due to the connections from Yu Mountain. So, he also wanted to perform well and redeem himself from past shame.</p>
<p>However, as they descended the mountain, Xue Ranran noticed that the passing passers-by looked nervous, carrying machetes and similar weapons.</p>
<p>It was said that there had been many incidents of monsters harming people in the nearby mountains recently, so the passersby were always in groups of three to five and reluctant to travel alone, carrying handy defensive tools.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran thought of those ghost-headed spiders, realizing that many monsters had escaped from the netherworld this time.</p>
<p>After they had been traveling for a while, they started to see disciples from the three major sects. They all looked like they were in a hurry, heading in the same direction as Xishan’s disciples.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran whispered to Su Yi Shui, “Are all these righteous disciples mobilized to hunt us?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui shook his head. “They should also be going to the Red Flame Mountain. There’s something they want there too.”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran remembered a passage she had read in the Fantian’s records. She suddenly realized, “Now that monsters are rampant, the righteous disciples must want to suppress them quickly. Could it be that they want to find the Tempering Flame at the Red Flame Mountain?”</p>
<p>Back then, the powerful Dun Tian slaughtered the demon king in the Red Flame Mountain, leaving behind a true fire, which was said to be a seed of fire from refining the demon king’s corpse. It had endured a hundred years without extinguishing and could cleanse demons and rectify evil.</p>
<p>However, this true fire only showed itself when there was a surge of evil spirits in the world. </p>
<p>With a large number of monsters escaping from the Netherworld gate now, it might be the time for this true fire to emerge. It was no wonder so many righteous disciples were rushing to the demonic Red Flame Mountain, a place they usually despised.</p>
<p>The Crimson Gate was adjacent to the Red Flame Mountain. This area was vast and sparsely populated. Further ahead was a barren zone, scorching hot during the day and chilling cold at night.</p>
<p>So, before entering the wasteland, they had to fill their water bags in preparation. While Xue Ranran was fetching water by a stream, she could see the fiery Red Flame Mountain ahead.</p>
<p>It was said that before the powerful Dun Tian ascended, he had annihilated everything on Red Flame Mountain, which was once a demon’s lair. Because he had refined the demon king who killed his wife and children, the Red Flame Mountain spewed lava all year round, and the temperature around the mountain was exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>For some demonic cultivators, such temperatures were beneficial for cultivating their true qi, making it an ideal place for cultivation. That’s why the Crimson Gate, belonging to the Fire Element, had thrived here for centuries.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>However, it wasn’t friendly to Ranran, who had a Yin wood elemental attribute. So, as soon as she reached the spring, she eagerly took off her shoes and socks, putting her feet into the water.</p>
<p>As the cool water rushed up, Ranran felt refreshed, just like a thirsty little tree that had found water again.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? Feeling uncomfortable again?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui’s voice suddenly came from behind her. Ranran turned around and saw Su Yishui standing behind her.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui frowned slightly at his female disciple impulsively taking off her shoes and socks.</p>
<p>Her feet were too fair, with toenails that weren’t stained with Stellaria juice but still displayed a charming light pink color. A pretty girl’s slender feet were enough to attract attention.</p>
<p>At least, those male disciples fetching water upstream seemed to be intentionally or unintentionally looking this way.</p>
<p>For the first time, Su Yi Shui felt that he had taken in too many male disciples. So, when he stood beside Ranran, his tall body naturally blocked the somewhat impudent gazes of his disciples.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t notice her master’s private thoughts. She was still pondering some things she couldn’t figure out, asking, “Shifu, do you think the true fire left by the powerful Dun Tian can really rid the world of evil spirits?”</p>
<p>However, Su Yi Shui didn’t care much about these important worldly matters. He crouched down and felt her pulse.</p>
<p>For some unknown reason, Ranran needed more and more qi to replenish herself lately. Even if Su Yi Shui wanted to keep her around for now, he was worried that he couldn’t supply enough qi just by himself.</p>
<p>Moreover, Ranran was already on guard whenever she sensed Su Yi Shui about to replenish her qi. “Shifu, if you’re going to break into the Crimson Gate to save Elder Jiu, you must maintain your best condition. I’m fine, there’s no discomfort, so please don’t replenish my qi anymore!”</p>
<p>Ranran was afraid that Su Yi Shui would deplete his true qi at this critical juncture. This place wasn’t at West Mountain; if he depleted his true qi, there wouldn’t be enough time to sit and replenish it. So, she couldn’t let Su Yi Shui deplete himself, lest he couldn’t save himself in a crisis.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui looked at her, feeling that his heart was being clutched again, even feeling an impulse to pull her into his arms.</p>
<p>In his opinion, he wasn’t under the spell of any soul-cleansing talisman. It was clearly this little demoness who had placed a spell on him.</p>
<p>This made him increasingly eager to retrieve forgotten memories and figure out what was going on with himself.</p>
<p>Why was it that lately, he always stared blankly at this young girl’s face, sometimes feeling a strange impulse when looking at her tender lips?</p>
<p>Even when he had nearly gotten engaged to Wen Hongshan before, he had always adhered to etiquette with her and never had such thoughts at all?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>It was these wandering thoughts that made him absent-mindedly listen to Ranran’s words. Suddenly, he asked, “Do you have someone you like?”</p>
<p>If he remembered correctly, he heard her mother Qiao Lian mention about arranging a marriage for her, and even arranged a few young suitors for her in the past.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t expect Su Yi Shui to suddenly change the topic like this and couldn’t help but pause for a moment with a “Ah?” Su Yi Shui continued calmly, “Just as your mother said, you’re not young anymore. If you don’t have any, among the disciples in the same sect, do you have anyone you fancy?”</p>
<p>She paused, was just about to say no, before she stopped. What was going on with her Shifu? Did he want to arrange a marriage on behalf of her parents, from within their sect?</p>
<p>While there were many handsome seniors and juniors in the sect, Ranran felt it was best to just look and not have any other entanglements with them. So, when Su Yi Shui asked, she straightforwardly said, “…There is one, but he’s not a fellow disciple. Please, Shifu, don’t ask any further.”</p>
<p>But as soon as she said this, Su Yi Shui’s expression instantly turned sour, and he coldly said, “Who is it? Tell me, I’ll check on him for you.”</p>
<p>Ranran lowered her head, absentmindedly toyed with the water with her fair feet and slowly said, “He’s just a person with a difficult personality… seems mature in appearance but actually quite childish … very petty and holds grudges, but he’s very good to me…”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui grew more and more annoyed as he listened, coldly saying, “You actually like such a person with no redeeming qualities? You can’t find a decent man?”</p>
<p>Ranran burst into laughter and looked up at him, smiling brightly. “Yes, maybe he is not any good in the eyes of others, but in my heart, he’s the best. I don’t want anyone else!”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui stood up abruptly. He had wasted enough time with this silly girl. He didn’t want to listen to her nonsense anymore.</p>
<p>What kind of decent man could a fool like her be interested in, who could be swayed with a few sweet words? He was just bored and actually asked her such a stupid question!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The journey ahead was extremely oppressive and heavy for the disciples of Xishan. Su Yi Shui’s face was as dark as ink, making everyone afraid to approach.</p>
<p>But no one could figure out what had upset Shifu so much. Qiu Xier asked Ranran, who also said she didn’t know.</p>
<p>Because Su Yi Shui seemed unwilling to talk to her, and after being given the cold shoulder several times, Ranran stopped trying to engage him. Besides, with two uncle masters serving Su Yi Shui, she didn’t need to approach.</p>
<p>During the journey, she chatted with her seniors and juniors to pass the time, deliberately distracting herself from sadness due to Su Yi Shui’s cold treatment. Ranran was never one to dwell in sorrow for too long.</p>
<p>However, every time she was amused by Yue Sheng and Bai Baishan’s antics and laughed out loud, she inadvertently turned her head and saw the sharp gaze Su Yi Shui cast her way…</p>
<p>Well, when Shifu was in a bad mood, disciples really shouldn’t be laughing too loudly.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But as they continued forward, no one could laugh anymore. Yue Sheng accidentally stepped on the ground ahead and let out a cry of pain. It turned out that the ground in this desert, which they had to pass through, had inexplicably become scorching hot.</p>
<p>Shen Kuo crouched down, thinking aloud, “This is a sign of spiritual energy gathering. Places with concentrated heat often have nascent soul cultivators… Could Wei Jiu be preparing to ascend?”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Yue Sheng showed some urgency on his face. Wei Jiu was the most notorious demon after Mu Qingge. If he could subdue him, he would surely gain fame. Whether Yu Mountain could regain its former glory depended on Yue Sheng alone, so he naturally didn’t want Wei Jiu to ascend after forming his nascent soul.</p>
<p>But Su Yi Shui coldly said, “His core formation is damaged; how could he form his nascent soul so quickly? This level of heat… is probably related to the Tempering Flame…”</p>
<p>However, it was best that they inquired about what had happened here from the locals. Near the Red Flame Mountain was a town called Red Flame Town. The town was desolate, with only one dilapidated inn.</p>
<p>As they approached, before Yue Sheng who was in the front could speak, an old man with a white beard who was making grass shoes at the door spoke first, “Are you all here to court death? If you have no business, leave quickly; otherwise, you won’t be able to leave…”</p>
<p>Qiu Xier cautiously asked the old man, “Why? Is it very dangerous here?”</p>
<p>The old man half-lifted his head and said coldly, “You’re not the first batch of people who came here to die. You probably won’t listen to advice either. My inn only has one room left; do you want it?”</p>
<p>Now that the ground outside was scorching hot, if they couldn’t ascend Red Flame Mountain today, they indeed needed a place to rest. However, both the inn and the old man seemed inexplicably strange, making them hesitant to move forward.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Just then, several people walked out of the inn. Leading them was Wealth God Wang Suizhi, and beside him were Qin Xuanjiu and others, with Mu Ranwu who was using her older sister’s name, among them.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu seemed much more energetic compared to the last time they have met, with much more vitality. However, although she had taken in so many orphan disciples, there weren’t many with her at the moment.</p>
<p>Seeing Su Yi Shui and the others, Mu Ranwu paused slightly, then smiled again, “Why have all the disciples from Xishan come as well?”</p>
<p>She saw Su Yi Shui leading people and wasn’t afraid.</p>
<p>Because she knew that he would act out of consideration for her sister. Even if he knew she was impersonating her, he wouldn’t harm her. After all, he had promised her sister to take care of her.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui felt guilty towards her sister, so no matter what excessive things she did, Su Yi Shui wouldn’t really hold it against her…</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Mu Ranwu naturally greeted Su Yi Shui without fear.</p>
<p>But when Xue Ranran saw Mu Ranwu, she felt more complicated feelings in her heart. Although this woman who deceived and swindled might have been her younger sister in a past life, Ranran couldn’t feel any sisterly affection for her now.</p>
<p>Seeing Wang Suizhi and Qin Xuanjiu and other disciples from her past life, being gathered around her, and recalling how Qin Xuanjiu had once cried bitterly because of his master’s neglect, Ranran was really worried about these disciples.</p>
<p>Given Mu Ranwu’s nature, she might be planning to use these disciples to do something.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Xue Ranran coldly asked, “I wonder what Elder Mu is doing here?”</p>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu eagerly replied, “Recently, many demons have appeared everywhere, harming the common people. My Master is upholding justice, chasing demons along the way, and has come here. What about you all coming here?”</p>
<p>When Ranran heard about demons, her mind raced. “What kind of demons? Is it the Ghost-headed Spider?”</p>
<p>Qin Xuanjiu said, “Not just this kind; they are all netherworld demons. You, your master, and Wei Jiu once went into the Netherworld, secretly opened a rift, and released these demons! My Master had to clean up after you! From what I see, are you and Wei Jiu in cahoots? Is this intentional, to take advantage of chaos and expand Xishan’s power?”</p>
<p>Recently, Xishan had been recruiting and had gained many new disciples, at the peak of popularity and making people wary.</p>
<p>Gao Cang immediately glared, “Nonsense! Our Shifu went to the Netherworld to return the Spirit Spring. If the Spirit Spring had remained in the human realm, it would have caused great calamity!”</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu smiled and said, “Alright, Xuanjiu, don’t blame your senior brother. When he entered the Netherworld before, if he was unintentionally manipulated by Wei Jiu, it was also due to circumstances. I believe he didn’t deliberately release those demons…”</p>
<p>She timed her words just right. Old Feng from the YiRen Hall brought a group of people out at this moment, and his Yin and Yang eyes were assessing the disciples of Xishan.</p>
<p>In addition, the top disciples of the three major sects also appeared one after another. No wonder the old man at the inn said they were fully booked; this small, run-down inn is housing many hidden talents from all over!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>It turned out that during this time, incidents of demons harming people had occurred everywhere, and the Ghost-headed Spiders encountered by Xue Ranran was just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>Even the capital, with strong Yang energy, had experienced anomalies. Every night, large bats would come out to suck blood.</p>
<p>These chaotic phenomena of demons running rampant were even worse than when the demon’s son had secretly took the Spirit Spring out of the Netherworld.</p>
<p>Now that demons were multiplying, they would eventually become an uncontrollable disaster. So, the three major sects were invited by the YiRen Hall in the capital to come to Red Flame Mountain to search for the Tempering Flame that could suppress demons.</p>
<p>It was because of this seed of fire that the temperature and terrain around Red Flame Mountain were so different, with the ground beneath their feet being baked red.</p>
<p>However, no one knew exactly where this seed of fire was in Red Flame Mountain, not even its owner Wei Jiu.</p>
<p>So, everyone gathered here to force Wei Jiu to open the mountain gate and let them go find the true fire to drive away demons.</p>
<p>But they didn’t expect that Su Yi Shui, the former demon son, would also bring his disciples here. Thinking that all these anomalies seemed to be related to Su Yi Shui taking the Spirit Spring out back then, everyone’s anger vented towards the disciples of Xishan.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Mu Ranwu’s words were clearly provocative, deliberately inciting the anger of the crowd.</p>
<p>But just as she finished speaking, Mu Ranwu noticed that something was off with Su Yi Shui’s gaze, not the usual indifference but carrying a strong killing intent.</p>
<p>Before Mu Ranwu could react, Su Yi Shui had already attacked.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu hurriedly raised her hand to activate her spirit shield to block, but Su Yi Shui’s hand was like a blade, directly breaking through the spirit shield and fiercely gripping Mu Ranwu’s neck.</p>
<p>Seeing him attack, Qin Xuanjiu rushed forward with his blade, but how could he be a match for Su Yi Shui?</p>
<p>But just then, two expressionless men suddenly appeared behind Mu Ranwu.</p>
<p>Their faces seemed sealed, their eyes not blinking at all, their hands turning Qi into blades as they attacked Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>Their attacks were fierce and brutal, wrapped in a chilling killing intent.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui naturally dodged, letting go and stepping back a few steps. Then, he narrowed his eyes he assessed the two strange men.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu had been using Wei Jiu’s methods during this time, absorbing the spiritual power of Yin children. She had thought that she had recovered enough. But she didn’t expect Su Yi Shui’s moves to be even more ruthless, leaving her no room to maneuver and putting her in a life-threatening situation.</p>
<p>Although she had finally managed to break free from the steel clamp-like grip of the big hand, with the help of her two followers behind her, her throat was already hoarse and she could hardly speak.</p>
<p>She staggered back, frustrated and angry, “You… you actually want to kill me? Have you forgotten…”</p>
<p>She wanted to say, “Have you forgotten that my sister entrusted me to you?” But now there were people around, and she still had to maintain Mu Qingge’s persona, so she could only grit her teeth and endure it.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui coldly said, “I hate it most when others accuse me falsely. What do these demons have to do with me? You’re inciting trouble, such intentions deserve death!”</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu wanted to argue with him, but her neck was too painful, and her voice was hoarse like a duck’s, so her eyes reddened with anger.</p>
<p>By the side, Xue Ranran watched, clutching her neck as if Su Yi Shui had not strangled Mu Ranwu, but her delicate neck instead.</p>
<p>See here, if it weren’t for Mu Qingge doing so much for Su Yi Shui later on and moved him, this rebellious disciple would be a ferocious beast who could kill his master without any hesitation!</p>
<p>Even though she had been preparing for the possibility of dying weakly, due to insufficient true qi, </p>
<p>In her imagined scenario, it would be best to reunite with her parents, cook for them one last time, and then lie and tell them she was about to ascend to become an immortal and perhaps never seeing them again. She would then go to the flower sea she had visited with Shifu before. With fireflies dancing around her, she could quietly close her eyes and pass.</p>
<p>The thought of dying in Su Yi Shui’s eyes full of hatred, this kind of death is not too wonderful.</p>
<p>Ranran made up her mind to tightly hold onto her current protective armor. She was the sister Mu Ranwu. She absolutely couldn’t let Shifu discover right now that she was the past Mu Qingge!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Just then, an elder from the Kongshan Sect came out to mediate.</p>
<p>“Alright, we haven’t figured out the cause of the rampant demons yet. Why raise such a big commotion? Su Yi Shui, didn’t you come here to stay? Just go and get a room.”</p>
<p>With this statement, she indirectly refuted Mu Ranwu’s claim that the demons were released by Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu knew that the three major sects wouldn’t be manipulated by her like fools this time. She could only grit her teeth in frustration, clutching her neck, and retreated to her room.</p>
<p>After this chaos, Su Yi Shui finally booked the last room.</p>
<p>But the room was so small that even if everyone meditated all night, there wouldn’t be enough space.</p>
<p>Ranran and Qiu Xier went downstairs to find some food and check if there were any extra blankets in the inn to lay on the floor. This way, meditating wouldn’t be too uncomfortable.</p>
<p>As night fell, everyone went back to their rooms, setting up spiritual shields to keep to themselves. However, when she went downstairs, Ranran heard voices coming from the backyard.</p>
<p>Ranran looked out through the open window and saw Wang Suizhi talking to a young boy brought in. The boy looked weak and terrified.</p>
<p>“Lord, please spare me? Its rare that Master didn’t take me for cultivation today. Please just pretend you didn’t see me! If I stay, I will surely die!”</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">入山入阵   INTO THE FORMATION</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Wang Suizhi frowned and scolded the kneeling boy in a low voice, “Since you’ve already become a disciple, how can you just leave like this? You’re betraying the sect! Besides, without parents, where do you plan to go?”</p>
<p>The boy choked up and said, “It’s because I have no parents, that you all bully me. You chose me and over a dozen other beggars to join the sect, but why did they one by one fall mysteriously ill and die, their bodies wasted away? What Master? I think she’s a blood-sucking skeleton demon!”</p>
<p>Hearing such rebellious words from the boy, Wang Suizhi was initially furious, but then he became resigned. He took out a pouch from his pocket and handed it to the boy, saying, “Since it’s come to this, I won’t force you to stay. Here’s some money for your journey, head northeast, where your luck will be better. Although you won’t become rich, it should be enough to feed yourself……”</p>
<p>The boy gratefully took the money pouch and hurriedly left like he was escaping for his life.</p>
<p>Wang Suizhi stood in the courtyard for a long while, sighing at the solitary moon. But as he turned around, he saw Xue Ranran standing in the corner. He was surprised for a moment, then politely nodded before preparing to leave.</p>
<p>Ranran couldn’t help but say, “Since you already know something is wrong with your Master, why not leave? Why assist in wrongdoing?”</p>
<p>Wang Suizhi’s face turned stern, “How dare you slander my Master?”</p>
<p>Ranran continued, “Actually, you already have the answer in your heart, but you refuse to believe it. Your Master may be great, but if she’s done wrong, blindly following her is akin to aiding wrongdoing.”</p>
<p>Wang Suizhi hesitated, “Miss Xue, what do you mean?”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran said, “When you recruited those children at the border, they were all born in the Yin month. I was puzzled at first, why pay such attention to birth months? But today, seeing the children with Elder Mu all looking weak and spent, while Elder Mu herself is radiant, I suddenly understood. She must have practiced a demonic method of extracting life force…”</p>
<p>“Stop your nonsense! How could my Master do such a thing?” Wang Suizhi was both angry and anxious, but he was more afraid to disturb others, so he lowered his voice and growled.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran took a deep breath slowly. If she hadn’t discovered Su Yi Shui helping herself with replenishing her vitality qi, she might not have thought of this.</p>
<p>Both she and Mu Ranwu were fruits fallen from the Rebirth tree. Although Mu Ranwu used reincarnation to steal her sister’s cultivation, after depleting her vitality in the palace, her lack of inner strength should have presented.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu didn’t have someone like Su Yi Shui to help her to replenish Qi, so how could she get through this crisis?</p>
<p>So tonight, after eavesdropping on Wang Suizhi and the boy, she immediately understood everything.</p>
<p>Seeing Wang Suizhi let the boy go, Ranran felt that Wang Suizhi’s nature was not evil. She didn’t want him to continue doing bad things with Mu Ranwu, so she deliberately pointed it out to him.</p>
<p>“Whether she’d done it or not, but deep down, you already have an answer, don’t you?” Ranran said softly after hearing his question.</p>
<p>Wang Suizhi was momentarily speechless, unable to come up with anything.</p>
<p>Of course, he had also noticed something wrong. The children he brought in, although they were thin from not eating enough, were all healthy before. </p>
<p>But after following the Master’s practice, the innately talented children fell ill one after the other, as if they were being drained dry. When they were dying, the Master would instruct them to be sent away, and he didn’t know if they lived or died afterward.</p>
<p>Wang Suizhi hadn’t slept well these days. Whenever he slept, he would see those children who were being sent away, looking at him with hollow eyes, and then he would wake up drenched in cold sweat.</p>
<p>But he couldn’t say these things to other disciples. </p>
<p>After all, the rebirth of their Master was a miracle everyone had longed for. If he said even half a word, it would be considered treason.</p>
<p>Now hearing Xue Ranran’s words, he actually felt enlightened. “If… I mean if it’s true, what do you think I should do?”</p>
<p>Ranran looked at the middle-aged man in front of her. Perhaps twenty years ago, when he was still a youth, he had also asked her for advice when he felt lost.</p>
<p>“If you feel something is wrong, why not leave…” </p>
<p>Wang Suizhi sighed softly, “You don’t know, my Master has brought in some people… Even if I wanted to leave, I can’t…”</p>
<p>Thinking of the two expressionless people who fought with Shifu during the day, Ranran was also curious. Who exactly were they?</p>
<p>Now that the relationship between Mu Ranwu and Su Yu was delicate, she wouldn’t be at ease having Su Yu’s people around her. If they weren’t from the Yiren Hall, could they be from the Crimson Gate?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Just then, on the other side of the inn, the sound of a child crying seemed to come through. It seems that Mu Ranwu wanted to cultivate, but found the child missing, so she sent people to search. The runaway boy hadn’t gone very far before he was caught by an expressionless attendant and brought back.</p>
<p>Wang Suizhi trembled slightly upon hearing the child’s cries, not out of fear of punishment from his master, but because he truly felt he had unintentionally done something that deserved condemnation.</p>
<p>Ranran took out a few talismans from her waist and handed them to Wang Suizhi. Then, channeling her voice only to Wang Suizhi, she conveyed, “These are invisibility talismans. If you intend to leave, please take the remaining children and General Qin with you. He’s too principled and easily manipulated. You can get him drunk, then stick the talismans on everyone and hide in the wine barrels behind the inn… These talismans can conceal your presence, and the strong scent of the wine barrels will also help to conceal you… Don’t confront Elder Mu, as she has strange people aiding her now, you won’t be a match for her…”</p>
<p>After receiving them, Wang Suizhi gritted his teeth, seemingly determined to trust this kind girl just this once. For some reason, with his years of experience in business and reading people, he just felt Xue Ranran was worthy of trust.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>At this moment, Wang Suizhi suddenly said to Xue Ranran, “Miss, if you’re asking about wealth, your fortune lies in the north. If you head there tomorrow, you’re bound to make a fortune…”</p>
<p>While they were speaking, a hoarse voice came from the other side of the courtyard, “Miss Xue has quite the asthetic mood, asking for financial opportunities from my disciple in the middle of the night? Is there something that couldn’t wait until daytime?”</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu with her hoarse voice, appeared in the courtyard with a cold smile on her face.</p>
<p>Due to her neck being injured by Su Yi Shui, Mu Ranwu hadn’t meditated in time today. After a tired sleep, she woke up and couldn’t find the boy who had been nourishing her for several days. As she had been feeling on his qi for the past few days, she immediately sensed that he had left the inn.</p>
<p>As she prepared to go teach the runaway boy a lesson, she passed by here, and happened to overhear Wang Suizhi’s words, as if Xue Ranran was asking about financial opportunities.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu immediately came out to put a stop to it. Now, Wang Suizhi was her wealth god disciple; why should Xue Ranran be allowed to make money?</p>
<p>Moreover, when did Wang Suizhi become so close with Xue Ranran? Did Wang Suizhi realize that she was an imposter?</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu currently needed alot of money and couldn’t do without Wang Suizhi, her money source. So she couldn’t let Xue Ranran influence Wang Suizhi.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>In the past, Xue Ranran would never have confronted Elder Mu head-on. But knowing that she was deliberately impersonating her and doing shady and sinsiter things, Ranran now looked at her coldly.</p>
<p>She looked at the few pale-faced children behind Mu Qingge, thinking that these children might not last long either.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, she looked at Wang Suizhi again and told him via voice channeling “These children were recruited by you. If you have a conscience, find a way to save them. If you need help in the future, you can come to Xishan to find me… Actually have you ever wondered, is your current master really Mu Qingge?”</p>
<p>After conveying these hidden words, Xue Ranran turned to Mu Ranwu and said, “I happened to meet Master Wang here and chatted with him briefly. Elder Mu won’t mind, will you?”</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu was about to reply, but then she saw Su Yi Shui has also appeared in the courtyard. This startled her, and she took a few steps back, telling Wang Suizhi, “Hurry up and follow me!”</p>
<p>Wang Suizhi, on the other hand, seemed stunned by what Xue Ranran last said. Trying to maintain his composure, he cast an apprehensive glance at Xue Ranran, and left with Mu Ranwu.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran sighed. If she said she was Mu Qingge right now, she guessed Wang Suizhi wouldn’t believe her, and he might even think she was sent by Su Yi Shui to sow discord between him and his mentor.</p>
<p>So she could only give a slight hint and let Wang Suizhi figure out this mess by himself. However, those children really couldn’t wait any longer.</p>
<p>Anyway, they would all enter the mountains tomorrow. Even if Mu Ranwu noticed there were people missing, she wouldn’t be able to spare the energy to chase them. Hopefully, Wang Suizhi could use those talismans cleverly and escape Mu Ranwu’s control.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After Mu Ranwu and her group have completely gone.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui walked slowly in front her, looking down at her. His handsome eyes narrowed slightly as he suddenly asked, “Are you unhappy because I attacked your sister during the day?”</p>
<p><em>She had been reluctant to go back to the room, choosing to linger in the courtyard. Was she mad at him?</em></p>
<p>Ranran took a pause, then immediately remembered that he thought that she was Mu Qingge’s sister, Mu Ranwu.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, she said, “She’s not my elder sister. I don’t have a sister in this lifetime. Even if she were my real sister, if she did something wrong, she should bear the consequences herself…”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui heard this and snorted coldly, “In her past life, she doted on you the most, always protecting you in every way. You are sure disassociating so cleanly now.”</p>
<p>Although he had always disliked Mu Qingge’s pampering of her incompetent sister who acted like a baby, her sudden ruthlessness now seemed heartless and ungrateful.</p>
<p>Ranran sighed softly, “I was really wrong. Can’t I make up for the debt from my past life even by dying?”</p>
<p>Perhaps in the past life, she had pampered Mu Ranwu too much, allowing her greed to increasingly grow, ultimately leading to her desire to replace her.</p>
<p>She had made a mistake and paid with the price of death. In this lifetime, she had no sisterly affection for Mu Ranwu, nor did she want to shelter this extremely selfish and malicious woman.</p>
<p>But these words sounded different in Su Yi Shui’s ears. He felt that he was perhaps too hard on this young girl. She didn’t know anything in this lifetime. If he continued to criticize her, wouldn’t it be too harsh?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The next morning, as people in the inn were getting ready to leave, Mu Ranwu discovered that Wang Suizhi, General Qin, and the children she used to nurture her Qi were all missing.</p>
<p>Despite searching the entire inn, she couldn’t find them nor any clues. When asking the remaining people, they only said they saw Wang Suizhi drinking with General Qin last night, and after that, they knew nothing.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu’s face turned red with anger as she glared fiercely at Xue Ranran. She was now absolutely certain that her handy pawns were missing because of Xue Ranran’s mischief!</p>
<p>Xue Ranran did not avoid her gaze and just stared coldly back at her.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu felt her heart skip a beat instinctively, and her neck involuntarily shrunk: Damn it! The look in that brat’s eyes is exactly the same as when her elder sister glared at her in her past life! It made her instinctively want to shrink her neck and admit her mistakes… This feeling of being suppressed for a long time is truly maddening.</p>
<p>Compared to her perfect sister, everything she did was wrong, and she would never be as perfect as her!</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu bit her lip hard and could only temporarily set aside this matter. Once she found the Tempering Fire, it would be her time to shine in the world.</p>
<p>By that time, those traitors who left the sect, she wouldn’t let a single one of them go!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The wilderness around the Red Flame Mountain cooled down after a night, and it was only in the morning that one could walk on it comfortably.</p>
<p>Before setting off, Ranran was stopped by the old man watching the inn’s entrance. “Little girl, your shoes are torn. The road on that wilderness isn’t easy to walk on. Let me give you a pair of grass shoes.”</p>
<p>Ranran looked down and indeed saw a hole in her shoes. In this vast area with few people, it would be inconvenient to buy new shoes.</p>
<p>After thanking the old man, she took out some silver from her pocket and said, “I’ll buy a few more pairs, in case Shifu and others’ shoes got worn out too.”</p>
<p>The old man grinned, showing his yellowed teeth, “I only made two pairs. Take the other pair as well, free of charge, consider it a gift.”</p>
<p>Ranran sniffed with her small nose, paused for a moment, then smiled and said, “Thank you, old uncle.”</p>
<p>The old man lowered his head and said mildly, “I advise you all not to court your death. The road ahead is difficult…”</p>
<p>Ranran was about to say something else when the old man picked up his bamboo basket and went to the backyard to cut grass.</p>
<p>When Qiu Xier walked over and saw Ranran looking at the old man’s back, she asked, “What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>Ranran thought for a moment and said, “I seem to have seen this old man somewhere before…”</p>
<p>Qiu Xier looked as well but didn’t notice anything unusual about the old man. He was just an ordinary old man commonly seen in the mountains.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As the area around Red Flame Mountain became lively with people gathering, Crimson Gate’s Wei Jiu also received reports early in the morning.</p>
<p>He didn’t care at all about the people coming to challenge them.</p>
<p>The demonic sect Crimson Gate has been rooted here, other than the beneficial fire attributes for cultivation, the difficulty to attack this place played a significant role.</p>
<p>After ambushing Su Yi Shui at the border, he did not know how effective the Soul-Cleansing Talisman was. Later he learned from the spies he placed in the town that Zeng Yi had taken Xue Ranran and left Su Yi Shui, he knew then that the talisman had worked.</p>
<p>Since Su Yi Shui had forgotten his love for Mu Qingge, he naturally wouldn’t have any special feelings for Xue Ranran anymore.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran, toyed with and discarded by her master, must be feeling disheartened. Wei Jiu’s plan was to first watch her and go look for her when he has the time. If nothing unexpected happened, he would bring Xue Ranran back to Crimson Gate.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when he went to look for her after dealing with matters in the sect, that Xue Ranran had already returned to Xishan with Su Yi Shui. Even her parents were nowhere to be found with Zeng Yi.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu knew that Su Yi Shui was recruiting forces, and among the new disciples, there was even a descendant of his master Shen Wen.</p>
<p>And it seemed that when he found Xue Ranran, he had intended to take back his golden core. Wei Jiu thought that Xue Ranran was quite cunning and would find a way to save herself. But that was good too. After Su Yi Shui completely breaks her heart, she would understand who knows how to really care for her.</p>
<p>When he heard that they were gathering at the inn near Red Flame Mountain, Wei Jiu wasn’t too flustered. He just sneered, “They want to enter my Crimson Gate to find the Tempering Flame, they’ll have to see if I, the master, am willing!”</p>
<p>But since they are already here, it would go against the principle of hospitality if he didn’t give them a good welcome.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he ordered, “Someone, set up the Five Fiends Illusion Array and let our guests warm up a little!”</p>
<p>As for Xue Ranran, of course he would also prepare a special gift for her. Hoping that after she saw the true hypocritical nature of Su Yi Shui, she would realize the benefits of being with a truly cunning person like him…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As for the several groups of people from the inn, who arrived at the foot of Red Flame Mountain in batches, they did not encounter disciples from Crimson Gate to stop them.</p>
<p>But as they got closer to Red Flame Mountain, the temperature gradually became hotter.</p>
<p>Ranran felt her feet heating up again, so she took off her torn shoes and put on the grass shoes the old man had given her. When she put them on, they fit perfectly and seemed to have some peppermint and cool grass inside, making her feet feel cool and very comfortable.</p>
<p>She was about to ask Su Yi Shui if he wanted to change as well, when she noticed that he seemed to be staring ahead.</p>
<p>Following his gaze forward, the swirling sands in the desert scattered, revealing five huge eggs resembling big drums.</p>
<p>If one looked closely, the dust on these five eggs was blown away by the strong wind, revealing intricate carvings on their surfaces. The markings looked very ancient.</p>
<p>As the elders of the three major sects who were walking at the forefront saw the patterns on the eggs clearly, their faces changed drastically, one said in a low voice, “Not good! Are these giant eggs… the Five Fiends?”</p>
<p>The wilderness below the Red Flame Mountain was the battlefield where Dun Tian had fought against the Demon King years ago. It was said that the Demon King had gathered the Five Fiends’ artifacts to form a formation, intending to trap Dun Tian.</p>
<p>Later, it was Dun Tian’s wife, Rong Yao, who guided him with her voice infused with true qi, awakening Dun Tian in time to break through the formation.</p>
<p>Although the Demon King was ultimately killed, Dun Tian had achieved enlightenment when he abandoned his wife and children and ascended on the spot. Thus, this maze was preserved intact.</p>
<p>After all, it has been a long time, and even the three major sects’ discussions about the Five Fiends are vague. However, the patterns on those eggshells are recorded in the classics of various major cultivation sects.</p>
<p>These five fiends were Giant Mosquito, Golden Armor Beetle, Human-Faced Flea, Ghost Infant, and Mirage. Each fiend was a creature of evil Qi bred by the Demon King back then and sealed in stone eggs. They wouldn’t dissipate for hundreds of years.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Just as everyone was hesitant and uncertain, a melancholic and eerie flute sounded, piercing the eardrums and causing pain. The five giant eggs slowly floated up, and dense mist began to emanate from the cracks of the stone eggs, creating a formation.</p>
<p>At this moment, Elder Gao Shen from Jiuhua Sect shouted, “Excellency Wei, we are here with a request, why use such a big show of force to welcome us?”</p>
<p>A strange laughter came from the rocky caves scattered around Red Flame Mountain, “You Elders have always been hospitable to me before. Today, after much anticipation, we are honored by your esteemed presence. If I don’t make it more grand, wouldn’t it be disrespectful? Please, show your skills. Whoever can successfully pass through this Five Fiends Illusion Array, I, Wei Jiu, will offer fine wine to host you!”</p>
<p>After saying this, there was no more sound.</p>
<p>An elder from Feiyun Sect said, “The array is about to be set up, and now is when the defense of the Five Fiends is weakest. Let’s each choose a giant egg and attack simultaneously. If we can break them, we can surely break the array!”</p>
<p>After speaking, he pointed his hand, and a blazing fire shot towards one of the eggs in mid-air. Others also joined in, spells flying everywhere, with fire, water, and frost intertwining, creating a spectacular scene.</p>
<p>As people attacked the eggs, the flute melody suddenly intensified, its already unpleasant sound now resembling the desperate cry of an old crow on the brink of death.</p>
<p>The eggs continued to rise, and after reaching a certain height, they moved in unique trajectories in the air, then burst open with a bang, releasing a terrifying aura that surged towards everyone like a monstrous wave.</p>
<p>It was like a pot of fragrant soup instantly turned into black soup with the addition of pitch-black ink, the arena was filled with a sinister aura, surrounding everyone.</p>
<p>After resisting the impact of the sinister aura, they saw five huge gates of sinister energy appearing where the five eggs were. Everyone knew that to break the formation, they had to break through these gates.</p>
<p>At this point, it all depended on luck. Thinking about breaking into the formation that Dun Tian had once broken into, everyone was eager to try it, and make a name for themselves.</p>
<p>Some even took out Feng Shui compasses to sense which gate had the least sinister energy inside and entered that one. Because every formation would have a <a href="https://www.baike.com/wikiid/6793162145956455866">Life Gate</a>, if they were extremely lucky and entered it, their chances of escaping smoothly would be higher.</p>
<p>Yue Sheng’s eyes were fixed on Lao Feng from the Yiren Hall.</p>
<p>He knew that Lao Feng’s Yin-Yang Eyes were very powerful, so he decided that wherever Lao Feng went, he would follow.</p>
<p>After Lao Feng surveyed the five entrances and decided to enter the one directly to the west. Just as Yue Sheng had thought, Lao Feng’s eyes could see through the mist. The other gates were filled with dense black aura, only the one directly to the west had the least sinister energy. So Lao Feng led the people from the Yiren Hall to enter the western gate first.</p>
<p>Yue Sheng was eager to enter as well but was stopped by Ranran, “You go in with the people from the Yiren Hall. Even if there’s no sinister energy in that gate, you could be ambushed by them.”</p>
<p>After saying this, Ranran turned to Shen Kuo and asked, “You are a descendant of the former master of Crimson Gate, do you know the way to break this Five Fiends Array?”</p>
<p>Shen Kuo shook his head slowly, “Although my grandfather was a demonic cultivator, his methods were only different from those of immortal cultivators. He never acted as boldly and recklessly as Wei Jiu, nor did he dare to use ancient evil formations. But according to the ancient records of Crimson Gate, the longer you stay in the formation, the stronger the attacks of the sinister energy, so it’s best to get out quickly.”</p>
<p>After hearing Shen Kuo’s words, Yue Sheng no longer wanted to waste time and clasped his fists to Su Yi Shui, “Master, disciple is willing to scout ahead for you and take a look at the west gate.”</p>
<p>After speaking, he turned around and hurriedly leaped into the west gate. Gao Cang was so angry that he spat at his back, “He’s really young master who cherishes life. Master has yet to choose, but he’s so eager to escape on his own!”</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">熟悉小调   A FAMILIAR TUNE</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>But Mu Ranwu’s group didn’t make a choice either. Mu Ranwu looked around and then asked her disciples, “Which gate do you think is the best?”</p>
<p>What could those disciples say, they naturally followed their master’s lead. Mu Ranwu smiled and stood still, seeming not in a hurry.</p>
<p>At that moment, the other cultivators, each showing their abilities like the Eight Immortals crossing the sea, also chose their gates to enter the formation. However, people entered the west and east gates,with none going through the gate directly to the north. It was because it emitted a strong black aura, accompanied by occasional roars of monsters, which made it very ominous.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui turned to Ranran and asked, “If it were you, which one would you choose?”</p>
<p>Ranran blinked and pointed to the large gate directly to the north, “This one!”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui raised an eyebrow, “Why this one?”</p>
<p>Ranran’s answer was straightforward, “The god of wealth said that if I go north, I’ll find great wealth! It shouldn’t be wrong to listen to him.”</p>
<p>Although the god of wealth had noticed Mu Ranwu coming over at that time and deliberately raised his voice to change the topic, but he had never been wrong in indicating the path to wealth!</p>
<p>Qiu Xier shrugged helplessly, “My junior sister, if we die and was given a coffin and funeral goods, that’s also considered finding great wealth! How can we listen to a merchant’s words for such a important thing like breaking an evil array?”</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Su Yi Shui nodded after hearing this, pointing to the gate directly to the north, “This path should have fewer people and is more quiet. Let’s take this one…”</p>
<p>The remaining disciples did not expect that their master’s reason was even more rough and hasty, choosing a path simply because it was quieter and less crowded, which made their expressions crumble.</p>
<p>However, they had to follow their master’s decision. So, the remaining disciples followed Su Yi Shui into the gate directly to the north. Mu Ranwu also chose the north gate without hesitation, following behind Su Yi Shui’s group.</p>
<p>She had attendants who could stand up to Su Yi Shui, so she wasn’t afraid of him turning hostile for now.</p>
<p>Compared to the unreliable mainstream sects and the strange talents of the Yiren Hall, Mu Ranwu was more inclined to trust Su Yi Shui and her former sister’s choice.</p>
<p>So, the two groups entered the most dangerous north gate one after the other.</p>
<p>The moment they stepped in, the ground where they had been standing at the center of the formation suddenly collapsed, and flames soared up thousands of feet.</p>
<p>It seemed that Shen Kuo’s words were not false. If they had hesitated for another moment, they would have been trapped in the sea of fire.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After entering the north gate, they found themselves in a sealed barrier, not as terrifying as it seemed from the outside.</p>
<p>It seemed like a dark and damp cave here. There was a faint light ahead, but as everyone approached the light, they involuntarily took a few steps back.</p>
<p>It turned out that directly ahead was a stone-built chessboard, and sitting beside it, playing chess, was a monstrous creature that didn’t look human at all!</p>
<p>Although it had a human face, its body looked more like a giant flea, full of blood…</p>
<p>Ranran vaguely guessed that the master of this boundary they had entered should be the human-faced flea among the Five Fiends.</p>
<p>It was said that this human-faced flea was the first person to use the Seven Evil Transformation Curse. Back then, he was a close friend of Dun Tian, but he fell for Rong Yao, who would become Dun Tian’s wife.</p>
<p>Moreover, after Rong Yao chose Dun Tian, he underwent a drastic change in temperament, turned to the demonic path, and eventually, due to madness, mistakenly used the evil curse and merged with a flea. Since then, he had a half-human, half-insect appearance, became a malevolent fiend, and was used by the Demon King, merged into the Five Fiend formation.</p>
<p>This person was said to be skilled at chess and had developed feelings for Rong Yao through the game. This obsession remained unchanged even after becoming a malevolent fiend. Inside this formation, he managed to conjure up a chessboard for his own amusement.</p>
<p>“This just got interesting, but here come you annoying pests… Well, it’s been a while since I tasted human blood. With you here, I can have a hearty meal…”</p>
<p>As the human-faced flea spoke, he suddenly chuckled wickedly, and at the same time, the atmosphere in the cave changed, thickening the air and making it hard to breathe.</p>
<p>All those who entered the cave had already stored their true qi in their dantian, automatically holding their breath like they were diving into water. However, the thickened air here seemed to consume true qi rapidly. In such a situation, it was difficult to maintain a spiritual shield while holding one’s breath.</p>
<p>Just then, countless large fleas began to attack, and everyone had to swing their swords wildly in response. However, when Gao Cang cut down one flea, the green liquid splattered onto his clothes, burning through them and causing him to scream in pain.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The same happened to the others. The only one not splashed with the liquid was Ranran. When the insect juice sprayed over, Su Yi Shui immediately pulled her into his arms, protecting her securely. The liquid splashed onto his back,  Ranran lifted her head and she could tell from his furrowed brows that it must have burned him severely.</p>
<p>Bai Baishan accidentally got bitten by a flea, and his right arm went numb instantly, making it impossible for him to hold his sword.</p>
<p>However, the large fleas kept coming relentlessly, seemingly endless. If this continued, they would all become numb from the flea bites. Killing the fleas would surely result in the splashing of the dreadful liquid.</p>
<p>By then, they wouldn’t need the fleas to eat them; the corrosive liquid alone would dissolve their bodies.</p>
<p>This north gate turned out to be so perilous. Mu Ranwu, hiding behind two attendants who seemed impervious to pain, cursed angrily, “Xue Ranran, look at what you’ve done, choosing such a sinister gate!”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran wanted to roll her eyes at her. She didn’t deceive this Elder Mu to come in, Mu Ranwu eagerly followed but now blamed others.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran knew that they couldn’t go on like this. So she shouted at the human-faced flea, “Your chess skills are just so-so, yet you keeping playing? Even I’m feeling embarrassed for you!”</p>
<p>This angered thousands of large fleas, and their angry buzzing made everyone’s ears numb.</p>
<p>Then, the sound of the fleas suddenly stopped. As the fleas receded like a tide, the human-faced flea lifted his head, waved his claws, and said ominously, “Little brat, how dare you say my chess skills are bad?”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran nodded and pointed at Su Yi Shui, “My Shifu is the real chess master. Would you dare to challenge him?”</p>
<p>The human-faced flea disdainfully glanced at Su Yi Shui and chuckled, “Alright, it’s been a while since I played chess with someone! If you win, I’ll let you leave, but if you lose… I’ll suck all of you dry until only your skins are left!”</p>
<p>Ranran turned to her master, extremely certain, “Shifu, it’s up to you next!”</p>
<p>But Su Yi Shui looked at her strangely and said in a low voice, “When did I ever play chess?”</p>
<p>Now everyone else is getting nervous. Bai Baishan eagerly said, “But Shifu, your chess skills are really quite good. You often set up chess in your study and play alone!”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui’s expression turned cold. Although he had noticed the chess set in his study, he had no memory of playing chess at all.</p>
<p>Ranran deflated, squatting down. She guessed the reason. Su Yi Shui’s chess skills should have been taught by the past Mu Qingge. Unfortunately, at this critical moment, he had completely forgotten this life-saving skill.</p>
<p>After asking around, except for Xue Ranran, who had studied the chess manuals in her master’s study and played a few games with Su Yi Shui before, no one else knew how to play.</p>
<p>However, Shen Kuo spoke up, “I have some knowledge about it. Why don’t you let me handle it?”</p>
<p>But the large flea disagreed. It jumped high and said with an eerie tone, “Didn’t you say the little pretty boy would play? We can’t change players now!”</p>
<p>Among those who came in, the most handsome man was the one with the cold face. The human-faced flea despised handsome young men the most.</p>
<p>If this man was sucked dry and turned into skin, it would be quite a sight!</p>
<p>Thinking of this, the flea waved its claws and conjured up a huge chessboard, smiling gloomily, “Just playing chess is boring. Let’s use people as pieces to play!”</p>
<p>After saying that, it directed a flea to jump onto the huge chessboard.</p>
<p>At this point, Qiu Xier couldn’t take it anymore and shouted, “How do we play this? You have countless fleas, but we only have a few people. Won’t we run out of pieces soon?”</p>
<p>The human-faced flea barked loudly, making everyone’s eardrums tingle, “I don’t care! Figure it out yourselves! If you don’t even have this ability, how chould you challenge me in chess?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui stood beside the chessboard, looking dour like a bad chess player. Ranran channeled, “I didn’t know you forgot how to play chess, Shifu. Shall we bluff through a couple of moves first? I’ll tell you where to move the pieces, but the pieces…”</p>
<p>Inside this cave, there were no available stones to use. So, after some thought, Ranran handed her shoe, which she had changed out of in the morning, to Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>Who said we must use people? Using objects should work too, right? As long as there are pieces on the chessboard.</p>
<p>However, as soon as the shoe touched the chessboard, it burst into flames and burned to ashes, leaving nothing behind.</p>
<p>The human-faced flea smirked, “This chessboard is condensed from malevolent qi. If someone with insufficient cultivation enters, they will turn to ash. So, what do you say? If you can’t handle it, just admit defeat obediently. I’ll make you all look good, using your skins as bed covers!”</p>
<p>Just then, Gao Cang rushed over, “Shifu, let me do it. Where should I stand?”</p>
<p>After he asked, Su Yi Shui also looked at Ranran, but Ranran didn’t dare to make a rash decision. This chessboard was too sinister. What if senior brother turned to ashes if he went down? Moreover, as third sister said, their numbers were limited. Even if they added Mu Ranwu’s group, they wouldn’t last long. Once there were no pieces left, wouldn’t that be considered a loss?</p>
<p>But for now, they could only delay. Gao Cang had seen Shifu play chess before, so at least he knew the basics of the first three moves.</p>
<p>So he jumped onto the chessboard first, landing on the left side of the flea.</p>
<p>Just then, as if finding it not exciting enough, the human-faced flea added, “I love fast-paced games and hate dragging things out. If each move takes more than five minutes, then the ones who moved earlier will be invaded by malevolent qi and turn into fleas! No regrets after the move! No regrets after the move!”<br/>*半盏茶<em> is about 5-7min</em></p>
<p>After saying this, it chuckled wickedly again.</p>
<p>This thing was really not good. It only mentioned this rule after Gao Cang jumped down. Now Gao Cang was dumbfounded. In other words, if Shifu couldn’t win within a few dozen moves and there were no pieces left, everyone who jumped down would turn into something neither human nor ghost!</p>
<p>How short was half a cup of tea’s time! Seeing time running out, Qiu Xier panicked and shouted, “Shifu, hurry, I’ll jump second!”</p>
<p>At this critical moment, the usually timid Qiu Xier actually volunteered to jump second, not wanting her senior brother to become a disgusting bug!</p>
<p>Just then, Su Yi Shui heard Ranran channel, “Left third line, fourth line intersection…”</p>
<p>So Su Yi Shui echoed her words, and after counting, Qiu Xier quickly jumped down. The people around her exclaimed, “Qiu Xier, you jumped to the wrong spot!”</p>
<p>It turned out that in her haste, she counted the lines wrong and ended up jumping next to Gao Cang. This move was as good as not making one at all.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier also felt foolish, tears welling up as she looked at Gao Cang. However, Gao Cang held her hand to comfort her, “You don’t know how to play chess, so making mistakes is normal.”</p>
<p>This made the human-faced flea burst into laughter with delight, “A bunch of useless fools, you’ll all wait to become human skins!”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As it directed another flea to jump into the malevolent qi chessboard, a melodious song suddenly sounded from the side, as Ranran started humming a tune.</p>
<p>This left everyone puzzled. Even Mu Ranwu sneered and taunted, “Xue Ranran, are you also scared silly? Do you think singing can disrupt the human-faced flea’s chess game?”</p>
<p>Ranran seemed not to hear her sarcastic words and continued to sing. Her voice grew louder and louder. Perhaps even Shifu Su Yi Shui had forgotten that this song she was humming, was heard in the secret cave on Tianmai Mountain.</p>
<p>Back then, she had subdued the Vermilion Bird using this melodious and gentle song. According to Shen Kuo, this human-faced flea was once a close friend of the powerful Dun Tian and also loved Rong Yao.</p>
<p>So Ranran had no other plan and decided to use Rong Yao’s song to test the human-faced flea’s reaction.</p>
<p>Just as the human-faced flea was about to make a move, it suddenly looked up, its face twisted with agitation.</p>
<p>If Mu Ranwu hadn’t reminded it with that sarcastic remark just now, it would have almost missed the timing to put down the piece. So after it did, it immediately asked impatiently, “How…. how do you know this song? Shut up! Stop singing!”</p>
<p>Why would Ranran heed it? Its agitated state played right into her hands, so she jumped down as the third pawn piece without warning.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui had not expected her to jump down without hesitation. When he tried to reach out to pull her up, he was too late.</p>
<p>He slowly clutched his chest with his hand, where he felt his heart lurch just now. What kind of sorcery had this little demoness used on him? Just now, he had felt a sensation as if his chest was about to explode.</p>
<p>But the singing grew louder.</p>
<p>The human-faced flea’s expression was now completely twisted, looking confused and flustered, seemingly trying hard to endure something. It strained to put down another flea.</p>
<p>This time, Su Yi Shui jumped down and landed next to Ranran.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t expect him to jump down with her. He was the one playing chess, there was no reason for him to place himself on the chessboard and act as a piece?</p>
<p>But Su Yishui channeled to her, “Focus, and don’t stop singing!”</p>
<p>Ranran quickly steadied her mind and continued to sing. However, she couldn’t help but reach out to hold the large hand beside her.</p>
<p>She didn’t know if they could break out of this deadly chess formation, but before dying, she must hold onto his hand tightly…</p>
<p>The large hand she held hesitated for a moment before slowly tightening around hers. Ranran focused her mind and continued to sing calmly.</p>
<p>Just as the human-faced flea irritably placed another piece, Bai Baishan nudged Shen Kuo, who was staring blankly, “I’ve been off the mountain for months, and my cultivation isn’t as good as yours. I will probably not be able to counter the malevolent qi on the chessboard, so you go next!”</p>
<p>There’s an order to follow, to respect seniority, where the disciples should go first, then the uncle masters to follow. When there’s no one left, they’ll leave it to fate.</p>
<p>But Bai Baishan currently had the lowest cultivation and couldn’t even match Qiu Xier, so he let Shen Kuo jump first.</p>
<p>After a moment of hesitation, Shen Kuo followed the senior brother’s order and jumped down.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran’s singing never stopped. At first, the large flea frowned and tried to concentrate on the game.</p>
<p>But that girl’s singing voice is really so alike Rong Yao’s! Even the tremolo at the end of the notes is exactly the same. In a daze, when he looked over at the girl, he seemed to see Rong Yao from years ago, in a pink dress, with a charming smile…</p>
<p>But it’s hateful that Dun Tian was solely focused on seeking enlightenment, leading to her soul scattering. If she had chosen him back then, even if he turned into a devil or a demon, he would never allow anyone to harm her in the slightest!</p>
<p>Overwhelmed with rage, and seeing that girl’s hand intertwined with the man beside her, he seemed to be transported back to the painful moment when he had lost his beloved.</p>
<p>At that time, she had left holding Dun Tian’s hand without looking back… When he placed his next piece, he was too slow, and exceeded the stipulated time.</p>
<p>In an instant, all the fleas on the large chessboard screamed and turned into ashes.</p>
<p>By this point, most of the people from Xishan had stepped onto the chessboard. Even Bai Baishan, whose cultivation was insufficient, had jumped onto the board, meaning they were almost out of pieces and nearly had to admit defeat and face death.</p>
<p>But now, the human-faced flea had violated its own rules. So they automatically won the game, and the malevolent qi inside the evil formation gradually dissipated. The large chessboard also vanished into nothingness, and the oppressive and solidified air also dissipated.</p>
<p>Just as the formation was about to break open, the human-faced flea suddenly leaped in front of Ranran and, in a daze, stared at her, asking, “Who are you exactly? How do you know how to sing Rong Yao’s song? Could it be… you’re her?”</p>
<p>He wanted to ask more, but the malevolent qi had dissipated, and his form couldn’t be sustained for long. When the exit of the formation opened, the demonic fleas inside had disappeared without a trace, leaving only the faint cries of the creature in agony, “Rong Yao, why did you choose him and not me…”</p>
<p>As they stepped back onto the slightly warm ground, the Five Fiends Formation was behind them.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After catching her breath, Ranran felt a bit melancholic. The despair in the creature’s slightly crazed eyes made one’s heart ache. If there were other ways, she didn’t want to sing the song of his beloved, stirring up his painful memories.</p>
<p>The word “love”, can truly lead one to descend into darkness. She couldn’t help but look towards Su Yi Shui. What would happen between them in the future? She felt rather lost in her heart. Its better if he couldn’t remember her, this way, maybe he could calmly accept it when her vitality qi ran out, instead of sacrificing half his life for her like before?</p>
<p>As she thought about it, Ranran’s heart was filled with a hint of sorrow. Yet, at this moment, she realized she had been holding Su Yi Shui’s large hand all along…</p>
<p>Of course, Qiu Xier also held Gao Cang’s hand tightly as they exited the formation.</p>
<p>But because of this, made things even more awkward. As Qiu Xier quickly let go of her senior brother’s hand, she glanced at Ranran and the hand she was holding with Shifu.</p>
<p>What was going on? Did Shifu get possessed by the Spirit Spring again? Why was he holding onto junior sister like that?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran also wanted to let go, but Su Yi Shui seemed to have no intention of letting go. Instead, he pulled her over and sternly said, “Don’t act on your own next time. Why did you jump down without saying a word? Don’t you know the chessboard is condensed with malevolent qi, extremely dangerous? How are you, do you feel uncomfortable?”</p>
<p>Before Ranran could answer, Qiu Xier muttered from the side, “Shifu, Senior brother jumped first just now, shouldn’t you… show some concern for senior brother first?”</p>
<p>Gao Cang, completely clueless about the ambiguous situation between Master and junior sister, patted his chest and said to Su Yi Shui, “For Master, I would go through fire and water without hesitation. Don’t worry, I’m tough!”</p>
<p>With these two clowns running their gag, Su Yi Shui finally let go of Ranran’s hand slowly, but his eyes were still coldly fixed on the girl who acted on her own.</p>
<p>Ranran had no choice, while the seniors discussed the situation of others inside the formation, she said in a small voice, “Alright, I was wrong, I’ll listen to Shifu’s arrangements next time… But junior brother Yue Sheng hasn’t come out of the West Gate yet, I don’t know how he’s doing…”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Just then, Mu Ranwu also emerged from the formation.</p>
<p>The method Ranran used to break the formation just now was also confusing to her. How could Ranran break the formation so easily just by singing a song?</p>
<p>In her previous life, every time she practiced meditation, she was always left far behind by her sister. Master favored her sister, and if her sister comprehended something, he wouldn’t explain further and just let her teach herself after.</p>
<p>Now, seeing Xue Ranran break the formation so effortlessly, that sense of frustration of not being able to catch up with her once again surfaced.</p>
<p>Back then, she had used the Fate Transfer ancient jade she had obtained by chance and died together with her sister. At the moment when she stuffed the ancient jade engraved with their two names into her sister’s hand, she clearly saw her sister’s surprised look at the ancient jade, and then she smiled serenely and held it tightly.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge had known what that was, but she was nonchalant, not caring at all.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu recalled the information she had sent people to inquire about in Juefeng Village, saying that when Xue Ranran was born, she had patterns resembling “Ran” on her hand, so the carpenter couple named her “Ranran.” Now, thinking back, those birthmarks was from the “Ran” character branded from her name on the ancient jade.</p>
<p>That was the clear evidence that she had deliberately stolen her sister’s destiny and cultivation.</p>
<p>But this reincarnated girl still lived so leisurely, completely unconcerned that her innate talents and cultivation had been stolen completely, while effortlessly captivating and gaining the affection of those around her.</p>
<p>This kind of *carefree and free spirited attitude, made the thief Mu Ranwu feel not an ounce of joy but rather a sense of inexplicable inferiority and frustration.<br/>*千金散尽还复来 from poem 李白《将进酒》放荡不羁，纵情享乐的豪放品质</p>
<p>Because Mu Ranwu finally realized that whether the elegant figure before her was Mu Qingge or Xue Ranran, she was beyond her reach, someone she could never catch up to…</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">揭露真相   REVEALING THE TRUTH</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>In the afterglow of the setting sun, Mu Ranwu looked at the smiling pretty girl who stood beside the tall and handsome Su Yi Shui, and a familiar mix of envy and hatred, the desire to replace her once again surging within her.</p>
<p>In this life, where exactly did she fall short compared to Xue Ranran! Why did even fools like Wang Suizhi and Qin Xuanjiu, who had been captivated by her, all abandoned her one after the other?</p>
<p>And Xue Ranran was calm and relaxed as she reclaimed everything that had belonged to her!</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Mu Ranwu’s nails once again dug deep into her palms…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, within the Five Fiends Formation, the wails and screams of despair continued. Because of their different choices, their encounters were also different.</p>
<p>Yue Sheng counted on his considerable cultivation and a bit of cleverness. He went alone with the people from the Yiren Hall into the West Gate. In hindsight, his odds did not seem good…</p>
<p>Just then, the Feiyun Sect and two elders from the Kongshan sect stumbled out from the East Gate. However, they seemed poisoned, their faces had turned purple-blue.</p>
<p>Seeing this, the disciples from Xishan dared not assist directly by holding them, only hurriedly handing over gourds filled with detoxifying pills and water bags.</p>
<p>After the elders have taken the detoxifying pills and spat out black blood in meditation, they regained their composure enough to explain what had happened. They had entered the Mosquito Mirage Formation. The mosquitoes’ stingers were filled with potent venom, and they also suffered a depletion of their cultivation, barely managing to escape.</p>
<p>As for the other formation gates where no one had come out yet, including the renowned Jiuhua Sect, it seemed like they were completely annihilated, with not a single person emerging.</p>
<p>The once prestigious Jiuhua Sect, as the foremost of the Three Great Sects, was now on an unstoppable decline…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>At this moment, there was movement at the West Gate as well. A person staggered and fell out.</p>
<p>It was Old Feng, blood streaming from his eyes, seemingly blinded. He crawled and rolled on the ground, wailing in agony. Also stumbling out was Yue Sheng, his right arm severed, likely never to wield a sword with his exquisite skill again.</p>
<p>It turned out they had entered the Mirage Shadow Formation. When Old Feng initially used his Yin-Yang Eyes to inspect, he saw no terrifying creatures inside, so he chose that location.</p>
<p>His eyesight was accurate. Indeed, there were no demonic entities like in the other four formations.</p>
<p>However, what he had never anticipated was that the most terrifying aspect of this formation was the people who entered it.</p>
<p>Upon entering, the formation’s qi would enhance everyone’s potential to the maximum while also amplifying their greed. As they turned against each other, they could absorb each other’s abilities and qi. If they could slaughter everyone inside, the cultivation gained in half a day within the formation could rival that of many experts’ lifetimes.</p>
<p>Old Feng’s pride, his Yin-Yang Eyes, became the coveted ability of everyone inside.</p>
<p>In short, the Mirage Shadow Formation was adept at confusing the mind, inciting those inside to kill each other. When they lost what was most precious to them, they could leave the formation.</p>
<p>Old Feng lost his eyesight from Yue Sheng’s attack, and Yue Sheng was disfigured and lost his right arm due to Old Feng.</p>
<p>But when they came out, the cultivation and qi they had gained inside the formation dissipated like a deflating balloon, leaving them with nothing.</p>
<p>These two men suddenly awoke as if from a dream, unable to comprehend why they had lost their sanity inside the formation and crazily turned against each other. In the end, it was all for naught, like water poured into a bamboo basket, a fruitless endeavor.</p>
<p>Watching her disfigured and disabled junior brother rolling on the ground in pain and tears, Ranran hurriedly joined others in bandaging him. </p>
<p>However, she couldn’t muster any sympathy for this junior. If he hadn’t been so foolish as to rush into the West Gate, he wouldn’t have ended up like this.</p>
<p>Yue Sheng was now clearly unable to continue on their journey. So, Shen Kuo who had a close relationship with him, spoke up, volunteering to stay behind on the mountain to take care of his junior brother until their master returned.</p>
<p>With this arrangement, the only ones to remain uninjured to reach the main gate of Crimson Gate, were the group from Xishan, Mu Ranwu’s group, along with a few recovered elders from Kongshan and Feiyun.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan had already been standing at the entrance to “welcome” the guests who had come from afar.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu had kept his promise; anyone who passed through the Evil Formation would be warmly welcomed.</p>
<p>As they entered Crimson Gate, drinks and food were already laid out in the main hall. Wei Jiu, clad in a lavish black robe, sat at the high seat to greet the Xishan group.</p>
<p>When he had set up the Five Fiends Formation earlier, he sat atop Red Flame Mountain, watching the tumultuous formations below with a leisurely swish of his wine cup, biding his time.</p>
<p>The fact that the people from Xishan chose the seemingly most dangerous north gate greatly surprised Wei Jiu. Anyone with a bit of sense could see the peril of the north gate. Unfortunately, Xue Ranran had foolishly followed Su Yi Shui into danger, and Wei Jiu wondered if they would safely make it out.</p>
<p>Thinking of the letter the brat had sent him with just one “get lost” written in it, Wei Jiu seethed with anger every time he recalled it.</p>
<p>The girl had rejected him repeatedly, not knowing her place. It served her right to suffer a bit! Otherwise, she wouldn’t know how lenient he had been with her.</p>
<p>Although Wei jiu felt his hatred slaked when he thought that Xue Ranran could die gruesomely in the formation, seeing them emerge alive still made him breathe a sigh of relief for her.</p>
<p>Even though she did not have him in her heart, if she had died in the formation, it would have been still somewhat regrettable for Wei Jiu. If she were to die… she should die by his hand!</p>
<p>Wei Jiu didn’t realize at all how twisted his thoughts had become, just chuckling darkly as he eyed Xue Ranran who seemed to have become even more beautiful .</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran hadn’t expected *a grand feast after the harrowing Five Fiends Formation. She wondered about the meaning behind Wei Jiu’s hospitality.<br/>*鸿门宴 <strong>不怀好意、居心不良的邀宴，比喻想要加害客人的宴会</strong></p>
<p>Wei Jiu lazily said, “We had some unpleasantness with Xishan due to the Spirit Spring incident before. However, with the influx of Netherworld creatures and chaos in the world, my Crimson Gate sect naturally can’t stay out of it. While the rumors of the Tempering Flame being on Red Flame Mountain are rife, I’ve never seen it for myself. The Five Fiends Formation earlier was also a test of your strength; otherwise, if anyone and everyone could enter my gates, wouldn’t that be too chaotic?”</p>
<p>The elders of Feiyun Sect had mostly purged the mosquito poison completely by now. Hearing Wei Jiu’s words and remembering their disciples lost in the formation, they gritted their teeth in anger and asked in a hard voice, “So, does Excellency Wei mean that you agree to let us take the Tempering Flame?”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu’s face, usually soft and gentle, now bore a sly smile. “I agree, but the premise is that after finding the Tempering Flame, you must have the ability to take it away!”</p>
<p>He had hidden meanings in his words, leisurely assessing everyone present but showing clear intentions of a temporary ceasefire.</p>
<p>The people who arrived here originally thought they would have to do another fierce battle with the Crimson Gate people, but they didn’t expect Wei Jiu to be so accommodating. For a moment, they were somewhat skeptical, unsure of what schemes this demonic leader had in mind.</p>
<p>However, Wei Jiu courteously arranged rooms for them and allowed them to search for the Tempering Flame on the hottest back mountain of Red Flame Mountain the following day.</p>
<p>But the people going up the mountain clearly didn’t want to stay at the main hall of Crimson Gate. Instead, they directly went to camp at the back mountain. Although it was hotter there, without the shelter of the courtyard walls, they could watch out for each other for any ambushes from the Crimson Gate people with a few people in formation.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After these guests have dispersed, Tu Jiuyuan quietly asked, “Your Excellency, are you really letting them search everywhere on Red Flame Mountain? The Netherworld creatures causing chaos in the world have nothing to do with us?”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu snorted coldly, “Elder Tu, what do you think about the temperature on the mountain this year?”</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan thought for a moment and replied, “Compared to the year before, it seems much hotter…”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu narrowed his eyes, “Although my Crimson Gate belongs to fire, my disciples are not barbecued meat. If Red Flame Mountain continues to rise in temperature like this, my Crimson Gate will have to abandon its century-old foundation and rare martial sanctum. If I’m not mistaken, it must be the Tempering Flame causing the continuous rise in temperature on Red Flame Mountain. So, it’s best if they can help me find this thing. When the time comes, I’ll take it for myself, and the world will have to rely on us, Crimson Gate, for peace…”</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan understood Wei Jiu’s hidden agenda of the praying mantis catching cicadas, with the oriole lurking behind.</p>
<p>And the Five Fiends Formation he set up was also to sift out usable talents while also weakening the strength of the righteous path. Even if they found the Tempering Flame, they would be outnumbered and unable to prevent Crimson Gate from taking advantage.</p>
<p>By that time, Crimson Gate could reap the benefits.</p>
<p>However, it greatly surprised Tu Jiuyuan that the West Mountain faction only had one disciple who got injured and the others managed to ascend the mountain unscathed.</p>
<p>Thinking of Xue Ranran, Tu Jiuyuan touched the wound that had not yet healed in her chest, feeling a complex mix of emotions.</p>
<p>She was an orphan, adopted by Crimson Gate since childhood, with her hands already stained with countless kills. In spite of her ruthless nature, she never liked owing anything to anyone, especially not favors or debts of gratitude.</p>
<p>Back in the Netherworld, if it wasn’t for Xue Ranran’s help, she would have died there, never to be reincarnated.</p>
<p>This debt of gratitude had to be repaid at some point. Thinking of this, Tu Jiuyuan left the hall, called a servant, and ordered them to prepare more ice water to be sent to the West Mountain group on the back mountain. It would seem too out of the ordinary if she only gave it to Xue Ranran, possibly arousing unnecessary suspicion from Wei Jiu, so Tu Jiuyuan decided to extend her hospitality to all, sending everyone ice water to cool down with.</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan sighed. Red Flame Mountain was indeed too hot, and that delicate-looking girl must be finding the scorching heat unbearable right now…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Xue Ranran was indeed feeling very hot, envying her fellow disciples who could go shirtless.</p>
<p>By the time they reached the back mountain, she had already removed her outer robe, leaving only a thin shirt. Even so, she earnestly considered if she was able to remove another layer.</p>
<p>However, after a while, she felt a refreshing chill. Turning her head, she saw that Su Yi Shui had sat next to her at some point and had quite naturally created a spiritual shield with his true qi, keeping the waves of scorching heat outside.</p>
<p>He still wore his long robes and crown, looking neat and composed, not a single bead of sweat on his forehead.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t dare to casually use her true qi now, certainly not to indulge in such extravagance. She wiped the sweat from her forehead and smiled gratefully at her master.</p>
<p>Seeing the glistening sweat on Ranran’s fair skin, her thin shirt soaked through, accentuating her slender figure, Su Yi Shui suddenly felt flustered.</p>
<p>Feeling the temperature inside the spiritual shield rise, making her sweat slightly again, she couldn’t help but say, “Shifu, you should retract the shield. The temperature inside is not much different from the outside…”</p>
<p>Reminded by Ranran, Su Yi Shui reluctantly moved his gaze away from her sweaty face and focused on channeling his true qi again, and so the temperature inside the shield suddenly dropped significantly again.</p>
<p>Before long, several buckets of ice water with ice were delivered by Crimson Gate’s servants.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu was one who knew how to enjoy life. He used a spiritual shield to create an ice cave, so even if Red Flame Mountain was scorching hot, there was still cold water to drink.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier didn’t know that this was Tu Jiuyuan repaying Xue Ranran’s life-saving favor and specially ordered the ice water. She thought it was Wei Jiu being attentive to Xue Ranran once again.</p>
<p>Back then, Wei Jiu had sent so many things to West Mountain! So Qiu Xier stared blankly at Xue Ranran and asked, “I thought Wei Jiu had given up on you. Why is he sending ice water to bother you again? You shouldn’t drink the water he sent!”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui turned his head slightly and asked Xue Ranran, “That Wei Jiu pestered you?”</p>
<p>Ranran thought about it and felt that Wei Jiu wasn’t really pestering her. That Demon Lord cared about his dignity a lot; after bumping into walls too many times, he wouldn’t deliberately seek to be snubbed again.</p>
<p>So she asked the servant who brought the water who had ordered it.</p>
<p>The servant replied, “Elder Tu said that all guests are treated equally, so we prepared some ice water to cool you down.”</p>
<p>Sure enough, soon after, the disciples from Kongshan and Feiyun, as well as Mu Ranwu’s group, all received ice water, treating everyone equally.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t ask any further. However, she couldn’t help but think of Tu Jiuyuan.</p>
<p>When Ranran was about to leave the main hall, she murmured that having ice water would be nice, and Tu Jiuyuan had glanced at her then… If that was the case, Tu Jiuyuan was also a person of character…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After Su Yishui finished asking his question and waited for a while, but did not get a response from Ranran, he noticed that she had started daydreaming, with a faint smile on her lips.</p>
<p>Could it be that Wei Jiu’s small attentions and consideration had moved the young girl’s heart and made her think of him so easily?</p>
<p>Thinking of Mu Ranwu in the past life, who had also seemed easily seduced, Su Yi Shui’s heart sank, an unfamiliar sour feeling rising gradually in him.</p>
<p>He suddenly remembered that Ranran had mentioned she had someone in her heart, and it was a narrow-minded man with a bad character.</p>
<p>Back then, Su Yi Shui was still thinking, could there really be such an annoying man in the world?</p>
<p>But now, he had an epiphany. Could it be… that the man this girl said that everyone thought was bad… is the demonic cultivator Wei Jiu?</p>
<p>At this moment, he wasn’t thinking about whether Ranran would betray them on the battlefield but rather felt a stifling sensation rising within him. No matter how he suppressed it, it couldn’t be suppressed—after all, she was also his disciple in this life. How could she be so naive and inexperienced? Just anyone could enchant her so completely!</p>
<p>“…That Wei Jiu might be rather good-looking, but he lacks the demeanor of a man. You’ve not seen too many men, don’t be deceived by mere sweet words.”</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Su Yi Shui who rarely put on the airs of a master, now lectured his disciple in a stern manner.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t understand why Wei Jiu was suddenly mentioned. She didn’t dare to drink the iced water, she just moved it closer to fan herself and cool down. But she couldn’t agree with her Shifu’s sudden comment. She didn’t think she had seen too few men, so she replied in a small voice, “Who said I’ve seen few men? At least you look more handsome than Wei Jiu…”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui usually hated it when others commented on his appearance, but when this young girl earnestly said with widened eyes, that he looked more handsome than Wei Jiu, he suddenly felt very pleased.</p>
<p>So the temperature inside the spiritual shield turned icy cold again, and there was no need for that bucket of iced water!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The next day, before the sun had risen, the temperature on Red Flame Mountain had dropped slightly, and everyone discussed taking advantage of this to search for the Tempering Flame.</p>
<p>Great battles by Dun Tian had raged here before, and the rugged rocks bore traces of the fierce fights from that time.</p>
<p>For example, the only river valley on Red Flame Mountain seemed to have been created by a massive spiritual force.</p>
<p>As everyone began their search, Wei Jiu also appeared. He stood at the edge of a cliff, silently watching the expressionless guards around Mu Ranwu for a while before suddenly speaking, “She’s even gotten involved with the Fan Tian Sect. Dim-witted yet wants to play with eagles… not afraid of being pecked in the eyes by the eagles, interesting!”</p>
<p>At that moment, he saw Xue Ranran standing beside Su Yi Shui. Xue Ranran seemed to be saying something, but the man beside her remained unsmiling, and it seemed that she was being given the cold shoulder.</p>
<p>Seeing Ranran feeling ill at ease, Wei Jiu, after so many days, finally felt a rare sense of satisfaction. So, it was not in vain that he had cooperated with the Fan Tian Sect back then, exchanging the ancient text for Elder Jiu.</p>
<p><em>The Soul-Cleansing Talisman was truly marvelous!</em></p>
<p>Wei Jiu decided to add fuel to the fire and make Xue Ranran’s days in Xishan more unbearable. So he instructed an attendant to hold a large umbrella and he gracefully descended from the cliff, standing in front of Su Yi Shui with a smiling expression.</p>
<p>“Why, are you still letting this girl stay by your side? I seem to remember you hated her so much in her past life?”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Xue Ranran suddenly raised her head, immediately understanding what Wei Jiu was getting at.</p>
<p>Just now, she just had a fight with Shifu. She had clearly urged him not to replenish true qi for her again. But last night, while she was asleep, Su Yi Shui had still transferred a considerable amount of true qi to her.</p>
<p>After this morning’s meditation, when he, who had always been strong and vigorous, got up, his legs unexpectedly gave out, causing Ranran’s heart to ache when she saw this.</p>
<p>So she had just solemnly “warned” her Shifu that if he transferred qi again, she wouldn’t hesitate to leave without a word, seeking a corner to die alone.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui’s face also turned cold as he said sullenly, “Xue Ranran, you’ve grown quite audacious, daring to threaten me? You have the aura of my golden core on you; even if you hide in a dung heap, I can still drag you out!”</p>
<p>So the master and disciple coldly ignored each other, and did not speak to each other.</p>
<p>Just then, Wei Jiu, dressed in black robes like a crow, suddenly descended from the sky, chattering endlessly.</p>
<p>Before he could speak any further, Ranran had already rushed in front of Su Yi Shui, and said warily, “Lord Wei, please step aside. Your presence here is making my compass unstable.”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu naturally understood that she wanted to silence him. The feeling of finally having the little girl in his control was too enjoyable!</p>
<p>He then lowered his voice deliberately and raised his eyebrows, saying, “What? Is it your compass that’s unstable, or is it your heart that’s too scared to move? Oh right, you still don’t know how much your master hated Mu Qingge back then! He really wished for an arrow to pierce her heart… Ah, damn it… Su, you actually sneak attacked!”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu didn’t know that his deliberate intimidation of Xue Ranran, as seen by the person who was under the soul-cleansing talisman effect, had appeared like a ruffian harassing a beautiful respectable lady.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu was actually so arrogant, that he would shamelessly tease his disciple right in front of him.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui had never taken Wei Jiu seriously, so he raised his hand and launched a thunderous attack at Wei Jiu.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu was a bit arrogant on his own turf, and they had just agreed to a truce yesterday. He didn’t expect Su Yi Shui to turn hostile so quickly and he narrowly missed being struck by the lightning.</p>
<p>“Stay away from my disciple, or don’t blame me for being rude!” After retracting the thunderbolt attack, Su Yi Shui warned him lightly.</p>
<p>Ranran saw the twisted smile of anger on Wei Jiu’s face and thought to herself, “This is bad, it looks like this lunatic won’t keep his mouth shut now…”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Sure enough, Wei Jiu sneered and decided to stir up a big hornet’s nest for the master and disciple from Xishan, saying, “What disciple? Have you been brainwashed by the Soul-Cleansing Talisman? She’s undoubtedly your Master! Haven’t you discovered, that Xue Ranran is actually the reincarnation of Mu Qingge?!”</p>
<p>His words were like a thunderbolt, causing everyone present to look at him in astonishment.</p>
<p>At first, Mu Ranwu was a bit confused about what was happening, but when Wei Jiu mentioned the “Soul-Cleansing Talisman,” she suddenly realized what he was up to.</p>
<p>So Su Yi Shui had been ambushed by Wei Jiu, who erased his memories of affection for her sister… Of course she knew how much Su Yi Shui used to hate her sister. If Su Yi Shui had returned to his former self, it would be quite… interesting!</p>
<p>So, even though Wei Jiu had just revealed the secret that Mu Ranwu had been desperately hiding, Mu Ranwu was feeling extremely ecstatic. The people she had brought were all from the Fan Tian Sect, with none of those foolish loyal disciples, so it didn’t matter if she admitted to this.</p>
<p>When she saw that Su Yi Shui seemed to not believe Wei Jiu’s words, she calmly said, “Big sister, why haven’t you told Yi Shui the truth? You’re the reincarnation of Mu Qingge, but in order to stay by Su Yi Shui’s side, you exchanged identities with me and pretended to be an inexperienced young girl… Your obsessive dedication is truly admirable, even to me, your sister!”</p>
<p>Ranran knew that Mu Ranwu was talking nonsense, but her choice of words was deliberately aimed at provoking Su Yi Shui’s raw nerves .</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui had always hated Mu Qingge’s *persistent pursuit of him in the past, when she forced him to become her disciple and also teased him from time to time.<br/>*死缠烂打 <em>persistent pursuit/harassment</em></p>
<p>If Su Yi Shui misunderstood and thought that Ranran was pretending to be Mu Ranwu to continue pursuing him… then given Su Yi Shui’s current ferocious nature, he would definitely tear her apart and dip her in sauce…</p>
<p>But now was not the time to desperately shout, “<em>Please listen to my explanation</em>” so Ranran decided not to waste time on useless things. She simply and clearly channeled a message to Su Yi Shui, whose eyes were gradually turning red as he stared at her, “There are urgent matters at hand. It doesn’t matter who I am. Right now, we need to find the Tempering Flame and Elder Jiu. Once you regain your memories, I will leave it to your discretion on how to deal with me…”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui was actually waiting for this girl to explain herself. As long as she was willing to give an explanation, no matter how absurd her words were, he was willing to believe her for now.</p>
<p>But he didn’t expect that this girl would readily agree with Wei Jiu’s nonsense. She said she would leave it to his discretion? This was indirectly admitting that she… was the reincarnation of Mu Qingge!</p>
<p>Just the thought that he had actually fallen for this female demoness, even without the possession of the Spirit Spring, was enough to make the eyes of the once demon’s son turn red.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">谈谈生意   MAKING A DEAL</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Ranran looked at his chilling gaze, feeling an indescribable bitter taste in her heart. He had forgotten everything, and now he was staring at her as if she were his enemy. He was probably about to break her neck in the next moment?</p>
<p>It’s just as well. She now needed more and more true qi to be replenished, and if Su Yi Shui continued to transfer vitality qi to herself, he would eventually become as emaciated as those boys adopted by Mu Ranwu.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Ranran didn’t even want to evade. She just closed her eyes calmly, as if ready to be slaughtered.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Wei Jiu was ready to act. He was waiting for Su Yi Shui to show murderous intent, so he could rush forward and play the hero to save the beauty.</p>
<p>Although it was Wei Jiu who incited this disciple-master conflict, as long as Xue Ranran wasn’t foolish, she would naturally see who was the one who would protect her at crucial moments.</p>
<p>That Su Yi Shui was just an untamable white-eyed wolf! He just couldn’t remember some memories and he was ready to kill Xue Ranran, how genuine could such love be? It’s chilling just to think about it.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu also smiled coldly and waited to watch the drama of the disciple who kills his master in two lifetimes unfold.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu really did have some tricks up his sleeve. He actually manipulated Elder Jiu to do such things. If her sister died at the hands of Su Yi Shui, that would be the best outcome.</p>
<p>She looked at Xue Ranran with a complicated expression, thinking to herself, “Sister, you can’t blame me for this. If anyone’s to blame, it’s yourself for loving the wrong person…”</p>
<p>On the side, Yutong and Yuchen had faces full of shock.</p>
<p>When Yuchen came to his senses, he immediately glared at Ranran and said, “You witch, what did you intend to do to the master?”</p>
<p>Bai Baishan and Gao Cang hurriedly restrained the agitated Senior Uncle master, and Qiu Xier also blocked and said, “What can she do? Of course, it’s doing meal preparations. Isn’t it always you, Senior Uncle master, who eats the most?”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Yu Chen’s glaring eyes narrowed slightly, feeling a bit speechless for a moment, after all, *since he had always enjoyed her food, he really had no place to criticize her too harshly .<br/>*拿人的手短，吃人的嘴短 <br/>拿了别人的好处，就会刻意礼让三分，即使人家有缺点或者错误也就不敢说、不敢管了</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But after hearing Wei Jiu’s words, Yu Tong suddenly figured everything out.</p>
<p>Why did the Master, who had been depressed for more than twenty years after Mu Qingge’s death, seemed to come alive again after taking in Ranran…</p>
<p>It turned out that Master had been waiting for Mu Qingge to be reborn all along. In his heart…</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Yu Tong disregarded her previous prejudices against Mu Qingge and hurriedly stepped forward to block Su Yi Shui and said anxiously, “Master, you mustn’t! This Ranran, you… you dote on her the most!”</p>
<p>At this moment, Mu Ranwu began to add firewood to the fire, saying calmly, “Yes, if sister schemes carefully, being humble and pleasing to others, that’s what people like the most. Back then, my master also cared for her like Su Yi Shui does now! When my sister was the master, she was respected by Su Yi Shui, and now that she’s the disciple, she still receives his affection. It’s truly enviable!”</p>
<p>What looked like words of envy were actually goading him to action.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it would have been better if she had kept quiet. Just as she finished speaking, Su Yi Shui’s cold and stern gaze shot straight towards her.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu was very afraid of him right now, so when she felt his gaze, she involuntarily stepped back several steps.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Su Yi Shui withdrew his gaze and looked down at the tightly closed eyes of the young girl before him. Her closed eyes seemed quite peaceful, with calm acceptance, like she was seeking death… If she really was Mu Qingge… how could he let her die so easily?</p>
<p>For a moment, Su Yi Shui weighed the pros and cons and suppressed the rage in his heart.</p>
<p>That woman by the side adding fuel to the fire, had no good intentions. Even if he was enraged, Su Yi Shui was not about to do something stupid.</p>
<p>Since she had chosen to be under Xishan in this life, to be his disciple, it was his own business how he disciplined her behind closed doors. He didn’t need people nearby to gloat over the spectacle.</p>
<p>After his anger churned within for a while, he took a deep breath and forcibly suppressed it. After a moment of silence, he then spoke coldly, “What are you all standing around for? Hurry up and use the compass to search!”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Wei Jiu had exposed Xue Ranran’s disguise with the intention of breaking the relationship between this master and disciple of two lifetimes. If Su Yi Shui injured Mu Qingge and put an end to their affection, he really wouldn’t mind undoing the talisman for Su Yi Shui. Then, Su Yi Shui would surely regret it, which would be quite a sight!</p>
<p>But he never expected that after the earth-shattering revelation, Su Yi Shui’s expression only changed a few times and then he acted as if he wanted to keep the peace.</p>
<p>After this bombshell dropped, all the splash landed solely on Wei Jiu’s face, like he was the only one who cared!</p>
<p>So he was somewhat incredulous and asked Su Yi Shui with a long face, “What’s this? Did you know all along?”</p>
<p>Had Su Yi Shui already discovered Xue Ranran’s true identity long ago, so he treated it so casually and unconcernedly?</p>
<p>He wanted to say more, but Ranran swept past him with a flick of her sleeve, saying, “Get out of the way, a good dog doesn’t block the road!” Then, with her small face, she coldly took the compass and walked forward on her own.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu was almost amused, <em>Xue Ranran, you dare to call me a dog? Just wait and see if I will let you leave Red Flame Mountain alive!</em></p>
<p>Right now, he still needed to use these people. Since his instigation failed, he snorted coldly and flew back onto the cliff, continuing to leisurely drink his iced wine.</p>
<p>However, the younger generation of West Mountain lacked the will power of their master and had *completely erupted in an uproar.<br/>*炸锅 突然发生吵闹</p>
<p>After sorting out the relationships (<em>chart lol</em>), Qiu Xier slowly sidled up to Ranran and whispered, “Ranran, should I call you junior sister or grandmaster?”</p>
<p>Ranran sighed, “Ancestor, don’t cause trouble. Hurry up and search. The temperature will rise soon, and we won’t be able to bear it…”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The back mountains of Red Flame Mountain was where the Dun tian once refined the Demon King. As long as the Demon King’s bones didn’t dissolve, his spirit wouldn’t die. Therefore, the true fire capable of refining his true form must be hidden here.</p>
<p>So, this place had the highest temperature in Red Flame Mountain.</p>
<p>Ranran carried Su Yi Shui’s and her own water pouch with her, so she took one and handed it to the silent man beside her, “It’s hot, drink some water to quench your thirst first…”</p>
<p>But when she reached out, he didn’t even look at her, let alone reach out to take it.</p>
<p>Ranran resignedly took back the water pouch, deciding not to talk to Su Yi Shui for the time being.</p>
<p>She didn’t think she had done anything wrong. In the first place, her reincarnation was all his doing. Now that he had forgotten everything, there was no reason for her to blame herself.</p>
<p>Thinking like this, Ranran calmed down and looked at the compass in her hand, wanting to find the Tempering Flame as soon as possible.</p>
<p>So she put away the water pouch and stayed away from Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>But when Ranran withdrew the water pouch this way, Su Yi Shui felt even more disgruntled—no matter how cold he had been before, this little disciple had always stuck close around him, being loyal and filial. </p>
<p>Now that the truth has come out, she couldn’t be bothered to pretend anymore and even avoided him as she walked…</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he coldly said, “Where’s the water? Bring it here then!”</p>
<p>Ranran quickly glanced at him and passed him the water pouch, but when she reached out, he didn’t take it, totally showing a fault-finding expression.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Su Yi Shui reached out to grab her, and took her away from the others with one flying leap. After passing several bare hills, they arrived at a mountain hollow.</p>
<p>He held her chin and pressed her against a bare rock wall, gritting his teeth, “You’ve been deceiving me for so long, Mu Qingge, you are really so capable!”</p>
<p>Seeing his outburst, Ranran actually felt a sense of relief. She just knew that this petty ferocious beast would not react lightly after learning the truth, how could he have been indifferent to it?</p>
<p>But seeing him accusing her, Ranran also felt angry. She forcefully pushed away his hand, “Who wanted to deceive you! If you undid the soul-cleansing talisman, you’ll know, you were the one who was aware of everything from the beginning. As for me, I was clearly your mentor before, but you took me in as your disciple, isn’t that messing up the order of things? When I found out who I was, I wasn’t as mad as you are now!”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui’s was so angry his mouth twisted in a warped smile, “I would voluntarily take you in? You must have used some trickery, otherwise, how could I keep you by my side?”</p>
<p>Feeling resigned, Ranran didn’t want to argue with a stubborn person. She could only say, “Fine, fine, fine, I pretended to be pitiful and deceived you, begging to be accepted as your disciple. After this is over, you can kick me out of West Mountain as you wish. We’ll sever our master-disciple relationship.”</p>
<p>Hearing Ranran say this, Su Yi Shui didn’t even think, but intuitively blurted out, “You dare!”</p>
<p>Ranran felt rather helpless with his reaction. She forcefully squeezed the water pouch in her hand, taking a few big gulps, “Why wouldn’t I dare? You’ve forgotten our past and only remember my faults. Just what did I do to you in the past? Didn’t I raise you beautifully, providing you with food and clothing? As for the matters between us in this lifetime, it’s me alone who remembers and it’s quite vexing. When we meet Elder Jiu, there’s no need to wait for him to undo the talisman on you. I’ll ask him for another soul-cleansing talisman, to erase my memories about you. Then, you’ll be a stranger, and I won’t feel sad no matter how you treat me!”</p>
<p>As she said this, the rims of Ranran’s eyes were red with tears, yet her expression was stubborn, making it impossible for people to… not feel heartache.</p>
<p>At first, Su Yi Shui was still fine, but when he heard her say, that she wanted to completely erase him from her memory, his heart felt like it was being squeezed fiercely again, making it painfully hard to breathe.</p>
<p>The after-effects of spending last night transferring vitality qi also surged up at this moment. Although Su Yi Shui looked fierce, his legs gave out again and he collapsed on Ranran.</p>
<p>He really never expected, that his demonic master in her past life didn’t torment him to death, but now this reincarnated demonic master was about to cause him to die from anger.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran also didn’t expect that the tall man would just collapse so suddenly. She was so frightened that she hurriedly helped him up, while being afraid that Wei Jiu and the others might take advantage of the situation. She could only say in a small voice, “Shifu, Shifu, what’s the matter with you?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui simply hadn’t managed to sustain the flow of his vitality qi. After drinking the water Ranran fed him, he felt much better. He pushed away Ranran’s soft hands trying to wipe the corners of his mouth, “Don’t call me Shifu!”</p>
<p>Ranran paused for a moment and said in a small voice, “But I can’t call you Shui’er either, so… how about calling you Mister Su in the future?”</p>
<p>“Mister Su” sounded proper, but this word inexplicably reminded Su Yi Shui, that he was now older than her. Calling him Mister Su was actually polite, even if she just called him *Uncle Su, it wouldn’t be wrong either…<br/>*伯伯 <em>is</em> <em>Uncle that is older than her father</em></p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Su Yi Shui’s heart became flustered again. Just what was the reason that made him revive this annoying person regardless of the consequences and keep her by his side, making him feel nauseated now and then?</p>
<p>If it weren’t for the time they spent together lately, perhaps he could have just steeled his heart and killed this witch.</p>
<p>But even if he forgot the past completely, the memories of their time together recently were still there. And she had cast a spell on him, causing him to always follow her with his gaze, and if he didn’t see her, he would feel dispirited all day.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui didn’t know what kind of curse Xue Ranran had placed on him, but if this curse wasn’t lifted and she disappeared, wouldn’t it make him feel even worse?</p>
<p>At this moment, Ranran spoke up again, “Um… Mister Su, it’s getting late. Let’s hurry and find the thing…”</p>
<p>But Su Yi Shui remained motionless, his gaze fixed on the cliff face behind Ranran.</p>
<p>The stone wall behind them, similar to burnt stone, originally had nothing unusual about it.</p>
<p>But when Ranran was pressed against the stone wall by Su Yi Shui just now, combined with the hot weather, her sweat seeped into the stone wall.</p>
<p>As a result, as Ranran stood up, a painting suddenly appeared on the stone wall. However, due to the intense heat, the watercolor pattern flashed and then disappeared suddenly.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui took the water pouch from Ranran’s hand and poured it onto the cliff wall. With the steam, a magnificent pattern appeared again.</p>
<p>This time Ranran could see clearly. It was a totem of a Vermilion Bird subduing a demon. With the appearance of the totem, the abdomens of two ghost-headed spiders grasped by the Vermilion Bird on the stone wall showed round holes.</p>
<p>An idea struck, and Ranran quickly took out the purple demon pills she had obtained from killing the ghost-headed spiders earlier. She embedded the two largest pills into the holes.</p>
<p>Upon placing them, everything fit perfectly. The entire totem, with the addition of the demon pills, became radiant, and the two spiders actually started moving. Breaking free from the Vermilion Bird’s claws, they desperately crawled left and right with their spider silk, forcibly splitting open a crack in the stone wall.</p>
<p>As the crack opened, a wave of heat rushed out, and orange-red magma flowed out from the crevice.</p>
<p>Both of them retreated, but Ranran was a bit late, and the magma flowed to her feet…</p>
<p>“Be careful!” Su Yi Shui acted swiftly, immediately picking up the young girl in a horizontal carry and leaped to a higher place, avoiding the scorching magma.</p>
<p>But Ranran exclaimed in surprise, because even though she had touched the magma just now, she didn’t feel any burning sensation on her feet.</p>
<p>She couldn’t help but lift her foot while in Su Yi Shui’s arms and found that the grass shoes on her feet had solidified into ice where they had touched the magma…</p>
<p>The strange situation here temporarily halted the falling out between the master and disciple. Ranran asked Mister Su to set her down, and then she tried touching the magma with the grass shoes on her feet. The shoes immediately turned into ice, completely isolating the heat from below, allowing her to walk on the magma.</p>
<p>Ranran was quite shocked and quickly took out the other pair of grass shoes given to her by the innkeeper from her bag. She carefully inspected them but found nothing unusual.</p>
<p>“Who is that old man? Did he foresee all of this and give me these shoes?” Ranran couldn’t help muttering to herself.</p>
<p>Su Yishui took the pair of shoes from her hands, changed into them quickly, and said, “I’ll go in and take a look. You stay out here and wait.”</p>
<p>Ranran looked at him with mixed feelings. She knew very well that he wasn’t afraid of her going in to snatch the Tempering Flame, but rather, he was afraid of her taking risks.</p>
<p>He had always been like this, although he spoke harshly, he always showed his care for her through actions…</p>
<p>“No, I want to go in with you. This is the north, which is my direction of wealth. There must be surprises and no dangers!” </p>
<p>After saying this, she directly went in by herself.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui thought to himself, <em>Why didn’t I see through her earlier? Although her temperament in this life seems more respectful and gentle than in the past life, her stubbornness and willfully going her own way are exactly the same!</em></p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As they walked into the crack, the others behind them followed the sound of the wall cracking from earlier and found their way there.</p>
<p>When they saw the master and disciple walking on the magma, entering the crevice, Wei Jiu hurriedly flew over, chasing after them towards the crack in the wall.</p>
<p>However, the hot air from inside the crack was overwhelming. Even with his spiritual shield up, he could barely withstand it. When he flew above the magma, there was a gravitational force pulling him down.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu saw the two people walking on the magma and so tried to land, but the heat almost made him roar out his golden core out from his dantian.</p>
<p><em>This was too damned hot!</em></p>
<p>How did those two manage to withstand it? Had their cultivation already become so much higher than his?</p>
<p>Wei Jiu’s feet were too scalded to touch the ground, so he quickly used his energy to leap backward and landed on the ground on his butt. The mighty demonic lord ended up sitting on the ground like a child denied candy, helplessly watching the two enter the crevice…</p>
<p>Even Wei Jiu couldn’t enter, let alone the others. When the magma surged out, they could only step back, and wait for good news from the two who entered.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As for Ranran and Su Yi Shui, wearing ice grass shoes made the magma feel like flat ground. After entering the crevice, they discovered that it was a barrier enveloped by magma.</p>
<p>As they walked in, the magma surged and splattered, and above the magma hung half a skeleton.</p>
<p>The skeleton looked quite eerie. Although it had a human shape, it seemed much larger than an ordinary person, probably over ten meters tall if the person were still alive.</p>
<p>Underneath the skeleton was burning flames, and now the half skeleton only had the sternum and skull left.</p>
<p>As they entered, the brittle sternum suddenly turned into powder, leaving behind a huge golden skull with fiery flames burning in its empty eye sockets, glaring fiercely at the two intruders…</p>
<p>“Is this the skeleton of the Demon King? How many years have passed, and his bones still haven’t been completely refined?” Ranran asked uncertainly.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui mildly said, “The Demon King was the first generation of demons born in the Netherworld, with an indestructible body. That was why, Dun tian sought the true fire from the Heavenly Realm to refine his bones, preventing his rebirth. If it were ordinary true fire, even after ten thousand years, it wouldn’t be able to refine his bones.”</p>
<p>Ranran understood. She frowned and said, “The Demon King’s skeleton is only left with the skull. If we take away the Tempering Flame now, won’t his efforts be in vain?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui nodded slowly.</p>
<p>Ranran suddenly called out in a low voice, “Not good! We’ve opened the forbidden gate. Let’s get out quickly!”</p>
<p>This place had been hidden for tens of thousands of years. Red Flame Mountain has no rain all year round, and the stone walls would have no traces of water, so it shouldn’t have been discovered by anyone.</p>
<p>If some more time passes, the long-refined bones of the demon king will be completely destroyed.</p>
<p>However, with the continuous appearance of demonic creatures all over Da Qi, someone was clearly orchestrating this, leading them step by step to this place.</p>
<p>Including the ghost-headed spiders in the village before, all of them were crucial in opening this stone wall. It just so happened that they were all encountered by her and her master, so their arrival here seemed natural… yet at an inopportune time!</p>
<p>When Ranran realized this, Su Yi Shui had also thought of it. So he pulled Ranran back quickly and prepared to close the stone wall.</p>
<p>But suddenly, a piercing cold wind swept in from the crack in the stone wall, violently pushing the two apart.</p>
<p>Ranran stabilized herself and looked again, but the golden skull had completely disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>Only the originally burning flames, after losing their burning target, began to wither and dissipate continuously, finally turning into a red bead the size of a flint, swirling in midair…</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui used water as a base, wrapping it around the bead, and froze it into an ice bead. The golden flames inside the ice bead were the Tempering Flame they had been looking for.</p>
<p>But there was no joy on Ranran’s face, nor on Su Yishui’s. They knew they had been used, but they didn’t know who had manipulated them.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When the two came out, the elders of Kongsan and Feiyun eagerly asked, “How is it? Did you get the Tempering Flame?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui didn’t speak, but just looked straight at Wei Jiu sitting on the chair brought by his followers.</p>
<p>His trusted lieutenant Tu Jiuyuan was applying medicine to his feet.</p>
<p>This guy loved to show off and very proud. If he had stolen the skull, he would never let himself look like a fool in front of others.</p>
<p>The first person Su Yi Shui ruled out in his mind was Wei Jiu.</p>
<p>At that moment, Ranran channeled a message to him, “Mister Su, don’t mention the matter of the Demon King’s skull to these people.”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui, after hearing this, couldn’t help but calmly swept a glance at Ranran.</p>
<p>As Ranran felt that those present at Red Flame Mountain were not really righteous, she felt that if they mentioned the skull incident, she could even guess what kind of nonsense these people would say with her eyes closed.</p>
<p>It would probably be something like, “As expected of the demon’s son and the demon witch, and now they have colluded to release the first-generation demon.”</p>
<p>After all, in her past life, they had accused her like this, slandering her when she was Mu Qingge, and pushing all the blame to her.</p>
<p>Since that’s the case, one shouldn’t be too honest! The matter of what demonic wind had taken away the skull of the Demon King must be investigated thoroughly, but it must not involve these people.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But Su Yi Shui probably thought the same as she did, so when everyone eagerly asked if he had found the Tempering Flame, he only took out the ice bead and said, “This should be it…”</p>
<p>The eyes of everyone immediately lit up and they surrounded him, but at that moment, numerous disciples of Crimson Gate Sect rushed out from all around the mountain hollow.</p>
<p>The elder of Feiyun Sect sternly hollered, “Wei Jiu, what are you trying to do?”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu sneered, “I’ve said it before, you can search around this Red Flame Mountain as you please. But if you want to find the Tempering Flame and take it away, it depends on whether you have the ability!”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui said loudly, “The item is in my hands, and I have no intention of taking it away. Lord Wei, let’s talk business!”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu chuckled darkly, “What business?”</p>
<p>“You can exchange one person for this Tempering Flame. After that, you can discuss with the elders of other sects how to subdue the demons in the world. What do you think?” </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">冒名顶替 IMPERSONATION</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Of course Wei Jiu knew who Su Yi Shui wanted to exchange for, but he smiled meaningfully and said, “Talking business in the Crimson Gate’s sanctum? It also depends on whether I want to talk to you or not?”</p>
<p>As a person in the demonic path, when you can rob for things like bandits, why bother to conduct business like a decent person?</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui remained calm and composed, just like back when he exchanged the key with Wei Jiu on Jueshan Mountain. He said, “Because I hold the lifeline of your Red Flame Mountain! Right now, the Tempering Flame has just entered a period of temporary weakness. If I fully ignite it, your Red Flame Mountain will instantly become a sea of fire. By then, your hundred-year-old sanctum will be destroyed in an instant, and I’m afraid you won’t have the capital to negotiate with me any more.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, he gently rotated the ice sphere in his hand, and the flames inside suddenly rose in temperature, warming the surrounding air…</p>
<p>Wei Jiu had suffered too many losses at the hands of Su Yi Shui and truly feared him. If he could avoid a fight and obtain the Tempering Flame from him, that would be ideal.</p>
<p>Moreover, even if this true fire was not real, the old drunkard was already of no further use to him.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Wei Jiu sounded him out, “Are you sure you want to make this deal? In my opinion, this is a bad bargain!”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui said coldly, “You also need to think clearly. Once this opportunity is missed, there won’t be another chance. If I change my mind, do you think you can stop me?”</p>
<p>After revealing Ranran’s identity earlier, Su Yi Shui’s reaction was really too calm, showing no signs of the effect of the Soul-Cleansing Charm. However, later when he took Xue Ranran away, he must have questioned her privately.</p>
<p>Thinking of the truth the old drunkard had said to him when he was drunk, Wei Jiu’s smile deepened involuntarily. “Alright, since you are so sincere, if I don’t agree, wouldn’t I be not showing respect for you? The person you want to exchange for is…”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui said, “Hand over the Elder Jiu to me unharmed, and I’ll give you this Tempering Flame”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As soon as he said this, everyone around was shocked and angry.</p>
<p>The elder of the Feiyun Sect, who was considered friendly with the Xishan faction, said solemnly, “Su Yi Shui, you must be careful! Handing over the true fire of tempering to a villain like Wei Jiu is equivalent to handing over the safety of everyone in the world to him, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui said coldly, “Isn’t the safety of the world upheld by you righteous people? I’m just leaving the Tempering Flame at Red Flame Mountain. I believe Lord Wei will also have a good discussion with you all about how to save the world.”</p>
<p>After saying this, curses and accusations erupted from the elders.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu didn’t want these old elders to interfere in his deal. With a wave of his hand, he cast a silencing spell.</p>
<p>This place was his sanctum and also belonged to the fire element, so Wei Jiu’s spiritual force was more powerful here. Although it was just an ordinary silencing spell, it successfully sealed the mouths of all the elders present.</p>
<p>Then Wei Jiu said to Su Yi Shui, “Since it’s our business, we don’t need others to interfere.”</p>
<p>After speaking, Wei Jiu waved his hand to have his disciples separate the elders, and then had someone bring a wine barrel.</p>
<p>Inside the wine barrel was a bearded and unkempt old man, who was none other than the kidnapped Elder Jiu.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu had always suffered losses when dealing with Su Yi Shui before, so he couldn’t let his guard down this time either.</p>
<p>However, Su Yi Shui seemed really eager to leave right away, so there was no need for any further conversation when the exchange was made.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui confirmed the true identity of the old drunk immortal, patted his face, let him say a few drunken words, and then had Yu Chen and the others take Elder Jiu away.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu was afraid that Su Yi Shui might change his mind. Moreover, Su Yi Shui and Ranran were able to enter the hot crevice completely unscathed, so their strength also made him wary. So he didn’t even let his disciples stop them, allowing the Xishan group to leave Red Flame Mountain undeterred.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But when they reached the foot of the mountain, Gao Cang became anxious.</p>
<p>He was a straightforward young man and couldn’t hold back his words, so he asked directly, “Master, by handing over the true fire of tempering to Wei Jiu, aren’t you going to bear a bad reputation?”</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t speak, but she had already guessed the reason why Su Yi Shui had done this. The true fire had been tempering the undying body of the demon king all this time. If it had been fully refined, it wouldn’t matter.</p>
<p>However, the golden skull had disappeared, and the demon king who had been burned for tens of thousands of years, harboring deep resentment. The true fire of tempering would definitely be tainted with this resentment. So, whoever possessed it was actually holding a talisman. If the demon king really managed to return, he would definitely come for the true fire of tempering and vent his hatred wildly.</p>
<p>With this in mind, there was no one more suitable than Wei Jiu to keep it safe. Letting him guard the true fire of tempering and bear the residual resentment of the demon king was like using poison to counter poison. Ranran believed that Lord Wei would be capable of handling this task well.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Ranran even sighed for Wei Jiu, who thought he had made a steal. If he had known that the corpse of the demon king was not completely destroyed, he probably wouldn’t have wanted the Tempering Flame even if they forced it on him.</p>
<p>But such a huge secret couldn’t be revealed to the fellow disciples for now.</p>
<p>Now that they had finally rescued Elder Jiu, it depended on how the old immortal would help Su Yi Shui undo the Soul-Cleansing Talisman and restore all his memories.</p>
<p>Meeting up with Shen Kuo at the foot of the mountain, he was still taking care of his injured junior brother, Yue Sheng. Yue Sheng’s injuries were severe, and at this moment, he was already unconscious, looking barely alive.</p>
<p>Ranran looked down at Yue Sheng’s injured arm, furrowing her brows. She said, ‘Shen Junior Brother, did you forget to change his medicine? It’s been four hours since the medicine for this severed arm was applied, and its effectiveness will weaken. It must be reapplied with new medicine.’</p>
<p>Shen Kuo lowered his head in embarrassment and said, ‘Master and you guys have not come down the mountain all this time, and I was worried, so I forgot to change it. Please punish me, Senior Sister.’</p>
<p>Ranran shook her head. After all, they were all young boys, and it was indeed difficult for them to take care of the patients meticulously. She squatted down and changed the medicine for Yue Sheng.</p>
<p>However, Yue Sheng needed to return to West Mountain as soon as possible and recuperate in a suitable sanctum. It’s just that his severed arm can never be reattached, and it’s uncertain whether his path of cultivation can continue in the future.</p>
<p>When they reached the inn, Ranran couldn’t wait to find the old man who had given her the shoes.</p>
<p>But after searching the inn up and down and asking the waiter, the waiter said they had never had such an old man as Ranran described.</p>
<p>This person seemed to have appeared out of thin air.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As for the priceless treasure Elder Jiu, whom  they had exchanged for a high price, they had no idea how much wine he had been plied with on Red Flame Mountain. He kept sleeping soundly without waking up.</p>
<p>Later, Ranran stuffed a Clear Mind Pill into his mouth, finally waking the old immortal up from his drunken state.</p>
<p>Looking at Ranran clearly, the old drunk immortal still drowsily said, “This alcohol is so strong, I actually dreamed so vividly. Little girl, are you here to brew the Detain-Heaven’s Immortal wine for me again?”</p>
<p>Ranran reached out and pulled his beard, asking, “Does it hurt?”</p>
<p>Seeing Elder Jiu nod obediently, she continued, “So, this is not a dream. We have already rescued you. Do you remember giving Wei Jiu a Soul-Cleansing Charm? Do you know how to undo it?”</p>
<p>When Elder Jiu realized that he was finally rescued, he sat up suddenly, and said guiltily, “I don’t remember anything. Don’t place any blame on me. How could I collude with people like Wei Jiu? But if he got me drunk, then I won’t know anything. In any case, I won’t admit to anything that I don’t remember!”</p>
<p>Back then, Mu Qingge had been framed as a scourge of evil and was eventually besieged before her vitality recovered.</p>
<p>Elder Jiu was too attached to the secular world, so he adamantly denied that he had “helped” people in the demonic path.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t know to laugh or cry, and said, “I’m not like those people from Jiuhua. I won’t blame you for anything! If you don’t remember, that’s fine. I just want to know how to undo the Soul-Cleansing Talisman?”</p>
<p>Elder Jiu gathered his thoughts and asked urgently, “Girl, are you under the Soul-Cleansing talisman? Did you forget the brewing method of the Detain-Heaven’s Immortal wine, or did you forget other important things?”</p>
<p>When Elder Jiu learnt that it was Su Yi Shui who was under the effects of it, he breathed a sigh of relief. “So it was him. Then there’s no problem. Someone heartless like him, forgetting love is not a big deal.”</p>
<p>Ranran was upset and said sharply, “How is it not a big deal? He’s forgotten every single thing about me and even thought I had ulterior motives!”</p>
<p>Elder Jiu looked at Su Yi Shui, who happened to be standing outside the half-open door. He seemed to have heard Ranran’s low shout just now, and his body stiffened slightly.</p>
<p>At that moment, Ranran suddenly remembered the temperament of Elder Jiu and immediately said softly, “If you undo the charm for him, I’ll brew you some good wine and prepare some snacks to go with it. How about that?”</p>
<p>Elder Jiu had a longing look but then shook his head regretfully, “It’s a pity. There is no spiritual talisman to undo the Soul-Cleansing talisman. Otherwise, I could have had a few more good drinks…”</p>
<p>Ranran was shocked to hear this. “What? You say there’s no way to undo it… How is that possible?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui also frowned slightly at the door, finally understanding the meaning of Wei Jiu’s words when he said, “Don’t regret it.” </p>
<p>Wei Jiu had probably asked Elder Jiu about the possibility of undoing the charm long ago and only made the exchange after knowing it couldn’t be undone.</p>
<p>Well, these two archenemies can be considered as having schemed against each other, barely ending up in a tie!</p>
<p>Ranran suddenly felt empty inside. She silently turned around, and prepared to leave the room.</p>
<p>She did not expect to see Su Yi Shui standing at the door, and did not know how long he had been there.</p>
<p>As their eyes met, the thought that Su Yi Shui could no longer remember the past, made her feel as if half of her heart had been cut off. She lowered her head and ran past him towards the backyard.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui tried hard to control himself, but he still moved to chase after her.</p>
<p>Elder Jiu watched their backs and muttered to himself, “I just said there’s no spiritual talisman to undo it, not that there’s no way to undo it. Why did those two leave without hearing everything?”</p>
<p>But that method was difficult in the first place, not something that could be easily changed by human efforts. Elder Jiu thought it was better not to say anything. Considering the suffering he had endured these past days, he had no mood to meddle in the love affairs of those young boys and girls. He stretched comfortably and then fell asleep soundly on the soft bed…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, after Su Yi Shui had followed her, he saw Ranran sitting under the locust tree in a daze.</p>
<p>Since the Tempering Flame had been sealed, the temperature around Red Flame Mountain had dropped significantly. </p>
<p>In fact, near dusk, thunder roared, and heavy rain that had not been seen for the longest time, began to pour. Standing under the tree, the girl who was looking up had raindrops on her face, and one couldn’t tell if she had cried sadly just now.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui silently used his power to create a spiritual shield, isolating the heavy rain and enveloping the despondent girl within. He asked in a low voice, “What are you thinking?”</p>
<p>Ranran snapped out of her thoughts, looked regretfully at the bald branches, and murmured, “It’s raining… how nice. When spring comes next year and the tree blooms, locust tree flower dumplings with lamb filling will be so delicious. But its too bad… you probably don’t remember that taste…”</p>
<p>In the spring of this year, she had made dumplings with locust tree flowers filling for her master.</p>
<p>At that time, he had accompanied her on the mountain, under the pretext of practicing light body techniques, watching her jump around picking flowers all over the mountains.</p>
<p>The sunlight was gentle, the man in white was elegant, stretching his arms gracefully with wide sleeves, playing a melodious ancient qin in the gentle breeze and rain of flowers. She had leaped about with the rhythm, and picked a basket full of flowers.</p>
<p>So much so that for a long time afterward, every time she heard Shifu play the same tune, her nose would seem to be filled with the fragrance of locust flowers…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Su Yi Shui knew, that the news that his Soul-Cleansing Charm could not be undone seemed to have hit Ranran very hard.</p>
<p>In fact, he was also very curious about what kind of feelings he had developed for this reincarnated Mu Qingge. The Soul-Cleansing Charm washes away the deep love that’s engraved in the bone marrow. How could he have fallen for Mu Qingge – that demoness who had treated him as a plaything!</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui actually had loads of malicious words to say, but when he saw Ranran’s despondent look, those words dissipated on the tip of his tongue.</p>
<p>He frowned and said, “We’ve only met for two years in this life. Even if I don’t remember the past, you can tell me everything one by one… But remember one thing, don’t embellish or make up inexplicable things!”</p>
<p>He remembered Mu Qingge’s naughty and mischievous nature, always seizing every opportunity to tease people. If he let her speak unchecked, she might add in some absurd scenes.</p>
<p>Ranran wiped the raindrops off her face and suddenly chuckled bitterly, “What are ‘made-up things’? Like… you always sneakily kissed me when no one else is around, is that absurd enough?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui was annoyed by her brazen words and frowned, “Do you even need to ask? Such absurd talk, you first need someone to believe it! Alright, you’re lacking true qi right now. If you stay drenched in the rain like this, you’ll likely catch a chill. Hurry back to the room and warm yourself by the fire…”</p>
<p>With that, he took Ranran’s hand and walked towards the house.</p>
<p>If Xue Ranran said she hadn’t regained her memories from her past life, he would believe her for now.</p>
<p>From what he could see, the seemingly innocent young girl had not inherited Mu Qingge’s playful and careless behavior from her past life.</p>
<p>Since Xue Ranran was his disciple, he naturally had to teach her well. If she really became like her past self again, he would naturally deal with it sternly and wouldn’t tolerate it!</p>
<p>But for now, he just wanted her to dry off quickly and cheer up, and stop looking so depressed.</p>
<p><em>Right, he had asked Yu Chen to heat up some bath water earlier, so now would be a good time for Ranran to take a bath first…</em></p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Just as they reached the entrance of the inn, they happened to see Elder Jiu standing there. He burped and said, “Why did you leave so quickly earlier? I hadn’t finished talking yet!”</p>
<p>Ranran replied listlessly, “Elder Jiu, you shouldn’t drink for now. The alcohol that the Crimson Gate people gave you was extremely strong liquor, very harmful to your body. Even if you really become an immortal, drinking like this will ruin your digestive system!”</p>
<p>Elder Jiu pointed to the door to the bath and said, “What I meant was, although the Soul-Cleansing Charm can’t be undone with a spiritual charm, it actually blocks the emotional connection. If combined with a secret medicine made from gold, it can alleviate it slightly. I’ve already prepared the water. Let your master soak in it later and see if it works…”</p>
<p>With that, he burped again and turned to walk back to his room.</p>
<p>Ranran lifted the door curtain and indeed saw water in the bathtub inside, floating with golden powder and emitting a pleasant fragrance.</p>
<p>A glimmer of hope appeared on Ranran’s face as she looked towards Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui thought for a moment and said, “You should go back to your room first.”</p>
<p>Since the water had been infused with a secret medicine made from gold and stones, Ranran couldn’t soak in it anymore. So he asked her to return to her room first.</p>
<p>If Su Yi Shui wanted to take a bath, it wouldn’t be appropriate for her to be around either.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran went back to her room and changed her clothes. She couldn’t help herself and went to look for Elder Jiu again. This person was always muddled and unreliable when he drank. How could he come up with the medicine immediately after waking up? She had to clarify with him before she could be at ease. However, when she reached Elder Jiu’s room, he was already in a deep sleep.</p>
<p>Ranran took out her personal wine gourd, which had the last bit of the twenty-year-old Detain-Heaven’s immortal wine.</p>
<p>As soon as the wine cork was opened, the aroma of the wine was more effective than any hangover remedy. Elder Jiu hadn’t even finished his snore before he immediately opened his eyes and woke up.</p>
<p>“Little girl, you actually have such a private stash. Hurry up and satisfy my craving.”</p>
<p>Thinking that her master might be able to undo the Soul-Cleansing Charm, Ranran’s heart also relaxed a little. She said with a wry smile, “I met your brother who had already ascended, the Medicine Immortal, on Tianmai Mountain. Although you two look exactly alike, your temperaments and personalities are like night and day… I wonder how your ability to prepare medicine compares to your brother’s, and if there are any other side effects to this medicine?”</p>
<p>Elder Jiu put down the wine jug, burped, and in a drunken haze said, “My brother and I are as different as night and day, one is ugly and one is handsome. I look like our father, he looks like our mother. How can you say we look exactly alike? Did he become ugly after ascending to immortality, so he also became a square-shaped wine barrel?”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Ranran’s smile froze, and she grabbed the wine pouch from Elder Jiu, and exclaimed, “What did you say? You and your brother don’t look alike at all?”</p>
<p>Elder Jiu seemed startled by her reaction, nodded honestly, and then chuckled, “Many people hear our names and think that because we’re twins, we would look exactly alike… Hahaha, my brother is quite handsome, not inferior to that pasty-faced Su Yi Shui!”</p>
<p>But at that moment, Ranran felt that her blood was about to freeze.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t the Medicine Immortal that she encountered on Tianmai Mountain, then… who was that person?</p>
<p>Thinking of the person who deliberately disguised himself as Medicine Immortal, leading her into the pool, Ranran felt a chill run down her spine. She stood up suddenly, picked up a tea cup, splashed water on Elder Jiu, and asked, “Did you give my Shifu the medicated water to undo the Soul-Cleansing Charm just now?”</p>
<p>Elder Jiu was startled by the splash and momentarily forgot to get angry. He was also somewhat sobered by Ranran’s intense gaze and honestly replied, “What medicine? How can medicine undo the Soul-Cleansing Charm? I’ve been sleeping all this time, how could I have given bathwater to that Su?”</p>
<p>Ranran ran quickly towards the inn’s bathhouse.</p>
<p>When she burst into the bathhouse, Su Yi Shui had already taken off his garment, revealing an enchanting waistline, with a towel around his narrow waist. He was standing, staring blankly at the tub full of golden water.</p>
<p>It’s unclear what he was hesitating about, but fortunately, he hesitated long enough for Ranran to stop him.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran leaped forward and hugged Su Yi Shui in an instant .</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui raised an eyebrow at the girl who was holding onto him fiercely, and when Gao Cang and Shen Kuo entered the bath, they were dumbfounded by this scene.</p>
<p>Ranran had exerted all her strength when she came rushing over. She was now near collapse, as she leaned weakly on Su Yi Shui’s firm chest, and whispered, “The medicated water is a ruse, don’t enter it…”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui noticed her pale and frail face and immediately sensed her weakening vitality. He quickly carried her in his arms and returned to the bedroom to help regulate her qi.</p>
<p>After she had recovered somewhat, Ranran told Su Yi Shui what Elder Jiu had said. Su Yi Shui immediately understood that someone had impersonated the old man and used the time gap to give him the “prescription” before the real Elder Jiu woke up.</p>
<p>When Su Yishui took Elder Jiu to check the tub of golden water, the water had already been drained out through a pipe.</p>
<p>When they asked Gao Cang and Shen Kuo who were supposed to be watching the bath, they were also puzzled. They said they had both been guarding outside the master’s bedroom and hadn’t come back to the bath, so they didn’t know who drained the water.</p>
<p>But Ranran still felt a shiver in her heart. She whispered, “The person who impersonated Elder Jiu has appeared before us more than once…”</p>
<p>Back on Tianmai Mountain, the Medicine Immortal had given off a unique herbal scent. Later, when they entered the Netherworld Realm, they had encountered a blind shepherd with a similar scent on him.</p>
<p>Since he was disabled, taking medicine regularly was not out of the ordinary. In addition, at that time, Ranran’s attention was drawn to the strange flower sea, so she didn’t think much about it.</p>
<p>But later, when they were preparing to go to Red Flame Mountain, the old innkeeper who gifted her the grass shoes had also smelled of the same herbal scent.</p>
<p>Now thinking back carefully, Ranran was confident in her keen sense of smell. These three people were clearly the same person!</p>
<p>Thinking that someone had been following their every move, even guiding their actions, Ranran couldn’t help but shudder.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After her vitality qi had stabilized, she turned to Su Yi Shui and asked, “Shifu, you didn’t enter the tub just now. What were you thinking about?”</p>
<p>Of course, Su Yi Shui wouldn’t tell her that he was thinking about Ranran’s absurd words.</p>
<p><em>He would look for places with no one around to kiss her? Was he an old village bachelor who couldn’t find a wife? To think he would actually do such a preposterous thing?</em></p>
<p>But then he remembered how serious Ranran looked when she said those words. What if it was true… Su Yi Shui felt like he wanted to strangle that person who did such things.</p>
<p><em>But that girl’s lips seemed like they have been tinted by cherry blossoms, looking so soft, what would it feel like to actually kiss them?</em></p>
<p>As he thought about it, Su Yi Shui suddenly felt his cheeks grow hot. He was momentarily lost in thought, and when he came back to his senses, he saw the girl fiercely pounce over, hugging him tightly…</p>
<p>Although the golden water had been drained, there were still some traces left.</p>
<p>Elder Jiu carefully inspected it, frowning as he said, “This… it’s the gold pupa powder used by powerful experts to make evil talismans. If this powder has been boosted, it’s an excellent catalyst for possession. Someone deliberately wanted Su Yi Shui to soak in this water, is… trying to possess him?”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>
<p>We will get to see Su Yi Shui’s enchanting waistline in the drama right? <em>haha</em></p>
<p>* again I think the author got confused with the setup… earlier it said its a bath tub of water, but it later turned into a 池 pool – since its unlikely to be a pool I will revert to it being a tub of water which is more logical…How much gold powder would the imposter require to fill an entire bath pool right? Seems like it would weaken the effect of the soak as well..</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">西山除名   EXPELLED FROM XISHAN</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p><br/>This statement was met with solemn expressions from everyone, especially Su Yi Shui and Xue Ranran. They both thought of the skull of the demon king that had not been completely destroyed.</p>
<p>All along, there had been a hidden hand manipulating everything behind the scenes, silently guiding them into the Netherworld Realm and then finding the remains of the demon king.</p>
<p>Although the person guiding them so far seemed to have not shown too much malice, the feeling of being manipulated and played in the palm of someone else’s hand was extremely uncomfortable!</p>
<p>Who could that person be, who keeps impersonating others, disguising as the Medicine Immortal, an unknown elder, and even as the innkeeper?</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui said immediately, “We leave at night, and depart right now from the territory of the Red Flame Mountain!”</p>
<p>This place was too close to Wei Jiu’s territory, so it was indeed not suitable to stay for long. Moreover, the identity of the hidden manipulator was unknown, and they could transform into different forms, making it difficult to be detected. Therefore, they needed to return to their own sanctum as soon as possible to be able to set up a proper defense.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Of course, on their way back, they also heard some updates from the Red Flame Mountain.</p>
<p>After Wei Jiu obtained the Tempering Flame, he easily brought the elders of those sects under his control.</p>
<p>It was said that Emperor Su Yu also sent people to commend Wei Jiu for his painstaking efforts in obtaining the Flame for the sake of the masses, showing an intention to restore the Crimson Gate sect to good standing.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu had saved him before, which deserved some royal favor. This time, the extraordinary talents sent by Su Yu were nearly entirely annihilated, and now that demons were constantly emerging, Su Yu urgently needed powerful individuals to help him suppress the chaos. Naturally, he had to flatter Wei Jiu, the Demon Lord.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Su Yu had always been wary of the prestige of those righteous orthodox sects, fearing that they might overthrow his reign. If he could elevate the Crimson Gate through this opportunity, it would be a good counterbalance against those three declining major sects.</p>
<p>Now, Wei Jiu had already led the Crimson Gate sect out of the mountain and renamed the Tempering Flame to the Crimson Gate Sacred Fire. They were subduing and destroying demons along the way and gaining significant prestige.</p>
<p>Perhaps it won’t be long for Wei Jiu to become the new highly sought-after Imperial advisor of his generation, after the War Goddess, Mu Qingge.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As for Elder Jiu, he couldn’t return to Cuiwei Mountain at this time, and had to return to Xishan with them.</p>
<p>When he was almost sober, he finally explained everything clearly. Although the Soul-Cleansing Talisman could not be undone by another spiritual talisman, if the person affected by the charm fell deeply in love again with the person they have forgotten, the effect of the spiritual talisman would be automatically lifted.</p>
<p>After saying this, Elder Jiu also did his best to elaborate, “This deep love, means being together in life or in death, to be willing to die for the other. If Ranran encounters any danger next time, just use your chest to block the sword for her. If you are fortunate enough to survive, your memories will fully recover!”</p>
<p>Listening to this, Su Yi Shui’s face turned very frosty. He couldn’t even accept the possibility of having loved Mu Qingge before, so how could he fall deeply in love again? And he would even have to die for her by blocking a blade?</p>
<p><em>It’s really truly, utterly, ridiculous!</em></p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Xue Ranran also smiled wryly as she listened.</p>
<p>She felt that Su Yi Shui might have really loved Mu Qingge in her past life. This kind of love that could sacrifice half of one’s cultivation was undeniable.</p>
<p>But she was not Mu Qingge. She was just a fruit that fell from the Rebirth Tree, with her own skin and flesh as Xue Ranran.</p>
<p>Because of the memories and longing owing to the separation of life and death, in seeking solace, Su Yi Shui may have transferred his affections to her, and loved Xue Ranran.</p>
<p>And hence, there was his indulgence after being influenced by the Spirit Spring. Those memories had been sweet and beautiful, but were now bitter and sour to recall.</p>
<p>Now that Su Yi Shui lacked the deeply etched memories of Mu Qingge, Xue Ranran would mean nothing to him. </p>
<p>She couldn’t even be like those silly maidens in books, to confront and question whether the fickle person had ever loved her.</p>
<p>A man who now remembers nothing, explicitly informed her of the depth of his love, completely removing the ambiguous unease in guessing the degree of affection. It was almost too honest to look directly upon.</p>
<p>After hearing Elder Jiu’s words, Ranran again found a quiet hillside alone, gazing silently at the moon in the treetops to dispel her anguish.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Not too long later, someone sat down beside her. The man’s cold voice said, “You’ve also heard the solution. If you really want me to remember, be more proactive. Do exactly what you did to beguile me back then.”</p>
<p>Hearing the homework set by her former beloved disciple, the former Master of Xishan found it difficult to sustain her melancholy. She turned her head in surprise and asked softly, “Are you… implying that I seduced you?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui didn’t think he was being unreasonable, merely stating calmly, “Isn’t that so? In your past life, you have always liked good-looking young men, able to win hearts with just a few words. Although I’m not that kind of weak-minded person, I can’t say for certain that you didn’t use some extraordinary means to bewitch me when I was young and naive back then. Since it’s like this, just do it again one more time.”</p>
<p>Ranran was dumbfounded. Thinking carefully, in <em>her</em> memories, Shifu was the one who used his outstanding looks to bewitch her when she was young and naive! </p>
<p>As far as she could tell, there was indeed a fox spirit here, but unfortunately, it was a male fox spirit!</p>
<p>So she bluntly said, “Shifu, I can swear a soul oath that I have never tried to seduce you! Besides, you said the Soul Cleansing Talisman doesn’t bother you much, so… why don’t we just forget about it?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui felt that he had made a significant concession by coming over. But unexpectedly, this little demoness didn’t appreciate it and even hinted in her words that he was the one who was desperately clinging onto and deeply infatuated with Mu Qingge!</p>
<p>Could it be that he had actively pursued Mu Qingge back then? Su Yi Shui became angry. Anyone with a brain couldn’t write such an absurd scenario!</p>
<p>“Xue Ranran, don’t push your luck! Is it really that proud to make the effort to claim about having a leg-up about this kind of matters?”</p>
<p>With the conversation reaching this point, the deep bond between master and disciple was about to be temporarily set aside.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran rolled up her sleeves, preparing to have a serious analysis with Su Yi Shui, “No… let’s not talk about the present. Let’s just talk about Mu Qingge in her past life. Shifu, you should have heard from second uncle master that Emperor Su Yu built such a splendid residence in Xishan just to win a smile from Mu Qingge. And the Demon Lord Wei Jiu was also awkwardly trying to win her favor. At that time, Shifu, apart from being more good-looking, you didn’t seem to have any advantages! Although I don’t remember my past life, I can imagine being surrounded by so many handsome young men… If you didn’t put in more effort at that time, you probably wouldn’t have stood a chance…”</p>
<p>When she reached the end of her analysis, Ranran’s voice trailed into a lower pitch instinctively under Su Yi Shui’s sharp gaze.</p>
<p>“Why? Are you very proud of bewitching so many men in your past life?”</p>
<p>Ranran was somewhat speechless at being cornered “I… I mean, it’s my past life, it has nothing to do with who I am now… Even if I get married, I will have to wait for my mother to arrange it for me…”</p>
<p>Due to the issue of who seduced whom in the past, their moonlit heart-to-heart conversation ended on a sour note.</p>
<p>For the next few days, the two of them remained silent, not speaking to each other.</p>
<p>Even Elder Jiu could see that they were having a tiff, and he chuckled, “See, the Soul-Cleansing Talisman is also a touchstone talisman. No matter how deep the love, it’s just each taking what they need. If you easily forget and part ways, it’s also good!”</p>
<p>After hearing his words, Su Yi Shui glanced at the old man, then gestured with his long finger and spilled the wine that Ranran had brought for Elder Jiu onto the roots of a tree.</p>
<p>This made Elder Jiu jump in anger, cursing Su Yi Shui for being despicable!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After their fierce battle on Red Flame Mountain, everyone was somewhat worn out. When they left the territory of Crimson Gate, Su Yi Shui instructed Yuchen and the others to buy a carriage to transport Yue Sheng.</p>
<p>Ranran also had them change their clothes and shoes and wash them by the stream.</p>
<p>While washing the clothes, Qiu Xier saw Ranran staring blankly at the shoes in her hand, seemingly lost in thought. She couldn’t help but nudge her and then signaled with her eyes that their master was looking sideways at her from the other side of the stream.</p>
<p>Considering that the two of them hadn’t spoken or interacted for several days, Su Yi Shui’s face became increasingly sullen, frightening the uncle masters and fellow disciples not to even breathe loudly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the usually sweet-talking Ranran seemed to have lost her wit this time and didn’t try to cheer their master up.</p>
<p>If this awkwardness continued, perhaps Xishan would really witness a tragic drama of killing a disciple to right a wrong.</p>
<p>Feeling that she had perhaps gone a little too far these past few days, Ranran slowly put down the shoes and then lightly jumped over the stream, coming to Su Yi Shui’s side.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier couldn’t help but look at the two of them with a subtle atmosphere, sweating for Ranran.</p>
<p>But the two of them didn’t speak, just slightly moved their throats for a while before going to a nearby grove of trees one after the other.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier, seeing their throats move, also guessed that they were using voice channeling to communicate, and others couldn’t hear what they were saying.</p>
<p>She sighed, “What should we do? Junior sister has suddenly become our demonic Grandmaster. Will Master bully his Master?”</p>
<p>Gao Cang, who was helping her make *soap nearby, felt like Xier’s words were like a tongue twister and said foolishly, “Junior sister is so adorable, how could Master bear to scold her?”<br/>*猪油胰子 is 肥皂</p>
<p>Before too long, Su Yi Shui and Ranran came out of the woods.</p>
<p>Perhaps because they had cleared up the misunderstanding, the impasse between the two seemed to have eased a little after that day.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Finally, two days later, Yue Sheng has regained consciousness. Ranran asked Shen Kuo and Qiu Xier to fetch some clean water from the stream.</p>
<p>Then she changed Yue Sheng’s bandages while casually asking, “When we went up Red Flame Mountain, junior brother Shen Kuo stayed by your side all the time, didn’t he?”</p>
<p>Yue Sheng struggled to remember. “My wound was too painful at the time. Shen Kuo said he had some calming pills, and after I took them, I fell asleep. When I woke up, it was when Master and you all came back… My life is completely over now… You shouldn’t have saved me, it would have been better if I died then!”</p>
<p>Ranran glanced at him. “If you really had a death wish, when we faced the Five Fiends Formation, you wouldn’t have abandoned us and rushed to leave with Old Feng, the person with Yin-Yang Eyes. If entering the formation was a gamble, you should be willing to accept the consequences. You were lucky to come out alive; you can’t blame us for saving you and then giving up on yourself!”</p>
<p>If the former arrogant Yue Sheng had heard this, he would have stomped his feet in protest by now. But now, hearing this, he felt ashamed.</p>
<p>If he had trusted Master and followed them into the most dangerous North Gate, he probably wouldn’t have ended up like this? Thinking of this, the young man looked at his severed arm and burst into tears, whispering, “Senior sister, I’m disfigured now and disabled. Will you… not like me anymore?”</p>
<p>Hmm… Ranran helplessly shook her head. “Even if you weren’t disfigured, I still wouldn’t like you. When we get back, I’ll ask Fourteen uncle master to make you a well crafted prosthetic limb. Maybe it can help with basic daily activities. Cultivation is about transcending the physical body in the first place. If your body was meant to be discarded, why care about its condition? As long as you’re alive, even left with only one aspiring breath, you can still maintain your dignity! If you see fourteen uncle master with his disabled hands, you’ll know that it doesn’t matter being physically disabled. If your spirit is disabled, that’s truly beyond remedy!”</p>
<p>Ranran’s tone was always gentle, but her words were firm. Hearing this, the despondent and dejected Yue Sheng felt a lot more at ease in his heart.</p>
<p>The next day when they were about to set off, Yue Sheng, who had been lying half-dead in the carriage, even got up and tried to help Qiu Xier and the others with their tasks using his other hand.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Actually, along the way back, Yutong had been on edge. She and her brother’s gazes always unconsciously scrutinized Xue Ranran.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, there was that feeling of awakening from a dream, wondering how she had been so blind before.</p>
<p>Although Xue Ranran seemed to have undergone significant changes in appearance compared to her past life, her gaze was very much the same.</p>
<p>And that calm and composed demeanor was also exactly the same, and her persuasive eloquence has been inherited completely.</p>
<p>Especially when she lazily lay down, eating snacks on a big rock! She was plainly Mu Qingge herself!</p>
<p>Yutong didn’t talk to Ranran any more now. She was not deliberately ignoring her, but really more not knowing what to say.</p>
<p>Only those involved in the situation knew the subtlety. Ranran felt that she really shouldn’t return to Xishan anymore.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>So, when the group returned to Xishan, during a break in their cultivation exercises, Ranran tactfully expressed her thoughts to Su Yi Shui. If he agreed, she wanted to go back to spend the last bit of time she had left with her parents.</p>
<p>They didn’t have any children of their own, just this one adopted child, so she wanted to accompany them properly.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui listened to her farewell, which sounded like her last words, and felt unhappy deep down.</p>
<p>He didn’t even look at the young girl standing by the bookcase. As he tidied the bookshelf, he said, “Since you are Mu Qingge, I naturally can’t have you as my disciple anymore. From this day forth, you are expelled from Xishan.”</p>
<p>Ranran had only wanted to bid farewell and cherish the time she had left, but she didn’t expect Su Yi Shui to be so unfeeling and actually expel her from Xishan!</p>
<p>In other words, in the time Su Yi Shui had started to accept disciples, the first one he would expel was actually her, Xue Ranran!</p>
<p>Hearing this, Ranran quickly glanced at Su Yi Shui and said, “I don’t have long left. What’s the harm to let me be associated with the name of Xishan? Must you expel me…”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui vigorously dusted the non-existent dust on the bookshelf with a chicken feather duster. He said coldly, “Since you are already so detached about life and death, why care about being linked to the reputation of Xishan?”</p>
<p>Ranran felt that what Su Yi Shui said made sense. For someone who was going to die soon, there was indeed no need to care about the stigma of being a traitor to Xishan… Strictly speaking, she must be the only grandmaster ever to be driven out of the sect by her former disciple in the entire world.</p>
<p>She sighed softly, then turned around intending to go pack her luggage. But Su Yi Shui turned around and asked, “Where are you going?”</p>
<p>Ranran muttered, “Since I’m no longer a disciple of Xishan, how can I continue eating your food? I’ll pack my things and leave right away.”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui sat back on his chair. “Where are you planning to go?”</p>
<p>Ranran looked out the window and said, “Naturally I’m going to find my parents. The taste of glutinous rice in Jiangnan is best at this time, making steamed cakes is very delicious. I will get a boat and travel along the Nan River, shop during the day, and stay overnight on the boat…”</p>
<p>She had sure thought it out thoroughly. This kind of journey filled with shopping and eating sounded beautiful just thinking about it.</p>
<p>It’s ironic that she had encouraged Yue Sheng to pull himself together the other day, but when it came to herself, she was so dispirited, only thinking about seeking death?</p>
<p>He didn’t say anything more, just coldly told her to leave the room.</p>
<p>The argument between the two could be heard from the study, causing the disciples in the martial grounds to look at each other and glance over there frequently.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran lifted her head to look at the man with frosty expression… After this parting, they probably won’t see each other again in the future.</p>
<p>It’s not that she was in despair and seeking death, but her body was like a bottomless pit, truly a burden to him.</p>
<p>Now that someone was plotting something devious behind the scenes. If Su Yi Shui didn’t make adequate preparations, he might be dragged down by her.</p>
<p>So Ranran felt that leaving was the best choice. It seemed that he now understood this as well. Also since knowing that she was Mu Qingge, he probably felt thoroughly disgusted in his heart.</p>
<p>By expelling her like this instead of taking back the cultivation of his golden core, it could be considered as fulfilling their bond between master and disciple of two lifetimes…</p>
<p>Since realizing that all of this was the best choice, Xue Ranran didn’t hesitate when she packed up her things.</p>
<p>However, when she returned to the courtyard, she found that the Rebirth Tree in her courtyard had been dug up.</p>
<p>After asking Qiu Xier, she learned that it was Shifu who had senior uncle master dig it up. As for where it was transplanted to, Qiu Xier didn’t know either.</p>
<p>Without this tree, Ranran’s body would be even more difficult to sustain.</p>
<p>But this tree belonged to Su Yi Shui. If he didn’t want to give it, she couldn’t ask for it. Fortunately, there were still two portions of roots in her room, which should barely be enough to support her to return to see her parents…</p>
<p>So, after packing her luggage, Ranran left a farewell letter to her senior brothers and sisters and left.</p>
<p>When she was leaving, Su Yi Shui announced that he was entering seclusion, and spiritual shields were placed on the mountaintop. Even Yutong couldn’t get close, so there was no further need to bid farewell to Shifu.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t want to go through the whole process of a dramatic farewell, so she quietly left by herself.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But when she left the Xishan Mountain Gate, someone behind her called out, “Senior sister, please wait!”</p>
<p>Ranran turned around and saw junior Shen Kuo who had followed her down the mountain without her knowing: “Senior sister, why are you leaving with your luggage?”</p>
<p>Ranran smiled faintly, “Yesterday at dinner, didn’t second uncle master passed down Shifu’s instructions and announced that I was expelled from Xishan? I’m no longer a disciple of Xishan, so naturally, I have to go back to my parents.”</p>
<p>Shen Kuo’s face showed a look of sadness. “I heard third senior sister mention about the grievances between you and Master, but maybe Master was just angry for a moment. He didn’t say he wanted to drive you off the mountain. Your vitality is really unstable now. What are we going to do if you  leave by yourself and encounter danger? No, even if you insist on leaving, I must escort you. I won’t let you go alone.”</p>
<p>Ranran looked at the sincerity on Shen Kuo’s fair face, considered for a moment, then said hesitatingly, “If you insist, then let’s go together. This would be just right. I was going to ask Uncle master Zeng yi to make a prosthetic limb for junior brother Yue Sheng, so you can bring it back then.”</p>
<p>After reaching an agreement with her former junior brother, Shen Kuo didn’t even go back to the sect and directly left with Ranran.</p>
<p>In his words, his light body technique had already reached a high level, so even with two trips to go forth and back, it wouldn’t take too long. With Master in seclusion and no one supervising them, it was just right for him to escort senior sister back home.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The journey went relatively smoothly. Ranran couldn’t afford to casually expend true qi now, so Shen Kuo hired a carriage at the foot of the mountain to take her.</p>
<p>Sitting in the carriage, since they had nothing else to do, Ranran chatted with Shen Kuo, “Did you grow up on Red Flame Mountain when you were young?”</p>
<p>Shen Kuo shook his head. He was the descendant of the former Crimson Gate Leader. When the old master had been killed by Wei Jiu, he hadn’t been born yet, so he had never stayed on Red Flame Mountain.</p>
<p>Ranran hummed a song for a while, then suddenly said, “Since you’ve never been to Red Flame Mountain and are not familiar with the terrain there, how did you manage to go up and down the mountain in less than an hour?”</p>
<p>Shen Kuo was puzzled by the question, “Fourth senior sister, what are you talking about? Why don’t I understand?”</p>
<p>Ranran looked at him and said, “Do you remember when I brought everyone’s clothes and shoes to wash at the creek? I found something interesting. The soles of the shoes of senior brother and the others were stained with the unique red clay from the top of Red Flame Mountain, which was very difficult to wash. But junior Yue Sheng, who didn’t go up the mountain, had clean shoes. However, you… who were supposedly taking care of junior Yue down the mountain, your shoes also had red clay. Junior brother, can you explain to me what happened?”</p>
<p>Shen Kuo was at a loss for a moment. Then his face filled with shame as he said, “Senior sister, I was wrong. I indeed didn’t take good care of junior brother. At that time, he had fallen asleep. I was bored and also worried about you all. So I left Yue Sheng one time to investigate, but I got lost up there and came back down. I know it was wrong to leave him alone by himself. I won’t dare to do it again in the future.”</p>
<p>Ranran shook her head. “You weren’t bored; you were scheming carefully. That’s why you gave Yue Sheng a sleeping pill, deliberately creating an alibi and going up the Red Flame Mountain. I asked Yue Sheng, and he said he fell asleep when the sun was high, exactly when Shifu and I accidentally went in the crevice. When you secretly went up the mountain at that time, what were you planning to do? And the tub of enhanced golden water, you also secretly drained it, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>Shen Kuo chuckled lowly, his usually shy and reserved demeanor now tainted with a sinister aura.</p>
<p>“Fourth senior sister, you’re really wasting your talents not becoming a magistrate for criminal cases. Just an oversight on the soles of shoes have led you to so many conclusions. Yes, I did sneak up the mountain. After all, welcoming the bones of the Demon King is an important event. To take it away under the noses of everyone on Red Flame Mountain requires some effort. As for that golden water… if it weren’t for your meddling, our grand plan would have been accomplished by now, and why would I need to waste time talking to you here?”</p>
<p>Ranran stood upright now, looking at him warily. “Who exactly are you?”</p>

<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Shen Kuo burst into laughter. “Of course, I am Shen Kuo. If this identity were fake, how could I fool someone so cunning like Su Yi Shui? He wants to use me? Well, I am also using him, aren’t I?”</p>
<p>Ranran stared at him. “What is your connection with the Fan Tian Sect?”</p>
<p>Shen Kuo gave her a thumbs up. “You even figured that out?”</p>
<p>Ranran was just trying to bluff, but she didn’t expect Shen Kuo to admit to it so readily.</p>
<p>She had previously asked Elder Jiu about the sinister skills used by those who had abducted him from Cuiwei Mountain, which seemed similar to the exterminated Fan Tian Sect.</p>
<p>And since then, the Fan Tian Sect had reappeared now and then, with intricate connections to the Demon King.</p>
<p>Shen Kuo’s careful plotting to obtain the skull, made his connection to the Fan Tian Sect seem evident.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>They had traveled far from West Mountain, leaving towns behind, and reached a remote area with no passersby. Shen Kuo felt that since Ranran had discovered him, there was no need to hide anymore, he might as well reveal his intentions and just kidnap her.</p>
<p>Even if Xue Ranran didn’t speak up, Shen Kuo had already planned to move and take action after they have gone on a little further. Now that she had seen through him, it was still just going ahead with his original plan.</p>
<p>“I am indeed Shen Kuo, but also the Protector Elder of the Fan Tian Sect. Xue Ranran… no, I should call you Mu Qingge. You are also essential to the revival of our Fan Tian Sect. How about it? Since Xishan doesn’t want you, why not come with me?”</p>
<p>His family had fallen, suppressed by Wei Jiu, and if he hadn’t joined the Fan Tian Sect by chance, he would have been hunted down and killed by Wei Jiu’s disciples long ago.</p>
<p>Now, only by reviving the Fan Tian Sect could he return to Red Flame Mountain and exact revenge on Wei Jiu.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran chuckled. “I didn’t expect Xishan to have such talents, even a prominent Elder figure from a lost demonic sect. You sure brag shamelessly, asking me to leave with you without even telling me what you need me for?”</p>
<p>Shen Kuo waved his hand and conjured a creepy talisman with purple light. Smiling sinisterly, he said “In the grand revival of the Fan Tian Sect, both you and Su Yi Shui are indispensable. Since you won’t cooperate willingly, don’t blame me, your junior, for being offensive!”</p>
<p>His technique wasn’t taught by Xishan. When the talisman advanced, it carried a sinister aura, chilling to the bone.</p>
<p>Ranran tried to use qi to control her swords to break his talisman, but found the purple light seemingly indestructible, like an impenetrable web closing in on her.</p>
<p>As she was enveloped, her spiritual energy seemed suppressed as well. Her swords fell from her control and clattered to the ground.</p>
<p>Shen Kuo could tell that Ranran had no strength left to defend herself and couldn’t help but smirk. He had initially planned to take care of Su Yi Shui first, then deal with Xue Ranran.</p>
<p>But unexpectedly, after their bickering during the journey back to West Mountain, Su Yi Shui decided to expel Xue Ranran out of the sect.</p>
<p>It would seem that he wouldn’t tolerate his former mentor for a moment longer.</p>
<p>Shen Kuo originally didn’t want to act rashly, but seeing even the Rebirth Tree in Xue Ranran’s courtyard uprooted, it seemed like those two had no room left for reconciliation.</p>
<p>This was a heaven-sent opportunity, too good to miss.</p>
<p>Now, Shen Kuo didn’t want to waste any more time. He summoned the ancient long-lost Deity Killing Talisman. With Xue Ranran’s current strength, she would not be able to withstand this ancient demonic array. Once subdued, she would soon lose consciousness and be easy to capture.</p>
<p>Shen Kuo felt he could carry her away soon.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran collapsed very quickly. At this moment, he suddenly felt a cold wind come up from behind him. Without time to turn around, he quickly dodged sideways.</p>
<p>In spite of his quick reflexes, his spiritual shield was still shattered.</p>
<p>A sharp sword pierced his back. Shen Kuo could only move to let the blow narrowly miss his heart but still received a serious wound.</p>
<p>By the time he turned around, he saw the person controlling the sword swiftly advancing towards him.</p>
<p>The person with a solemn killing intent was none other than Su Yi Shui, who should have been in seclusion at West Mountain.</p>
<p>Shen Kuo’s spiritual prowess was much higher than what he had shown at Xishan. If not for this sword strike, Su Yi Shui, whose spiritual energy had been depleting of late, might not have been his match.</p>
<p>Just then, Ranran, who had fallen to the ground, suddenly leaped up as well. Clearly, her previous display of weakness was a deception to catch him off guard.</p>
<p>What could lull someone into a sense of complacency than almost defeating your prey?</p>
<p>But unfortunately for him, these two was seamlessly in sync. Shen Kuo’s carelessness allowed Su Yi Shui to gain the upper hand. When he finally reacted, Su Yi Shui’s hand was already on his back, absorbing his spiritual energy without restraint.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui’s dantian was very empty, how could a starving person resist such a meal?</p>
<p>Shen Kuo was alarmed; at this rapid rate, he would soon be drained by Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>So, he didn’t care about Xue Ranran anymore and drew out his sword to turn and attack Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>Its too bad that, Su Yi Shui was already prepared and quickly affixed an immobilizing charm drawn by Elder Jiu on Shen Kuo’s forehead.</p>
<p>Although Elder Jiu was somewhat unreliable, his charms were still very effective. Shen Kuo was not only stabbed but also immobilized by the charm, leaving him with no other tricks.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Su Yi Shui then walked over with quick strides, took up Ranran’s wrist to check her pulse, asking her, “How is it, are you alright?”</p>
<p>Ranran shook her head and then said, “Ask him quickly, what does the Fan Tian Sect intend to do by scheming against us like this?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui nodded and stood up, taking out a Truth-telling Charm and affixing onto Shen Kuo.</p>
<p>Shen Kuo knew he had fallen into a trap. Although trapped, he remained calm and collected, only sneering coldly as he stared at the couple who had conspired against him. But when he saw Su Yishui stick a Truth-telling Talisman on him, his eyes suddenly filled with desperate fear.</p>
<p>“Master, I was wrong, please don’t ask me. I’ve already made a Soul Oath. If certain things are revealed, my soul will be destroyed and I’ll never be reincarnated!”</p>
<p>Shen Kuo knew the power of the Truth-telling Talisman and suddenly cried and pleaded in fear.</p>
<p>But Su Yi Shui remained unmoved, speaking coldly, “Where is the skull of the Demon King now? Who is the mastermind behind all these? What are you planning to do after capturing Ranran?”</p>
<p>Although unwilling, under the effect of the Truth-telling Charm, he had to answer truthfully to any questions.</p>
<p>So, even though he was reluctant, he had to speak, “The skull was taken by Mu Ranwu’s subordinates and sent to the Eternal Sea in the southeast. As for the mastermind behind this, we all in the Fan Tian Sect obey…”</p>
<p>When he reached this point, Shen Kuo, who was immobilized, suddenly widened his eyes, and his body spontaneously combusted, flames erupting from him…</p>
<p>He seemed to know he couldn’t escape death and let out a mournful laugh, “Fan Tian descends, changes the world, aids in the revival of gods, even in death… there’s life!”</p>
<p>In an instant, Shen Kuo had turned into a charred corpse, his burnt body dispersing and disappearing with the wind.</p>
<p>It seemed that what he had said before was indeed true. Someone had set a fatal seal on him; even if he wanted to reveal the mastermind behind the scenes, he would immediately be burnt to ashes, leaving nothing behind.</p>
<p>Ranran felt regretful. “Just who are these people, how can they have such great power? And where did this Fan Tian Sect come out from?”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Initially, back when she discovered the anomaly with the shoes by the stream, she had used voice channeling to secretly inform Su Yi Shui, whom she hadn’t spoken to for a few days.</p>
<p>So, the two of them devised a plan, deciding not to *startle the snake and see what Shen Kuo was up to. *<em>alert the enemy</em></p>
<p>Ranran had gone down the mountain with the intention to branch out their forces. She would pretend to leave but would hide in the shadows to track Shen Kuo and his accomplices.</p>
<p>However, she did not expect Shen Kuo to chase after her and insist on escorting her, so Ranran went along with it.</p>
<p>But when Ranran noticed he changed the route and headed to a remote area, where he may likely meet up with his accomplices, she realized she might not be able to handle it if they continued forward. So, she suddenly confronted him, exposing Shen Kuo’s true intentions.</p>
<p>Now that Shen Kuo had been burnt to ashes, their only clue was lost again.</p>
<p>“You knew he was suspicious, yet you went with him? Are you trying to get yourself killed?” After taking Ranran’s pulse and replenished her qi, Su Yi Shui asked her with a stern face.</p>
<p>Ranran also had not expected Shen Kuo’s hidden strength to be so formidable. He claimed to be an Elder of the Fan Tian Sect. The two imposing individuals around Mu Ranwu also seemed to be members of the Fan Tian Sect.</p>
<p>It seemed that this resurgent Fan Tian Sect was not to be underestimated. Even if the righteous forces of the world united, they might not be a match for this demonic sect!</p>
<p>However, when they had devised the plan with Su Yi Shui earlier, they only said she would be going home to visit her family, and there was no mention of her being expelled from Xishan.</p>
<p>Ranran felt that Su Yi Shui had turned what begun as pretense into something real, under the guise of hoodwinking Shen Kuo, to accomplish what he had always wanted to do.</p>
<p>Since he was no longer her master now, it was inappropriate for him to reprimand her like a father.</p>
<p>“Of course it was because I had sensed that you were following us, so I revealed my cards to him… Since the traitor within Xishan has been successfully exposed, Shen Kuo is dead, there’s no further need for me to covertly follow him. Although what I said in the study was an excuse, it was also half true. I do want to go back and see my parents.”</p>
<p>As Ranran spoke, she withdrew her wrist from Su Yi Shui’s large palm.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Su Yi Shui watched as her small hand quickly retracted in a split moment like a slippery fish, his expression turned even colder. “I know you were speaking from your heart, but right now, you are also a target of the Fan Tian Sect. Rushing to go to your parents may expose them to unnecessary risks…”</p>
<p>Ranran also knew this and said, “I’ll find a way on my own. Mister Su, please go back soon.”</p>
<p>This time, Su Yi Shui unceremoniously grabbed her wrist. “What? I expelled you, so you’re upset?”</p>
<p>Ranran pretended to be light-hearted. “What’s there to be upset about? Since we have no relationship now, you can also relax…”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui droned on “Even though you’re no longer my disciple, but I am still yours. We never dissolved our master-disciple relationship back then. As your disciple, how can I let my ill and weak Master wander the world?”</p>
<p>“Ah? Didn’t you… defect from the sect back then?” Ranran gaped, recalling the proud tone with which her second uncle master had spoken about this.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui now experienced firsthand how once this girl severed ties, she would immediately heartlessly rebuff people she once knew.</p>
<p>When he said he would expel her, he was only in jest. He just wanted to see the young girl’s surprised expression when caught off guard.</p>
<p>But he didn’t expect that this woman, even after her rebirth, *she still behaved like she didn’t give a damn, and wouldn’t take anything with her when she left!<br/>*from poem 徐志摩的《再别康桥》 <br/>悄悄的我走了,正如我悄悄的来；我挥一挥衣袖,不带走一片云彩</p>
<p>So, he paused and said mildly, “Yutong said that although I had left back then, you never officially expelled me from Xishan. In the end, you even made me the sect master of West Mountain. The master-disciple relationship still stands, and you can’t shake off our connection!”</p>
<p>Ranran blinked her eyes in disbelief; she never imagined that one day she would be able to stand above Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p><em>So does that mean, she could be his master?</em></p>
<p>Unable to contain her laughter, she said, “Are you serious? Then I won’t stand on ceremony…”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When Ranran finally showed a sly smile like a mischievous child, Su Yi Shui felt a sense of relief in his heart. For some reason, he couldn’t stand her with an indifferent expression, being uncaring about her own life or death.</p>
<p>Her white and tender face, still looked better with a smile, even though this brat was not above to take a yard after giving her an inch. After hearing his words, she actually changed her gaze and dragged out her words, “Shui’er… go, fetch some clean water for your master!”</p>
<p>This rascal, intentionally calling him “Shui’er,” which she knew he hated the most.</p>
<p>A vindictive smile also gradually appeared on Su Yi Shui’s handsome face. “…Master, have you ever heard of the term ‘wayward’ in this world? What a coincidence, I am just that kind of rebellious and unfilial disciple!”</p>
<p>Now Ranran also experienced the struggles of Mu Qingge. It was really likely to end up dying young after taking in an unruly disciple!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Now, although Xue Ranran had taken on the title of Su Yi Shui’s master, she had none of the authority that came with being a master.</p>
<p>After they came out of the dense forest, they did not return to Xishan in a hurry. Stopping in a town to eat, Ranran saw some freshly made raw marinated large crabs in a small inn, full of golden yellow roe, and she really wanted to eat it.</p>
<p>But Su Yi Shui forbade her with a stern face, saying that she was weak now and eating something wrong might cause trouble for her stomach.</p>
<p>If Su Yi Shui had indulged her like a doting father in the past, trying to compensate and fulfill her desires as much as possible, now he was like a debtor from her past life, with a sour face and contradicting Ranran at every turn.</p>
<p>She could endure in other matters, but when it came to food, Ranran was as persistent as Elder Jiu. When he refused to let her eat it, Ranran became truly angry, suggesting politely once again that they should part ways.</p>
<p>Their bond between master and disciple was shallow, there was no need to force it. She could go through the formalities now and call it quits, each going their own merry way.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui snorted coldly, “You want to part ways, but do you have the ability? Defeat me, then talk about severing our master-disciple ties!”</p>
<p>It turned out that this annoying bond between master and disciple was even harder to sever than a couple divorcing! And the key was there wasn’t even a court to complain to, it truly left one speechless.</p>
<p>Ranran’s face fell slightly as she poked dejectedly at her rice with her chopsticks. Su Yi Shui watched her coldly, perhaps feeling satisfaction over controlling his master…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>They stayed in an inn temporarily. At night, Su Yi Shui knocked on her door carrying a small earthen pot.</p>
<p>It turned out Su Yi Shui had found the small shop unclean; there seemed to be something dirty in the nails of the person who prepared the crabs.</p>
<p>So, he gone back with live crabs he had bought, spending money to have the chef prepare a serving separately for him.</p>
<p>Customers are king and Su Yi Shui was generous with payment, so the chef obediently washed his hands, trimmed his nails, cleaned the crabs thoroughly, prepared the ingredients, and made this one pot, all clean and proper.</p>
<p>But Su Yi Shui still pulled a long face. He could not understand why he acted this way, and it felt preposterous to him that he did it. However, when he later saw Ranran holding the pot as if it were a precious treasure, his expression improved slightly.</p>
<p>The next morning, after the crabs had been fully marinated and sliced open, the rich yellow crab roe spread over steaming rice, drizzled with the marinate sauce, was incredibly delicious.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui had not believed when Yutong told him, that he had once indulged this girl and taken her all over the streets of the capital to eat at different stalls.</p>
<p>But now, watching her satisfied expression and bright shining eyes as she ate, he couldn’t help but think that he might really have been bewitched enough to travel around to indulge her love for food and drink.</p>
<p>After devouring a large crab, Ranran felt a bit embarrassed but smiled at her rebellious disciple. He may look cold, but he was still the same soft-hearted master.</p>
<p>So, she quickly put peeled crab legs and roe into Su Yi Shui’s bowl.</p>
<p>“Shifu, eat while the rice is hot. If you’re afraid of the cold-nature of the crab, you can drizzle some ginger juice.”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui accepted the bowl slowly. “Why are you calling me Shifu again? Weren’t you planning not to acknowledge me, and not seeing me ever again?”</p>
<p>Ranran scooped a spoonful and brought it to Su Yi Shui’s mouth, coaxing him like a child, “I’m so young, how can I be your master? Even if you have expelled me from West Mountain, I’m still used to calling you Shifu…”</p>
<p>She brought up her age, and Su Yi Shui’s handsome face soured a bit more as he dragged his words, “Am I that old?”</p>
<p>Ranran quickly waved her hand “Not old, not old at all! Eating this mouthful of crab will help maintain your youthful appearance!”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui snorted coldly and finally ate the spoonful of crab from Ranran’s hand.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, this was the first time just the two of them ate amicably together since Ranran’s past life was revealed. </p>
<p>Su Yi Shui also didn’t want to bring up their past grievances for now. He wasn’t very hungry to begin with, so after a few bites, he peeled a whole crab for Ranran, letting her eat to her heart’s content.</p>
<p>This kind of raw marinated food was fine to indulge in occasionally, but if eaten too often, won’t it be harmful to health?</p>
<p>Ranran no longer had the hobby of collecting handsome men in this life, but her love for food was stronger than before. Perhaps it was her last lingering obsession before her soul was scattered.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After finishing the meal, the two finally discussed their next steps. Su Yi Shui said, “I deliberately left my aura at the top of West Mountain. If there’s still a traitor at Xishan, they would think I’m still in seclusion there. We should take this opportunity to find Mu Ranwu first, to locate the whereabouts of that skull. If we find out about the lair of Fan Tian Sect, we won’t have to be passive anymore.”</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu’s whereabouts were not as conspicuous as before.</p>
<p>However, with a little effort, they were still able find out. It was said that she was heading towards the Huainan area, seemingly going towards the sea.</p>
<p>This coincided with Ranran’s previous wish to travel south. Su Yi Shui recalled Ranran saying she wanted to travel to the mountains and rivers, so now they could enjoy themselves along the way.</p>
<p>On inconsequential matters, Su Yi Shui didn’t mind indulging Xue Ranran a bit. Especially now with unknown enemies lurking in the shadows; they couldn’t risk using their true qi to reveal their whereabouts.</p>
<p>So, they didn’t even use concealment techniques but hired a boat to travel south along the river.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As for the Rebirth Tree, Su Yi Shui had actually sealed it within a glass bead using enchantments.</p>
<p>The shallow soil inside the bead was said to be the *residual magical soil left behind by **Gun, the father of Dayu who controlled the flood waters. When exposed to wind, this soil would extend several miles, blocking river channels, making it very precious. The weak little tree was planted on this soil, and the Rebirth Tree was sealed within the bead, put on a silver chain, and placed around Ranran’s neck.<br/>*息壤 <em>xirang is magical soil in chinese mythology, has the ability to self expand and grow</em> <br/>**鲧禹治水 </p>
<p>In Su Yi Shui’s words, this Rebirth Tree was no ordinary tree of the mortal realm, but had been held up here, slowly losing what’s left of its spiritual energy.</p>
<p>He contemplated for a long time and finally came up with this method, planting the Rebirth Tree on the <em>xirang</em> soil to see if it could alleviate Ranran’s debilitating symptoms.</p>
<p>After wearing this specially-made necklace, Ranran’s complexion improved significantly over the next few days, and her fair skin finally regained a rosy hue like peach petals.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>So during the day, Su Yi Shui accompanied her to explore mountains and sight-seeing and when the moonlight sprinkled over the river, she accompanied Su Yi Shui in meditation, absorbing the essence of the *sun and moon.<br/><em>*moonlight is still reflected sunlight lol</em></p>
<p>Perhaps it was because Su Yi Shui had originally given her half of his golden core, so when they sat together in meditation, their vitality qi in their dantian connected. Circulating in harmony, their cultivation surpassing several times over compared to when they had practiced alone.</p>
<p>In the past, Su Yi Shui seemed to have a restraining fear due to Ranran’s weak body. In the foundational cultivation, it was all about gradual progress, guiding her step by step into deeper realms.</p>
<p>But now with an unknown major enemy rapidly approaching, Su Yi Shui only hoped Ranran could become stronger, at least enough to protect herself. Therefore, his demands became even stricter than before.</p>
<p>Although Ranran had extraordinary talent in cultivation, her enlightenment far surpassing many peers, she was still far from meeting Su Yi Shui’s demanding requirements.</p>
<p>For example, today, Su Yi Shui taught her the mantra of Thunderous Passage, requiring Qi to penetrate the meridians instantly while also unleashing a critical hit.</p>
<p>Ranran had no problem with the Qi penetrating the meridians, but unleashing a critical hit required using the power of *Gen and Shen.<br/>*<em>I don’t know how to explain these, I suppose we can think of them as acupoints to channel power from?</em></p>
<p>She couldn’t grasp this Gen and Shen power. Su Yishui only mentioned it was a tongue-root technique, combined with Dan Tian activation.</p>
<p>But as Ranran activated her Qi while silently moving her tongue, she couldn’t grasp the technique.</p>
<p>The Thunderous Passage was a unique skill created by Su Yi Shui, just like the Qi cultivation method he had taught Gao Cang and the others before, both were breaking new ground and very profound.</p>
<p>Such techniques were often most difficult to master at the entry level. Once surpassed, they would be smooth and unobstructed, making rapid progress. This was also the crucial factor how Su Yi Shui had managed to surpass other powerful members of various sects in spite of his young age.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>And now, Ranran was stuck at this entry step.</p>
<p>The two of them were now practicing a method similar to dual cultivation in sects, so they sat facing each other, very close.</p>
<p>When Ranran spoke with her eyes closed, the moonlight was clear and spilled on her fair face, and even the flutter of her eyelashes was illuminated by a small fishing lamp hanging on the boat, clearly seen by the man.</p>
<p>“Shifu, where are the Gen Shen? Why can’t I find it?” Ranran didn’t know that Su Yi Shui had been watching her attentively for a long while now. She half-tilted her head, pouting her pink lips slightly as she asked.</p>
<p>Her delicate chin was slightly raised, looking as if she was asking for a kiss…</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui didn’t know what came over him; he suddenly felt a rush of heat and abruptly leaned over, pressing his lips against hers.</p>
<p>Ranran’s eyes opened in shock, almost thinking that Su Yi Shui had regained his memories…</p>
<p>But after the passionate kiss ended, and her tongue was still tingling, Su Yi Shui lifted his head expressionlessly and said to her, “Now do you know where Gen Shen are?”</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">重遇故人    MEETING OLD FRIENDS</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Ranran didn’t expect that after the great Water-Fetching cultivation method, Su Yi Shui would create such a meticulous and attentive acupoint recognition technique.</p>
<p>So when they sat face to face, and she was “guided” by him, she didn’t have time to react at all, just stared at him with wide eyes.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui was actually quite annoyed as well. He didn’t know what he was doing just now. It seemed like the moonlight tonight was very enchanting, clouding his judgment momentarily.</p>
<p>He was also suddenly inspired, for him to come up with that.</p>
<p>Ranran initially thought he had regained his memory, but it turned out to be in vain again. Seeing his *advantage-taking yet composed handsome face, she couldn’t help but feel mad. “Probably none of the disciples from Xishan knows where the points are. Is your tongue enough to go around? Do you need to guide each and every one of them?”<br/>*得了便宜还卖乖 <em>is the original phrase: won advantage but pretend to be innocent</em></p>
<p>As Su Yi Shui looked at her red lips, and her flushed and sarcastic expression, he felt another surge of heat. He didn’t know what came over him; his body seemed to act independently of his mind. He leaned down again, lowering his thick lashes and gave her some more guidance. But this time, the guidance lasted even longer, and his big palm even supported the back of her head.</p>
<p>This kiss was exceptionally intense, and Ranran had to close her eyes again to cope with it.</p>
<p>When their lips separated again, Ranran gave his chest a push and said fiercely, “I’m not practicing anymore!”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui lowed his eyes, looking at her and suddenly asked, “You have kissed before?”</p>
<p>The first kiss was so sweet that he got a bit lost in it. But the second time, he realized that this seemingly inexperienced girl was quite responsive to him… Could it be, that she had kissed someone else before?</p>
<p>Thinking about this, an unfamiliar sense of jealousy surged in Su Yi Shui’s heart to his skull, the sourness giving him a bit of toothache.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After pushing him away, Xue Ranran stood up, saying loudly, “Yes, I kissed a pig before!” With that, she turned and jumped off the boat, walking on the ripples towards the riverbank.</p>
<p>How dare he turn the tables on the victim first? She didn’t even bring up his transgression of repeatedly kissing his female disciple from before!</p>
<p>If it was the past, it could be explained that Su Yi Shui couldn’t hold himself back because of his complicated feelings with two lifetimes. But now, he obviously didn’t remember his past, yet he still kissed her. But he had that calm, unaffected demeanor, which was quite infuriating!</p>
<p>As for his constant romantic entanglements, first with Wen Hongshan and then Mu Qingge. Surely not everyone is seduced by his handsome good looks, right? He was probably quite the experienced playboy, the Casanova of the cultivation world!</p>
<p>Ranran suddenly wondered, would he behave the same way if the person sitting before him was Qiu Xi’er or some other female disciple?</p>
<p>The more she thought about it, the angrier she became. If her cultivation was higher, she would restore the prestige of the sect master and clean up Xishan, and punish this womanizer.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Just then, Su Yi Shui also came ashore, standing behind her and saying confidently, “So, I have kissed you before?”</p>
<p>She sounded so fierce that Su Yi Shui naturally could tell that she should be referring to him as the pig.</p>
<p>Although he was called a pig, Su Yi Shui wasn’t angry. Instead, he felt quite relieved. Although he had suspicions that he had been seduced by this girl before, it was better than her having past affairs with other men.</p>
<p>As Ranran turned around, she asked him directly, “If it had been Qiu Xi’er or some other female disciple just now, would you have given the same guidance?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui was slightly stunned by her scenario, finding it completely unacceptable even in imagination. He furrowed his brows and said, “I’m not someone who guides every fool!”</p>
<p>After hearing this, Xue Ranran felt a lot of her frustration dissipate inexplicably.</p>
<p>Although it seemed like he was calling her stupid, she still felt a little sweet inside. Seeing Ranran smiling with her head lowered, Su Yi Shui thought the little demoness was proud of her boundless charm, gaining yet another admirer.</p>
<p>So he couldn’t help but remind her, “Hey, don’t look so pleased with yourself. I really just couldn’t stand your lack of comprehension just now…”</p>
<p>Ranran’s face fell slightly. After shooting a glare at him, she jumped back onto the boat and resumed her meditation.</p>
<p>This kind of hands-on teaching was indeed effective. When Ranran performed the Thunderous Passage technique again, the energy flow through her meridians was smooth, especially at the spot where her tongue had tingled during the kiss.</p>
<p>Once she grasped the basics, Ranran’s cultivation progress could only be described as *making great strides.<br/>一日千里 <em>going thousands of miles in a day</em></p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>However, during the daytime, they still visited nearby mountain villages and towns for leisure.</p>
<p>On this day, when they arrived at Gong County, Ranran glanced at a notice posted on the city gate and couldn’t help but go “Eh?”.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui’s hands were full of snacks she had bought earlier. After hearing her exclaim, he also took a look at the notice.</p>
<p>It was a notice about a missing wife. Apparently, the wife had left her husband due to poverty or some other reason, and the husband was posting notices pleading for her return.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? Do you know this woman in the picture?”</p>
<p>Ranran turned her head and whispered, “Look, doesn’t the woman in this picture resemble Zhou Feihua?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui frowned for a moment. “Zhou Feihua? I’ve only heard her name before, never met her.”</p>
<p>Ranran frowned. Of course, he wouldn’t remember events from the capital, including the runaway Consort Jing who had faked her own death.</p>
<p>But Zhou Feihua’s husband… Wasn’t it Su Yu? Could it be that Su Yu had instructed people to post wife-finding notices and was searching for Zhou Feihua?</p>
<p>If that were the case, she couldn’t help but worry for Consort Jing. Was Su Yu planning something drastic against her?</p>
<p>In the following days, as they visited several villages, they noticed more of the same notice in prominent spots. However, Su Yi Shui discovered that, there were increasingly more missing person notices on the boards. Many had no pictures, just brief descriptions of the missing persons, often mentioning disappearing near the riverbanks, with rewards offered for any information leading to their discovery, dead or alive.</p>
<p>What was happening here? How were so many people going missing without a trace, and why were there no bodies?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Yet in cultivation, calmness of mind was crucial. Otherwise, why would there be the practice of seclusion and meditation?</p>
<p>Although they had questions, they continued their routine of enjoying thoroughly during the day and practicing diligently at night.</p>
<p>They would rest on the boat every night, choosing a quiet stretch of river. In the stillness of the night, they would sit cross-legged, exchanging their consonance energies.</p>
<p>However, every time she sat facing Su Yi Shui, it was a test of Ranran’s will to calm her heart.</p>
<p>For instance, now when she opened her eyes during meditation, she found Su Yi Shui staring at her intently, and she wasn’t sure how long he had been watching her.</p>
<p>“Hey, it’s hard for me to concentrate when you are like this!”</p>
<p>Since the day her Shifu “guided” her so intimately with his own mouth, Ranran stopped calling him “Shifu” that she was used to, and simply referred to him as “Hey.”</p>
<p>After all, their relationship was too complicated, and she had already been expelled from Xishan. Calling him Shifu, would be too much flattery for him.</p>
<p>And so, calling him “Hey” was more efficient.</p>
<p>However, Su Yi Shui felt that her casual address was quite impolite. But if she called him the alienating “Mister Su” again, that would seem even less natural than “Hey.”</p>
<p>He wasn’t sure why he always *decided to go easy on her, but he endured her disrespectful address.<br/>*锱铢必较 <em>excessive nitpicking over small details</em>  大打折扣 <em>big discount, reduction</em></p>
<p>Even though he knew she was the reincarnation of Mu Qingge, Su Yi Shui felt that Ranran the young girl, was much more likable than in her previous life.</p>
<p>At least for now, she hadn’t gone astray yet. She wasn’t surrounded by so many men and Su Yi Shui found it easy to get along with her.</p>
<p>Most of the time, he even found it very delightful to watch her meditate or eat.</p>
<p>Beautiful things naturally attracted more attention, and he only realized he was staring at her again after he heard Ranran’s protests.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he always remained calm and composed. Even when he was caught, he would just close his eyes leisurely.</p>
<p>As Ranran looked at the man with closed eyes, his thick brows, straight nose, and long eyelashes longer than those of a girl’s… even his attractive lips was enchanting, and she couldn’t help but keep staring as well. </p>
<p>During this period of time, it was actually a rare chance for the two of them to be alone together, reminding her of the happiness she had felt on the sea island. If time could freeze at this moment, would she also have no regrets in this life?</p>
<p>She stared blankly, lost in thought. The man sitting opposite her suddenly opened his eyes and caught her staring .</p>
<p>“You don’t let me look at you, yet you stare at me like this. What do you have to say about that?”</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t expect him to suddenly open his eyes, and felt a bit embarrassed. She could only force herself to say, “You’re good-looking, but won’t allow others to look?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui looked at her *enigmatically and suddenly said, “You have half of my golden core and have my aura, so you’re not allowed to flirt with other men.”<br/>*高深莫测 </p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>It would seem that her past fault of being lustful hadn’t changed. She still liked looking at handsome men, and every time Su Yi Shui thought of the numerous young men who surrounded Mu Qingge in her past life, he felt very annoyed.</p>
<p>Back then, he always treated Mu Qingge very coldly, rebuffing her advances.</p>
<p>But later, Mu Qingge met Su Yu. Because he was his junior uncle, the two looked somewhat similar. Suddenly, Mu Qingge seemed to transfer her warm affections to Su Yu, always smiling and charming with him, as if Su Yu had become his replacement.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui believed he didn’t like Mu Qingge, but every time he thought about this, he felt very upset.</p>
<p>So seeing Ranran’s unchanged habit, to like to stare at handsome men, Su Yi Shui felt it necessary to make things clear. If she carries half of his golden core and go around cheating with other men… he wasn’t going to agree to that!</p>
<p>After hearing this, Ranran felt both angry and amused. “According to you, am I not allowed to be friendly with other men in this life?”</p>
<p>As she spoke, her big eyes shone brightly and she tilted her head slightly forward. Su Yi Shui felt tempted to guide her on activating the Genshen acupoint again.</p>
<p>This time, Ranran was vigilant and suddenly covered his mouth with her hand. “What are you doing? You’re not allowed to be frivolous with your master!”</p>
<p>If she didn’t say that, Su Yi Shui might not have found it amusing in his indignation. He smiled even more evilly “Alright then, how about this, you be frivolous with your disciple instead. Didn’t you used to love trapping me in the corridor?”</p>
<p>Ranran felt that he had kissed the palm of her hand blocking his lips and blushed furiously.</p>
<p>But she could understand herself from her past life. Teasing this kind of difficult and handsome youth was quite fun, seeing him pout and glare with his handsome face… it was really quite entertaining…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As they were teasing each other, Su Yi Shui suddenly stopped moving. Ranran also became alert because she heard faint splashing sounds underwater.</p>
<p>The splashing sound would be too loud for fish.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui was alert and immediately pulled Ranran up, leaping out of the water.</p>
<p>Just as they jumped up, dozens of people wearing fishskin clothes also leaped out of the water, their sharp hooks aimed straight at the two on the boat.</p>
<p>Their eyes also emitted a strange blue light in the darkness.</p>
<p>Ranran looked carefully and realized that these people weren’t wearing fishskin clothes; rather, like the demonized woman at the Wangxiang River, their bodies were covered in sharp fish scales, and their hook-like protrusions were actually their claws on their hands.</p>
<p>Dozens of demonized enemies attacked them simultaneously, causing the river water to ripple, nearly capsizing the small boat.</p>
<p>She remembered how chaotic it was when dealing with one demonized woman in the past. Now with more than a dozen attacking them, it would be even more difficult.</p>
<p>But Ranran was no longer the weakling by Wangxiang River. Having just mastered the Thunderous Passage, she had a training ground to practice her skills. Easily summoning her energy, she effortlessly repelled the water demons attacking them.</p>
<p>But more and more of these water demons crawled out of the river, totaling about twenty or thirty, eventually flipping the entire boat into the water.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui also realized the situation wasn’t good. These demonized people were empowered by the Seven Evil Transformation talismans and seemed more ferocious than the woman at Wangxiang River.</p>
<p>Fighting them on water would put them at a big disadvantage. So he grabbed Ranran’s arm, preparing to fly to the riverbank.</p>
<p>However, just as they reached the riverbank, they felt an invisible spiritual shield enveloping them, that was impervious to their attacks.</p>
<p>The people who set up this scheme were truly diabolical. Although these water demons weren’t a match for Su Yi Shui and Ranran, continuing like this would still exhaust a significant portion of their energy. After all, these people were driven by the Seven Evil Transformation talismans and would not feel exhaustion.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Just then, both the riverbanks suddenly erupted in loud fire crackers, cymbals and drums, accompanied by a dazzling display of fireworks.</p>
<p>The ferocious water demons, upon hearing the deafening firecrackers, emitted sharp and short cries, quickly turning and jumping back into the river.</p>
<p>Ranran understood, that these demonized water creatures feared bright lights and loud noises. In the blink of an eye, all the water demons vanished from the river.</p>
<p>As they disappeared, the spiritual shield overing the river also vanished.</p>
<p>At that moment, torches surrounded the riverbank, and a woman on horseback shouted loudly at the two standing on the overturned boat, “You two are actually still alive? Where do you skilled experts hail from?”</p>
<p>Ranran heard the woman’s voice and found it familiar. With the faint light from the bank, she recognized the woman on horseback and shouted happily, “Consort Jing… no, Miss Zhou, it’s me, Xue Ranran!”</p>
<p>It turned out that the woman on horseback was none other than Consort Jing, who escaped from the cold palace by feigning death, and now known as Zhou Feihua.</p>
<p>When she escaped from the palace, she had vowed to travel far and wide. Since then, there had been no news of her until a few days ago when they saw the notices looking for her. In the blink of an eye, they have reunited here.</p>
<p>At that moment, Zhou Feihua also recognized Xue Ranran and Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>When the two of them jumped onto the riverbank, Zhou Feihua breathed a sigh of relief. “Heaven truly blessed us. I was just thinking of sending someone to West Mountain to ask for your help, but I didn’t expect you to already be here.”</p>
<p>Ranran recalled the shocking scene just now and asked, “What has happened here? How did so many demonized creatures appear?”</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua sighed and turned to the dozen or so elders behind her. “Gentlemen elders, these two are powerful cultivators. With their help, the villages along the river might have a chance.”</p>
<p>The villagers saw the two of them fighting off so many water demons and still managing to escape unharmed, their previously troubled faces now showing a hint of joy.</p>
<p>After speaking, Zhou Feihua turned to Ranran and Su Yi Shui again. “This area is near the water, and after these water demons gather their strength, they will strike again. Hurry with me into the village. Once we’re in, I’ll explain everything in detail.”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>So Su Yi Shui and Ranran followed Zhou Feihua to the QiongQi Village by the river.</p>
<p>The entire village seemed to be in a state of war, with the outer walls surrounded by fences made of thorns. Outside the fences, there was a ten meter wide ditch filled with white lime powder.</p>
<p>Usually, the villagers were frugal and rarely kept lamps burning through the night unless they had children studying in the family.</p>
<p>But now, every household in the village had lanterns hanging high at the door, illuminating the night like a festival, albeit lacking the joyous atmosphere. The village was silent, devoid of laughter and chatter.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the sound of a child crying at night seemed to be quickly suppressed by the adults, the entire village was shrouded in an undeniable terror.</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua was still dressed in men’s clothing, but instead of a coiled bun, she had a long thick braid tied behind her head, giving her a clean and crisp appearance.</p>
<p>After inviting Su Yi Shui and Ranran into her temporary residence in the village community, she had food and drinks brought in and began to talk about her experiences during this period.</p>
<p>It turned out that shortly after her feigned death, portraits of her began appearing in various prefectures and counties, with people secretly searching for her.</p>
<p>Later, she found out that her feigned death had been discovered by Su Yu. She didn’t know if the emperor couldn’t sleep at night and wanted to watch someone to do a sword dance again to ease his mind, but was frustrated because he couldn’t find a suitable one. So, he remembered her sleepless nights of sword dancing for him, and out of boredom, he suddenly dispatched a large number of people to search for her whereabouts.</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua had already seen through it all and didn’t think the emperor was reminiscing about old feelings. She just felt that the emperor was just used to having things his way, and he was feeling a bit resentful since he wasn’t the one who called it quits.</p>
<p>So, she did not dare to go to bustling places anymore and ended up here.</p>
<p>The people here were simple and the grains were fragrant. Few villagers ventured into the city, and even if they did, no one bothered to look at the missing wife notices.</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua had originally planned to stay here for a while before going to the Eastern Islands to visit Fusang.</p>
<p>However, just ten days ago, people in the village began disappearing while fishing by the river. Given the heavy rain and waves on those days, accidents were understandable.</p>
<p>But soon after, traces of water monsters were found by the river. Zhou Feihua had seen the water demon sent into the capital from Wangxiang Pass, so she immediately understood that someone here was deliberately kidnapping the villagers and turning them into water demons.</p>
<p>Although the local village elders reported to the authorities, the constables they sent also went missing. Combined with the previous monster attacks, the stationed troops in various places were preoccupied.</p>
<p>Small villages like QiongQi village were at the bottom of the list even in emergencies. Fortunately, the Miss Zhou currently residing here was righteous.</p>
<p>After saving the village head’s daughter-in-law with her sword at the riverside, she organized local patrols to monitor the riverbanks and had the villagers dig ditches and spread lime powder to block the invasion of the water demons.</p>
<p>Just three days ago, the water demons attempted to attack the village at night. Unfortunately, they had water on them and screamed in pain as soon as they burned as they crawled over the lime.</p>
<p>And Zhou Feihua has discovered their weaknesses, and had people sounding gongs, drums, and set off fireworks, scaring off the water demons.</p>
<p>Tonight, Zhou Feihua was patrolling the riverbank as usual when she saw a fishing boat with a lit lamp capsizing in the river. Countless blue eyes were shimmering, and she thought a passing passenger boat was in trouble, so she quickly led people to set off fireworks, only to find out that the ones rescued were Su Yi Shui and Xue Ranran.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran didn’t expect to encounter Zhou Feihua here. She only knew that Zhou Feihua had a very close relationship with Elder Mu, and they had been good sisters.</p>
<p>But now that she knew she was Mu Qingge’s reincarnation, which meant Zhou Feihua was her friend from her past life.</p>
<p>So, when she looked at Zhou Feihua, Ranran couldn’t help but hold Zhou Feihua’s hand, but she didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p>After all, she had no memories of her past life. If she rashly acknowledged their sisterhood, there wouldn’t be any old feelings to continue either.</p>
<p>However, Zhou Feihua obviously didn’t know Ranran’s true identity. Still, she had many things on her mind that she wanted to share with her, since Ranran knew of her past.</p>
<p>That night, because they needed to discuss tracking down the water demons, Ranran and Zhou Feihua shared a room.</p>
<p>Ranran had originally planned to sit cross-legged on a chair and meditate all night, but Zhou Feihua insisted on sleeping together and sharing secrets.</p>
<p>“Why are you sitting so far away? I have to shout to talk to you. Skipping meditation for one night won’t delay your path to become an immortal.” </p>
<p>Ranran also loved to be slack off. After hearing this, she took off her outer robe and lay down next to Zhou Feihua. “Consort Jing, I saw notices in nearby counties with your portrait on them. But they were written with hopes of a runaway wife returning home, the family not holding grudges, and such…. Is Su Yu looking for you?”</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua chuckled sarcastically. “What Consort Jing? That notice is just lifting the final veil that is concealing shame. No matter how grand the palace and my previous status, I was still just a concubine. He couldn’t directly express himself because of royal dignity, so he gave me the identity of a fugitive legitimate wife in the notice. When I have the time, I’ll express my gratitude facing towards the capital.”</p>
<p>Ranran blinked and asked softly “Why does he want you to go back?”</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua turned  and looked at the young girl’s face full of spirit and charm, and sighed, “You’re still young and don’t understand that men can be despicable at times. When you think he is dazzling, he would see you as insignificant as weeds and stones. But when he realized he missed a convenient woman by his side, he thought he could just beckon and bring her back. My father said that the emperor sent people to the ancestral home several times, hinting for my return. He can forgive the past and won’t charge me with the crime of deceiving the emperor. Even if I had faked my death, he can let me take on the identity of Consort Jing’s cousin and re-enter the palace as a Consort…”</p>
<p>Ranran nodded and looked at the dignified and handsome Consort Jing “If I were a man, I would also love someone like you. It’s no wonder the dog emperor can’t let you go.”</p>

<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Zhou Feihua burst into laughter and pinched Ranran’s tender cheeks, saying, “If you were a man, with this sweet talking mouth of yours, I’m afraid many girls would fall for you!”</p>
<p>When she talked about Su Yu, her tone was relaxed.</p>
<p>It was clear that Consort Jing had already emerged from the bitter and unspoken feelings she had when she left the palace. Spending time in the vast world had made her heart wild; how could she be willing to be a caged bird again?</p>
<p>Even if Zhou Feihua still had some lingering feelings for Su Yu, she was unwilling to go back to the past. Moreover, her father had publicly stated that she was dead, so she would not return and cause her father more worry.</p>
<p>After sharing her own troubles, Zhou Feihua was actually more interested in knowing Ranran’s recent situation.</p>
<p>When they last met, Su Yi Shui had sealed the spiritual spring with his own body, making him unusually violent and temperamental.</p>
<p>But now, hearing from Ranran that they had returned the spiritual spring, Su Yi Shui should have returned to normal. However, when he saw her just now, he looked indifferent and even furrowed his brow, saying, “Do I know you?”</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua was somewhat surprised, feeling that Su Yi Shui’s mind didn’t seem to be all there.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Explaining this would take quite some time. Ranran first asked if Consort Jing was tired, then talked about their journey from the Netherworld Realm and the Soul cleansing talisman that had been cast on Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua listened lying down at first, then sat up straight when she heard that Su Yi Shui had completely forgotten his affection for Mu Qingge, she snorted coldly “When I first met Qingge, he did get angry with her because of Su Yu. It turns out that he already had improper thoughts about his master back then. Was it because he couldn’t have her, he wanted to destroy her? That was why he harmed Mu Qingge?”</p>
<p>Ranran felt it necessary to clear Su Yi Shui’s name and said, “It’s not like that. It was actually Mu Qingge who decided to change his destiny and prevent him from becoming a demon lord. That’s what caused the misunderstanding.”</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua didn’t believe it and coldly snorted, “Why are you like Mu Qingge, always speaking well of him?”</p>
<p>Hmm… Ranran thought that if she disclosed that she was Mu Qingge right now, given Zhou Feihua’s temperament, she might brandish a sword and demand to know what conspiracy she had with Su Yi Shui. </p>
<p>So Ranran decided to wait for a more suitable opportunity to reveal such explosive news.</p>
<p>However, she was very curious about how she and Zhou Feihua had met in their past lives. Bringing up old memories, Zhou Feihua also felt a little melancholic.</p>
<p>“In the past, during the rebellion of the Prince, Su Yu was still young and couldn’t support himself in the court. My father was neutral at the time and didn’t want to get involved in the royal family’s internal strife. Once, Su Yu’s whereabouts were accidentally leaked, and he was attacked. I was part of his entourage. At the time, a woman in red descended from the sky and saved Su Yu. That’s how we met. Afterwards, Mu Qingge persuaded my father to support Su Yu, and I became a guard for the war goddess in the army.”</p>
<p>Ranran murmured to herself, “I always couldn’t figure it out, what kind of providence made me… made her dare to risk everything and completely change it?”</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua also sighed deeply. Mu Qingge had not only changed Su Yishui’s sovereign destiny back then, but also altered the fate of both her and Su Yu.</p>
<p>She said softly, “Back then, Mu Qingge seemed to have seen some heavenly mandate that shouldn’t have been seen by mortals. Su Yi Shui’s fate was akin to that of King Zhou. Such a fate could make one rule the world as a supreme ruler, but the end would be extremely lonely. She once said that while people thought she sought fame and reputation and wanted to save the world, but she knew that she only wanted to save one person…”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran listened quietly. Before, she couldn’t understand the feelings she had in her past life, but now she understood them somewhat.</p>
<p>The present Su Yi Shui, who had lost part of his memories, was already so aloof and arrogant. The past Su Yi Shui had been entangled in the vortex of power struggles, so he must have been extremely radical.</p>
<p>Back then, he had willingly invited the spiritual spring to possess him, wanting to leverage its power but not wanting to be completely controlled by it. So he chose to endure soul-rending pain every moment. If no one would save him, wouldn’t he be floating in an endless sea of suffering?</p>
<p>Thinking back to Su Yi Shui’s secret room in his home at the capital, where the walls were covered in shocking claw marks, one could imagine the pain he endured at the time.</p>
<p>Even though Su Yi Shui now resented Mu Qingge for changing his destiny, if Ranran faced such a choice as well, she would probably do the same without hesitation…</p>
<p>Talking about the past, Zhou Feihua suddenly remembered something Mu Qingge had told her back then, “But she once told me something nonsensical. She said that the key to the Netherworld Realm suddenly fell into her and Su Yi Shui’s hands, which was quite strange… Someone else like her, also seemed to have secretly glimpsed providence before…”</p>
<p>Ranran also sat up abruptly. She asked in a low voice, “Who was it, and where did they see providence?”</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua shook her head, “Qingge didn’t want to say more at the time, just saying that if I knew too much, I would invite trouble…”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>At this point, Zhou Feihua sighed, “I once asked Mu Qingge, but she said she couldn’t remember.”</p>
<p>Ranran frowned, “Mu Qingge? When did you see her?”</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua said, “Just yesterday, I took people to transport lime from the nearby town. We encountered her on the outskirts of Huxi Town. She was leading a few disciples to capture traitors in that town. It’s said that her disciple Wang Suizhi had been tempted by the Demonic Sect and secretly took away some of her newly acquired disciples, so she tracked them all the way here to punish the rebels.”</p>
<p>Ranran’s eyes widened, “Did she… find them?”</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua said, “She should be close to finding them. When she hurriedly left me, her attendants reported something, and it seemed like they got a clue. But I told her that I’m in Qiongqi village, so if she has time, she would probably come looking for me…”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran knew she couldn’t sleep tonight. Time was running out, and if she didn’t rescue her god of wealth disciple Wang Suizhi, this devoted disciple would likely be executed by Mu Ranwu that imposter .</p>
<p>So she got up quickly and went to knock on Su Yi Shui’s window next door.</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua also followed out, surprised and bewildered, “What are you doing? Are you going to bring Su Yi Shui to create trouble for Mu Qingge?”</p>
<p>Ranran couldn’t hide it anymore, and didn’t care if Zhou Feihua could handle it. She just said honestly, “Haven’t you ever wondered if the present Mu Qingge is still Mu Qingge? On the reincarnation tree, there were originally two fruits…”</p>
<p>After saying that, she tugged at her master’s sleeve and said, “Your senior brother is in trouble, do you want to come with me?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui didn’t have much affection for his senior brothers. Now, he was actually quite disapproving to seeing Xue Ranran protecting those foolish people like a mother hen.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t say anything. After all, they were here to investigate Mu Ranwu’s whereabouts. Since they had a clue, they naturally had to go and see what was going on.</p>
<p>But when they left the village, Su Yi Shui extended his arm and spun around outside the village. Then he said to Zhou Feihua, “I have set up a spirit shield here. You can enter from the main gate of the village. If there are unknown strangers, do not let them enter, or the spirit shield would no longer be effective.”</p>
<p>After that, the two of them disappeared into the night.</p>
<p>Leaving Zhou Feihua alone in the night breeze, confused about what Xue Ranran’s words meant…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>According to Zhou Feihua, she had met Mu Ranwu when she was leading villagers to buy white lime powder, so Mu Ranwu should also be in Huxi Town at this time.</p>
<p>When they arrived near Huxi town near Qiongqi Village, it was already late at night, and there wasn’t even a night watchman in the town.</p>
<p>The two of them used light body techniques to cross the city walls. Ranran closed her eyes and listened intently. Apart from the snoring in the surrounding households and the sound of children crying at night, she couldn’t hear any other suspicious sounds.</p>
<p>How were they going to search?</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui said, “You and her are both fruits on the reincarnation tree, but she hasn’t absorbed much of my core, so I can’t locate her either. See if you can find a way to sense her presence at a closer distance.”</p>
<p>Ranran understood what Su Yi Shui meant. But now, trying to sense Mu Ranwu was as mysterious as trying to communicate telepathically with a long-lost sister.</p>
<p>But unable to rely on metaphysics, there were other methods. She could guess why Wang Suizhi came here.</p>
<p>Although his business was spread all over the world, the more remote ones were still here in the Jiangnan area. When he hurriedly left with those children, he must have thought about their placement. </p>
<p>They were still young and couldn’t protect themselves. Even if he gave them money, it wouldn’t be enough. So he probably wanted to send these children to his shop as apprentices, learn some skills, and support themselves in the future.</p>
<p>With this in mind, they now had a direction. They just needed to look on the signboards of those shops, taking note of those bearing the Shanxi Wang name. The largest business of Wang Suizhi here was a rice shop.</p>
<p>When they landed from the eaves and came to the rice shop with the sign of Shanxi Wang Rice Shop, they could feel that something was wrong when they stood in front of the tightly closed gate.</p>
<p>The sign on the main door said “Closed for five days.” It was originally a shop selling rice, but they could smell a strong fishy stench, and water was seeping out from under the door.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui and Ranran exchanged looks and then leaped onto the roof together, peeling off the tiles to look down.</p>
<p>Under the moonlight pouring in, they saw several people tied to the pillars in the shop, some of them seemed to be children.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui jumped down first, followed by Ranran. After they landed, the shop was still silent, and those people with lowered heads still remained motionless, presenting an eerie sight.</p>
<p>When Su Yi Shui lit a spirit fire with his palm, Ranran could see the faces of those bound people clearly. She couldn’t help but gasp.</p>
<p>It turned out that those people dressed as shop assistants had deep blue scales covering their faces with tightly closed eyes. Ranran also recognized that the children were the ones who had escaped from Mu Ranwu, and the bearded man with scales growing on his body was indeed Wang Suizhi.</p>
<p>These people were covered in thick white foam, emitting a fishy smell. Water was flowing continuously under their feet, spreading across the entire floor of the shop.</p>
<p>Clearly, they had been cursed and were undergoing a transformation.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran quickly took out the Clear Mind Pill she refined and stuffed it into Wang Suizhi’s mouth. She used her palm to catalyze the pill’s effects.</p>
<p>Wang Suizhi gasped and half-opened his eyes with difficulty. When he recognized Xue Ranran, he weakly exclaimed, “Miss Xue, please leave this place quickly!”</p>
<p>Ranran comforted him, “Don’t be afraid, I’m here to save you all!”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Wang Suizhi’s eyes filled with tears, “My master… she’s gone mad! She actually colluded with some unknown Demonic cult. After they broke into the rice shop, they placed us under curses and bound us all. My master… master said those who betrayed her would suffer a life worse than death, and we would soon transform into water demons, becoming weapons of murder… Alas, my ability can see the life and death gates of others, but I didn’t know this town would be my own grave… My body has already started to change, maybe I will lose my sanity soon… I don’t want to harm people, please, Miss Xue, do me a favor, give me a quick and painless death. It’s just that those children were harmed because of me, I can only repay their lives in the next life!”</p>
<p>Ranran took out more pills and gave it to the shop assistants and the children. Then she said, “It’s not the end yet, why talk so pessimistically? These Seven Evil Transformation Curses are based on people’s greed. You are a good person, believe in yourself to suppress the spread of this curse. Before we come up with a solution, you must hold on!”</p>
<p>While they were talking, Su Yi Shui had quickly checked the entire shop. There was a passage behind the shop leading to the moat, usually convenient for boats to transport grain. The back door was half-open at this time.</p>
<p>The reason why no one was guarding here was that they had already hung the closed sign on the shop’s gate. When the people in the shop completed their transformation, these transformed people would certainly be driven by the evil talismans to jump into the river and be dispatched by others.</p>
<p>After the remaining people woke up, they were all shocked by their current state and started wailing in fear.</p>
<p>Wang Suizhi was quick-witted, fearing to attract attention, so he asked them to keep quiet and not scream. Su Yi Shui had already channeled the river water to wash away the sticky foam covering their bodies, and after letting them down, he saw strange runes tattooed on their backs with cinnabar.</p>
<p>It seems that these are why they are transforming.</p>
<p>However, the matter of undoing the talisman is not something Ranran and Su Yi Shui are good at. It seems that they were going to need Elder Jiu to help.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After saving everyone, Ranran planned to temporarily place them in the cave outside Qiongqi village.</p>
<p>The villagers have been frightened badly by the water demons these days. If they see these strange and ghostly figures, they might swarm up and beat them to death with sticks.</p>
<p>Did Mu Ranwu hate Wang Suizhi’s betrayal so much that she didn’t immediately kill him but used such a sinister method to torture him.</p>
<p>Ranran thought of the people who were accompanying Mu Ranwu, who seemed to be members of the Fantian Sect. Maybe they were eager to create a large number of water demons to expand their power, so they didn’t let go of anyone they could use.</p>
<p>Thinking back to the water demons they encountered on the river before, those were just missing fishermen. Obviously, their numbers were not enough, and even adding the few people in this rice shop wouldn’t make much difference.</p>
<p>If that’s the case, will Mu Ranwu continue to create closed places like the rice shop and curse more people?</p>
<p>Ranran considered if she were Mu Ranwu, where would she go next to continue to harm others.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, she couldn’t help but shudder. She just thought of QiongQi village which was full of people,</p>
<p>That village was secluded, out in the middle of nowhere. If the entire village was closed off, and everyone in it underwent a transformation, it would be a while before anyone would notice.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui also thought of this. After contemplating for a moment, he said mildly, “I shouldn’t have left an entry point for the village. I wonder if your old bestie understood what you said?”</p>
<p>If she believed Mu Ranwu’s dishonest rhetoric and opened the village gate for her, the entire village would be done for.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>In fact, shortly after Su Yi Shui and Xue Ranran left the village, Mu Ranwu already rushed to Qiongqi Village with her people in the night.</p>
<p>The entire village had people on duty at night to guard against water demons. But the person on duty recognized Mu Ranwu from when they were transporting limestone with Zhou Feihua. </p>
<p>Hearing she was here for a visit, they were not suspicious at all, immediately about to open the village gate and laying down wooden planks for them to enter.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu leisurely stood at the village gate, glanced disdainfully at the limestone-filled ditch, and calmly assessed the surroundings without any expression.</p>
<p>Just as Xue Ranran had anticipated, she was very satisfied with the remote terrain here. Even if the entire village underwent a transformation, there would be no contact with the outside world.</p>
<p>With Mu Qingge’s friendship with Zhou Feihua, she believed it would be easy to gain Zhou Feihua’s trust.</p>
<p>Although she could directly attack the village, wouldn’t it be easier to subdue these fishermen without any fuss?</p>
<p>Thinking like this, Mu Ranwu smiled and prepared to step into the village.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>However, to her surprise, the gate only opened a crack before it was immediately closed by a hand. It turned out that Zhou Feihua had arrived at the village gate at some point. She prevented the villagers on duty from opening the gate, just looked closely at the woman outside the fence, showing no joy of reunion.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu thought that Zhou Feihua who was hiding in this remote place, shouldn’t have heard the news of her true identity being exposed on Red Flame Mountain, so she smiled confidently and said, “When I saw you outside the town, I didn’t have time to talk to you. Now that I’m free, I came to Qiongqi village to look for you. How about it? Won’t you invite me into the village?”</p>
<p>At this moment, Zhou Feihua spoke, “I heard that you asked about Wang Suizhi’s whereabouts and mentioned he had betrayed the sect and done something rebellious. Have you… found him already?”</p>
<p>A hint of impatience flashed in Mu Ranwu’s eyes, but she smiled again, “Of course I have found him. If such a traitor is not punished, wouldn’t it set a bad example for other disciples?”</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua said, “Wang Suizhi is ambitious and greedy for silver. Before the Battle of Fanyao, he embezzled military funds, which shows his character. Such a treacherous disciple, you wouldn’t let him off lightly, right?”</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu knew that Wang Suizhi had once embezzled military funds and thus had a feud with Zhou Feihua’s father. So she sighed along with Zhou Feihua’s words, “I know he is worthless. Now he has dug his own grave. I have a way to deal with him… Feihua, how long more are we to chat across a ditch? Can you open the gate and let me in?”</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua’s face showed a hint of dark and unclear expression. Finally, she clasped her fists coldly and said, “It’s getting late, and the village has set a rule of not opening the village gate at night. As an outsider, it’s not appropriate for me to break the rules. Please go back first, and I will personally go to town and pay a visit tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu didn’t come here to socialize or meet friends. The assistants at the rice shop in town, including Wang Suizhi, might successfully undergo their transformation at noon on the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>By then, more than ten water demons would break out of the rice shop and jump into the water, causing panic throughout the town. Of course, she would not be returning.</p>
<p>Now, it was getting dark, and it will be *midnight soon, the best time for casting the talismans. So she didn’t want to waste time talking to Zhou Feihua anymore. She suddenly leaped up, intending to rush through the ditch fence and into the village.<br/>*夜半 称作子时 <em>11pm-1am</em></p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>However, she didn’t expect that when she leaped up, she would collide with an invisible spiritual shield, which immediately repelled her.</p>
<p>After Mu Ranwu was reborn, the reincarnation tree on the Jue peak had withered and died. She hadn’t benefited from the nourishment of the reincarnation tree, so her strength was not as strong as before.</p>
<p>Being rebounded by this domineering spiritual shield, she actually spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>
<p>She was in shock: Who had set up such a powerful spiritual shield here? Did they…. already know she was coming?</p>
<p>Actually Su Yi Shui had set up this spiritual shield before he left, to prevent the water demons from retaliating. However, he left a gap at the entrance of the village for the villagers to come and go daily. After all, people in the village still needed to go out during the day to make a living. Leaving only this one gap made it easier to guard.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu had unfortunately decided to cross the fence instead, and so she suffered a significant repulsion and was injured quite badly.</p>
<p>Knowing she couldn’t force her way through, she immediately let her eyes well up with tears, and said softly, “Feihua, what’s wrong with you? Have the water demons scared you so much that you don’t even recognize an old friend like me?”</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua stared at her face intently, saying clearly, “The actual truth of Wang Suizhi embezzling military funds back then, was probably only known to Mu Qingge and me. Even though he likes money, he is not a greedy person. When he embezzled the funds, it was to prevent Mu Qingge from participating in the battle. He has a special ability, he can see one’s fortune, and he can also see the life and death gates of people. When he saw that the area around Fanyao was Mu Qingge’s death gate, he came up with this plan, willingly bearing the blame of being greedy, just to stop Mu Qingge from going to Fanyao… He was right, Mu Qingge was indeed killed in the remote Jue mountain not far from Fanyao. At that time, he blamed himself for not having enough spiritual power to see the specific location, otherwise, he definitely could have saved his master…”</p>
<p>She then took a breath and smiled wryly, “Unfortunately, he didn’t know that it wasn’t that Mu Qingge did not believe in his words, but she was determined to change destiny even if it meant certain death! When Mu Qingge and I were drinking alone, she even joked that with such filial disciples, her life had not been in vain, but it’s a pity that the fate between master and disciples were too shallow. If there was another life, she will definitely teach them to achieve greatness… But now you hate Wang Suizhi so much, just because he took away a few newly recruited disciples… You are so petty, you are definitely not Mu Qingge!”</p>
<p>When she heard this, Mu Ranwu finally realized where she had made a mistake. She couldn’t help but burst into laughter, “Every single one of you, always talking about Mu Qingge this and Mu Qingge that? Alright, I know she’s the best, so perfect that it’s suffocating. She’s impeccable to her disciples, to her friends… But how did she treat me? I’m her sister by blood! She knew I wasn’t cut out for cultivation with such a mediocre foundation, but she dragged me into the world of cultivation. I’ve been ridiculed and looked down upon ever since!”</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">一把破剑   A LOUSY SWORD</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Mu Ranwu wiped the blood from the corner of her mouth and continued bitterly, “I could have gotten married and had children, lived a simple and happy life. But I was forcibly dragged and got a glimpse into another world of cultivating immortality. Do you know how inferior and miserable I felt at that time? With my apititude, when I am old and gray, my sister will still be youthful and beautiful, ascending to immortality with her enviable cultivation. By then, I would be left alone in the mortal world, dying in loneliness and despair! What did I do wrong? My sister wasn’t killed by my hands! She was the one who didn’t want to live. She willingly traded her life so that demonic Su Yi Shui could live! I just wanted to start over, to live well, is that not allowed?”</p>
<p>In the last few sentences, Mu Ranwu almost roared out in madness. The bloodstains at the corner of her mouth were still there, and under the flickering flames, she seemed to exude demonic vibes.</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua was also shocked by her mournful expression. Although she was angry, she didn’t know what to say.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>At that moment, a clear female voice sounded, “If you want to live, no one is stopping you. When you were reborn at the Rebirth tree, Su Yi Shui didn’t expose your lies and deception. But you wanted to advance yourself at the cost of harming others, stepping on bodies to climb your way up, what kind of unconscionable logic is that?”</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu turned her head and saw that Xue Ranran had walked out of the darkness, and the tall and handsome man beside her was none other than Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>He never left Xue Ranran’s side, still following her like a shadow? This girl, who is clearly not as attractive as herself, where did she get such great charm to captivate Su Yi Shui once again?</p>
<p>Making the aloof and proud Su Yi Shui submit to her, was another fixation of the reborn Mu Ranwu, but the mediocre Xue Ranran effortlessly achieved it.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu now felt resentment at the sound of her voice. She sneered, “So it was you who told Zhou Feihua, no wonder this village has a spiritual shield. How about it, big sister? Have you added another follower to your ranks? You must be feeling pleased?”</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua, upon hearing this, looked at Xue Ranran in disbelief: So this young girl who always had a good rapport with her… she’s her good friend Mu Qingge!</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui, had no patience for this imposter, especially after hearing her nonsensical words just now, he was utterly disgusted!</p>
<p>Even though he had forgotten many things, he still remembered how Mu Qingge had pampered this sister. But now, in Mu Ranwu’s words, it had all become Mu Qingge’s sins?</p>
<p>Such an ingrate, it would be no loss to kill her!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>With these thoughts, Su Yi Shui summoned his vitality qi and attacked Mu Ranwu.</p>
<p>Beside Mu Ranwu were those few strange men with dull expressions, all of them highly skilled. When Su Yi Shui fought them the last time, he had been at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>However, it had been **over a month since their last battle. During their journey, Su Yi Shui had been exchanging energy with Ranran during practice, and not only did her cultivation improve, so did his.</p>
<p>When Su Yi Shui and the five attendants fought together, Ranran also soared on her sword and fought alongside Su Yi Shui against the enemies.</p>
<p>The benefits of practicing together was immediately obvious in this intense battle. The two advanced and retreated, attacked and defended, their tacit understanding was as if they were twins. Even without eye contact, they could predict each other’s next move just from their energy fluctuations.</p>
<p>Under the bright torches in the village, the man’s long robes and wide sleeves fluttered like a dragon, and the woman was petite and delicate, with a slender waist and agile movements, exuding a thunderous and clear aura. Watching them, one would be entranced, completely forgetting that this was a tough fight for survival.</p>
<p>At that moment, Mu Ranwu, who had been hiding in the back, suddenly blew on an ancient xun around her neck. When the xun emitted a dull sound, more than a dozen water demons covered in scales surged out of the river surrounding the village and madly rushed towards them.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu knew that if things continued like this, Su Yi Shui and his disciple would eventually gain the upper hand. Her goal in coming here was to transform the entire village.</p>
<p>Now that Su Yi Shui and Xue Ranran were entangled in a battle with the others, their protective shield would naturally weaken, and they wouldn’t have the time to deal with so many water demons, which was a perfect opportunity for her to attack the village.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Unfortunately, she had forgotten to account for one person, and that was Zhou Feihua.</p>
<p>Although she didn’t have cultivation, she had followed her father and Mu Qingge through life and death, a female general who fought and killed on the battlefields.</p>
<p>Even in the face of a group of terrifying water demons, Zhou Feihua remained calm and collected. She ordered someone to beat the drum according to their usual training, waking everyone up and forming a tight defense around the fence.</p>
<p>When the water-drenched water demons entered the limestone pit and their bodies touched the limestone, they immediately began to steam and boil, becoming scorching hot. The water demons couldn’t help but let out piercing screams of agony.</p>
<p>However, when Mu Ranwu’s ancient xun sounded again, they appear to be controlled, continuing forward expressionlessly.</p>
<p>At that moment, the children in the village, at Zhou Feihua’s signal, started setting off firecrackers and banging on drums and gongs.</p>
<p>The cacophony of these noises disrupted the sound of the ancient xun, causing the water demons to retreat again, covering their ears in pain and trying to scatter in all directions.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu became worried. She squinted at the protective shield outside the village because earlier some water demons had attacked it, revealing the outline of the shield.</p>
<p>In a faint light, Mu Ranwu immediately noticed that the main gate of the village was not covered by the protective shield.</p>
<p>Casting a glance at Ranran and Su Yi Shui who were fighting the five Fan Tian cult attendants, Mu Ranwu narrowed her eyes and rushed towards the village gate.</p>
<p>Although some villagers did their best to stop her, how could they be a match for Mu Ranwu? They were immediately knocked flying and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua swung her long braid behind her and silently drew her sword from her waist, ready to engage Mu Ranwu. Mu Ranwu sneered and tried to grab the blade bare-handed, but when her hand touched Zhou Feihua’s sword, it was searing hot, causing her to scream and let go.</p>
<p>“What the hell is this sword?” Mu Ranwu looked at her rapidly festering hand and asked hatefully.</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua smiled coldly as she brandished *a sword flower and said coldly, “You can’t even recognize this sword? It’s the Jue Chen Sword that your sister used to wield.”<br/>*<em>the skillful and artistic technique of shaping a sword’s movements into a pattern resembling a flower, often used in martial arts or swordplay descriptions</em></p>
<p>Mu Ranwu took a closer look. Although the sword had a new handle and scabbard, the rusty sword body was indeed familiar!</p>
<p>Back then, her sister had always used this old sword she found in the ancient tomb on the Western Mountain. Later, Su Yu couldn’t stand to see it and bought another famous sword for her sister, decorated with jade and diamonds, exceptionally luxurious, and gave it to her sister.</p>
<p>At that time, Mu Qingge seemed reluctant to accept it, but under Su Yu’s insistence, she accepted the sword and then gave this lousy Jue Chen sword to her.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu felt extremely aggrieved at that time, thinking that Mu Qingge was throwing this unwanted junk at her. If her sister really wanted to give something, why not give her the precious sword given by Emperor Su Yu?</p>
<p>So, at that time, she smiled politely, with the excuse that she didn’t like violence and swords, and declined this junk.</p>
<p>After being reborn from the Rebirth Tree, she had remembered to ask Su Yu for the precious sword he gave to her sister, and she finally got her wish fulfilled.</p>
<p>She didn’t expect that Mu Qingge had actually given this sword to Zhou Feihua!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Speaking of the Jue Chen Sword, Zhou Feihua had used it for twenty years. Although she was no longer a youthful girl, she was at the prime age for a swordsman.</p>
<p>Over the years, the boring palace had become an excellent place for practice. So, in terms of swordsmanship, Zhou Feihua had already comprehended the essence of the Way of the swords.</p>
<p>She kept firmly in mind what her good friend had said when she gave her the Jue Chen Sword. “Although this sword looks old and worn, it’s a relic of an unnamed Sword Saint. He was obsessed with swordplay, and part of his spirit is imbued in the sword. If an ordinary person uses this sword, it’s just a rusty piece of metal. But if you accompany this sword for a long time and truly understand the essence of swordsmanship, this sword will come alive, and its power is not to be underestimated. Unfortunately, I haven’t delved deep enough into the study of swordsmanship, so I’ve let down this sword somewhat. I originally wanted my sister Xiaowu to practice with this sword. Her innate talent for cultivation is not high, but if she could practice swordsmanship, she could also achieve a saintly realm… Unfortunately, she said she didn’t like swordplay, so I’m gifting it to you. You won’t dislike it, will you?”</p>
<p>When Zhou Feihua picked up the sword at that time, she faintly felt the killing intent of the sword. So like a woman falling in love at first sight, she naturally accepted it gratefully.</p>
<p>In the following years, she held this broken piece of iron in countless nights in the deep palace, dancing with it in the morning and evening, cutting through the dew and snow.</p>
<p>Now, as Zhou Feihua held the sword in her hand, the rust on the sword slowly faded away, emitting a chilling brilliance, even forcing Mu Ranwu to retreat a few steps again.</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua said icily, “You always say that Mu Qingge neglected you, but she clearly gave you the best of everything right at the start. If you didn’t want it, who can you blame?”</p>
<p>With that, she attacked Mu Ranwu again, wielding the Jue Chen Sword, attacking tightly.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu couldn’t arrogantly grab the sword bare-handed anymore and had to set up her protective shield for defense. However, the sword was too strange. It could pierce through her true energy and came close towards Mu Ranwu.</p>
<p>She could only dodge awkwardly and use her sword in her hand to block, but with a crisp cracking sound, her sword was already cut into two like tofu by that lousy sword.</p>
<p>Next, sword energy rained down, attacking densely. Mu Ranwu was forced to retreat repeatedly until she stumbled and fell into the limestone pit.</p>
<p>By now, the limestone pit had been filled with water by the villagers and was boiling hot. Mu Ranwu was scalded like a fish in a net, jumping up quickly.</p>
<p>Looking down, her body was already covered in clusters of blisters, like toad eggs.</p>
<p>“Arghh—” Mu Ranwu let out an exasperated scream.</p>
<p>If she had been defeated by Su Yi Shui or Xue Ranran, she could still console herself that it was because her true qi was depleted during this period, so her skills became inferior.</p>
<p>But what was Zhou Feihua? A mere consort in Su Yu’s harem, an ordinary woman, used to relieve boredom!</p>
<p>She was actually beaten to such a miserable state by this woman and couldn’t even get close!</p>
<p>And when she saw the great power of the Jue Chen Sword in Zhou Feihua’s hands, Mu Ranwu realized what kind of treasure she had rejected years ago!</p>
<p>Under a mix of shame, regret, and resentment, she became bitter again: hateful sister, why didn’t she make things clear back then? It caused her to miss out on such a treasure, and now she was made so miserable by this sword!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:1px"></div>
<p>At this moment, Zhou Feihua had already flown over and joined the battle with Su Yi Shui and Xue Ranran.</p>
<p>The addition of the female Sword Master immediately changed the course of the battle, causing the five Fan tian attendants to gradually fall into a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu knew she wouldn’t gain anything here, so she decisively abandoned the five attendants and turned to run.</p>
<p>But Su Yi Shui had been keeping his eye on her, how could he let her escape so easily?</p>
<p>He swiftly pulled out a short blade from Ranran’s side and flung it out, piercing through Mu Ranwu’s shoulder, nailing her to a large tree.</p>
<p>And just then, the five attendants seemed to sense something and decided to sacrifice themselves to protect their leader, suddenly inflating their bodies like inflated skin bags.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui hurriedly shouted, “Retreat quickly! Keep your distance from them!”</p>
<p>After saying that, he extended his wide sleeves to protect Ranran and they leapt away from the five people.</p>
<p>In an instant, the bodies of those five people exploded, scattering into smoke and dust with the wind.</p>
<p>Ranran couldn’t understand the significance of their self-destruction. But when Mu Ranwu inhaled their remnants, her strength suddenly increased, breaking free from the short blade pinning her down, then left laughing maniacally.</p>
<p>Ranran noticed that her eyes were somewhat bloodshot, looking as if she had fallen into demonic path.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, the other water demons also fell one by one, struggling to crawl towards the riverbank, trying to escape.</p>
<p>At this time, the villagers from the village also came out with axes and hoes, ready to kill those struggling water demons.</p>
<p>But Ranran stopped them, saying, “No! They are the fishermen who went missing a few days ago. They have been cursed and lost their senses. We’ll try to find a way to save them…”</p>
<p>Just then, a white-haired old lady squeezed out from the crowd, tottering as she walked . She was Zhou Feihua’s landlord in the village where she was staying. Her sixteen-year-old grandson had disappeared while fishing by the river a few days ago.</p>
<p>Now, she painstakingly looked over these monsters, she spotted one of the severely burned water demons.</p>
<p>That water demon had a silver earring on his ear. Her missing grandson had been born after her son died, so she had pierced his ear with her own dowry earring to ward off evil and prevent premature death.</p>
<p>Although the old lady couldn’t recognize the person, she recognized her own dowry ear ring, so she burst into tears of grief.</p>
<p>But just as she was about to approach her grandson, she was almost scratched in the throat by his suddenly extended sharp claws, and his arm was already dripping with blood.</p>
<p>A villager shouted, “They are already possessed by evil spirits and are no longer human. Why keep them? We should just kill them while they are weak!”</p>
<p>Those with missing family members naturally disagreed, so the crowd erupted into arguments.</p>
<p>In the end, Zhou Feihua spoke up, “Enough! Stop quarreling. Although these people have been possessed by demons, they were once your neighbors. How can we give up on them without trying to help? There is a cave in the mountains behind the village. I will find a way to lock them in there and then try to help them return to normal.”</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua’s heroic demeanor just now had impressed everyone, and coupled with her leadership in defending the village against demons in recent days, she had already gained their respect. So when she spoke, everyone fell silent.</p>
<p>Ranran took out spirit charms to immobilize these water demons and gave them some mind clearing pills.</p>
<p>However, these pills didn’t seem to work on those already demonized. After ingesting them, they only felt nauseous and vomited green fluids.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When these water demons were tied up with ropes and taken to the cave in the mountains, those who had not completely transformed yet from the rice shop began to wail loudly again.</p>
<p>Watching those fully transformed monsters, the shopkeepers and attendants felt it was hopeless for them, thinking that they would rather die than become like that.</p>
<p>However, those few children who had fled from Mu Ranwu were surprisingly calmer than the adults. They were all orphans, begging on the streets before, and later became sacrificial lambs for Mu Demoness. Perhaps they had experienced too much hardship. Faced with such a terrifying situation, they seemed even more composed.</p>
<p>Wang Suizhi sighed heavily, looking at Zhou Feihua who had come over, “General Zhou, I didn’t expect to meet you again here. But I’m afraid my time is running out. Could I trouble you to pass on some last words to my wife and children? As for my master… could you try to persuade her not to do evil anymore…”</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua handed him some coarse bread and pickled vegetables brought from the village, then pointed to Xue Ranran who was treating the injured monsters and said, “Your master is right in front of you. If you have anything to say, you can tell her directly.”</p>
<p>Wang Suizhi just muttered “okay” at first, but when he figured out the meaning of Zhou Feihua’s words, he looked at Xue Ranran with eyes widening, “What… what does this mean?”</p>
<p>After Zhou Feihua explained how she saw through the imposter Mu Qingge, Wang Suizhi actually prostrated himself on the ground like a child, crying loudly, “I knew my master couldn’t have become so malicious! It turns out she was an imposter! That’s great! Master! Master! Your disciple is foolish, you wouldn’t abandon me right?”</p>
<p>Ranran never expected she would have to coax middle-aged bearded men not to cry. The scene was quite chaotic for a while, and when she finally calmed down Wang Suizhi, she asked, “Why isn’t Qin Xuanjiu with you?”</p>
<p>Wang Suizhi wiped the snot off his beard and pointed to a bruise on his eye that hadn’t completely disappeared, saying, “I got my junior brother drunk at the inn in Red Flame Mountain and brought him out. But when he woke up and heard what I said, he said I was suspicious of our master and beat me severely before leaving by himself. I don’t know if he will go look for that imposter again and continue to recognize a thief as his master…”</p>
<p>After talking with Wang Suizhi for a while, Ranran turned around and left the cave. At a glance, she saw Su Yi Shui sitting cross-legged on a large stone, meditating.</p>
<p>She didn’t want to disturb him, so she chose another hillside, looking at the bright moon in the sky, and let out a long sigh.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But before the sigh could end, someone approached from behind, asking in a deep voice, “Didn’t you already save everyone? Why are you sighing?”</p>
<p>Ranran looked up at the handsome man standing beside her, feeling lost and melancholic as she said, “I used to feel that I had no connection with my former disciples. I don’t even remember them anymore, so naturally, I couldn’t feel any master-disciple feelings for them, except for being somewhat familiar with fourteenth uncle master. So, after knowing my own background, when I saw Mu Ranwu deceiving them, I did not immediately reveal my identity. Now thinking back, I feel quite sorry towards them. Mu Ranwu has become radical and insane now. If anything happens to Qin Xuanjiu, I’m afraid I won’t forgive myself…”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui remained silent and didn’t speak. If he hadn’t lost his memory, he probably already known Ranran’s identity long ago.</p>
<p>But why did he allow that impostor to spread rumors and deceive others, surrounding herself with Mu Qingge’s former disciples and grand disciples?</p>
<p>In the past, Su Yi Shui probably couldn’t understand, but just now, when Wang Suizhi kowtowed to Xue Ranran and kept apologizing, calling her “Master” repeatedly, he couldn’t help feeling a wave of annoyance. It seemed like he couldn’t stand seeing Xue Ranran surrounded by a group of men…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Perhaps it was because of this inexplicable emotion that he couldn’t be bothered to expose the impostor, letting her spread rumors and deceive others, and incidentally attracting away those men who might be around Xue Ranran?</p>
<p>So, the main culprit should have been him, why would this girl take the blame upon herself?</p>
<p>But after turning over the words of apology on his tongue several times, Su Yi Shui still couldn’t bring himself to admit it was his fault. He just stiffly said, “If that Qin Xuanjiu really encounters danger, I will get him out… They are all grown men, *past their thirties. Shouldn’t they have eyes and brains of their own? Besides putting on a fake face, what resemblance does Mu Ranwu have to you? It’s their own blindness to mistaken her for you. What does it have to do with you?”<br/>*而立 <em>30 years old</em></p>
<p>Hearing this, Xue Ranran let out another deep sigh and looked at the tense man, *saying dejectedly “In my past life, I must have not thought it troublesome, to take on so many disciples. The good tempered ones are so few and most of them are so difficult. Did I end up dying from exhaustion in my past life… Hmmph…”<br/>*心有戚戚  《孟子·梁惠王上》夫子言之，于我心有戚戚焉。</p>
<p>She didn’t finish her words and was quickly silenced by the infuriated man who lowered his head and sealed her lips with his own.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui kissed her fiercely while thinking: She was indeed blind in her past life, and actually took in someone like him, who is two-faced and completely bad. But since she had accepted him, she couldn’t just shake him off whenever she wanted!</p>
<p>The bright moon hung high above, and after lingering for a moment as they sat on the large stone, the man and woman finally separated.</p>
<p>Ranran slowly leaned her head on the shoulder of the moody man, snuggling against him and quietly admiring the bright moon in the sky.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After settling everyone, Zhou Feihua, who had just come out of the cave, happened to see them from behind.</p>
<p>Although she still found Su Yi Shui displeasing, she also felt that the two of them seemed to have an entangled fate for several lifetimes. They couldn’t be separated even in life and death.</p>
<p>Hopefully, in this life as Xue Ranran, she wouldn’t have to bear too much responsibility anymore, and she could fulfill her wish to wander between the sky and the earth…</p>
<p>After this episode, the situation along the river seemed to have calmed down greatly, and no one else went missing for the time being. However, news of demons on the mountain behind the Qiongqi village continued to spread.</p>
<p>Although there were no reinforcements from the officials when they needed to drive away the demons, once they heard that the people of Qiongqi village had captured more than a dozen water demons, the officials immediately sent people to convey their instructions from above: “Our magistrate said that these evil creatures have been invaded by evil qi, and are beyond redemption. They must be burned with fire and let high monks recite sutras for their salvation. You ignorant villagers must not detain these evil creatures on your own, it’s better to hand them over quickly!”</p>
<p>The meaning of these constables’ words was straightforward—they wanted to quickly dispose of those demonized people.</p>
<p>Even though Su Yi Shui had sent a mountain sparrow with a talisman to deliver a message to Western Mountain, the distance was still far. Even if Elder Jiu rushed over quickly by riding on the wind, it would still take several days to arrive.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">探入龙岛  TO DRAGON ISLAND</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>However, these constables showed no sign of giving up unless the people were handed over. The village head, feeling helpless, discussed with Zhou Feihua and Su Yi Shui to see if they could hand over the people first and then deal with the situation. After all, these were government officials. Once offended, their livelihoods as commoners would be in jeopardy.</p>
<p>But before Zhou Feihua could speak, Su Yi Shui coldly interjected, “No, we can’t hand them over.”</p>
<p>Just one Qin Xuanjiu had already made that girl feel so guilty. If Wang Suizhi and the others were going to be burned alive, wouldn’t that girl blame herself to the point of not being able to eat?</p>
<p>So, without any hesitation, Su Yi Shui flatly refused.</p>
<p>Now, the villagers were all having different thoughts. Those who hadn’t lost loved ones who were turned into water demons were a bit dissatisfied, thinking that causing the entire village to offend the government for a few monsters was making life difficult for everyone.</p>
<p>Some even secretly went to inform the officials, subtly revealing that the water demons were in the cave on the back mountain.</p>
<p>When the officials led a large group of people to search for the water demons on the back mountain, Ranran and Su Yi Shui, who had just moved the transformed people away, were standing on the treetops, observing the villagers leading the officials.</p>
<p>Ranran noticed that one of them was actually the nephew of Zhou Feihua’s landlady.</p>
<p>On the day the village was attacked, the nephew was still busy running around about the landlady, but who could have thought the next day, he would eagerly lead the soldiers to arrest his own nephew.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui, however, wasn’t surprised. He sneered, “That family has only one heir, and the old woman’s husband’s family has no suitable descendants. If the old woman’s only grandson is gone, isn’t it just perfect for this nephew to step in?”</p>
<p>Although Ranran was clever, she never liked to think badly of people, which was the stark difference between her and Su Yi Shui. Perhaps Su Yi Shui, being a descendant of the royal family, was more sensitive and experienced in power struggles and internal conflicts with family.</p>
<p>After hearing Su Yi Shui’s words, Ranran took a deep breath and said in a low voice, “Sometimes, the line between humans and demons is very thin. Cultivating immortality is easy, but cultivating the heart is truly difficult…”</p>
<p>*Ranran said this unintentionally, but Su Yi Shui, as the former demon’s son, couldn’t help but cast a glance at her after hearing this.<br/>*说者无意听者有心 <em>the speaker may not intend a certain meaning, but the listener can interpret or understand it differently</em></p>
<p>Ranran knew what that glance meant but deliberately pursed her lips and said, “Hey, yes I’m talking about you! Even without your master, you should still cultivate diligently. You can’t frequently think about how to kill your mentor. I raised you with great effort, even if there are no merits, there are still hardships… aye…”</p>
<p>Before she could finish speaking, Su Yi Shui had grabbed the small bun on top of her head and started shaking it, instantly dispelling any trace of authority befitting a former master of Xishan.</p>
<p>Ranran could only hold onto his wrist, muttering softly in annoyance, “Stop it, my hair will get messy!”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui smiled through gritted teeth, “If you dare mention raising me again, don’t blame me for being impolite for real!”</p>
<p>He felt that he was now too indulgent with this little demoness, practically fallen under her spell. Whenever he was near her, he felt somewhat distracted, constantly wanting to stick close to her all the time. If this continued, before the soul-cleansing talisman could be undone, he wouldn’t be himself anymore.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui felt that he should be harsher with Xue Ranran and not be so clingy.</p>
<p>But now, her small bun was shaken loose by him, and a few strands of hair fell around her fair cheeks, looking… <em>pretty cute</em>.</p>
<p>By the time Su Yi Shui came back to his senses, he had already planted a kiss on her cheek, making Ranran feel a bit embarrassed. She whispered softly, “It’s broad daylight, this isn’t quite appropriate…”</p>
<p>With a dark expression, Su Yi Shui stood up and swiftly left, preparing to go to the back mountain to teach a few unlucky fellows a lesson and divert his attention.</p>
<p>Could this loss of self-control, also be a side effect of the soul-cleansing talisman? He needed to be vigilant and not let himself yield.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran was unaware of her dear former disciple’s inner turmoil. She only knew that a mysterious heroic immortal had disposed of the officials and villagers who had gone to the back mountain, tossing them into a ditch.</p>
<p>Especially the nephew who had eagerly led the way, he was thrown into the manure pit for the villagers’ compost heap.</p>
<p>For now, those officials returned empty-handed. But given the local officials’ enthusiasm for hindsight criticism, it was likely that those relocated individuals wouldn’t remain hidden for long.</p>
<p>Fortunately, within a few days, Yuchen and Yutong arrived in Qiongqi Village with Elder Jiu.</p>
<p>Elder Jiu, with a wine gourd in his mouth, carefully examined the transformed Wang Suizhi.</p>
<p>Although he had been continuously taking Clear Heart Pills, the transformation couldn’t be stopped. In the past few days, his pupils had gradually elongated, and he occasionally lost control of his mind.</p>
<p>Elder Jiu nodded, and Ranran thought he had a solution, so she asked, “Elder, how can we save them?”</p>
<p>Elder Jiu honestly replied, “I currently have no way!”</p>
<p>“Then why did you nod?”</p>
<p>Elder Jiu looked on admiringly and said, “This Seven Evil Transformation Talisman is even purer and more powerful than what was discovered at Wangxiang River. Very impressive!”</p>
<p>Ranran couldn’t help but laugh wryly and said in a small voice, “He’s my disciple from my past life, you have to find a way to save him!”</p>
<p>Elder Jiu now knew that this little girl was his actual drinking buddy from twenty years ago. After hearing his little buddy’s request, he said earnestly, “Have you seen their scales? They are *Jiao dragon scales, not from ordinary water creatures. They have transformed so many people, they probably used Jiao dragon’s blood as a catalyst. If you can find something to counteract its blood… like Green Dragon blood, maybe I can try something.”<br/>*蛟<em> is the water dragon which Su Yi Shui took its molt and killed by Wei Jiu</em></p>
<p>Ranran furrowed her brow in thought; Elder Jiu was right. She had read in ancient texts before that a Jiao dragon, lacking tail and horns, spent its life to transform into a true dragon. If there were something to suppress the Jiao dragon blood, it would be Green Dragon’s blood.</p>
<p>But a Green Dragon was extremely rare. Even the dragon she and Su Yi Shui had rescued in the palace was just an ordinary small dragon. The blood of a vermilion bird was hard to come by, let alone dragon blood, which was like searching for a needle in a haystack.</p>
<p>However, this was the only way to save these transformed people. Ranran looked at the unconscious Wang Suizhi and resolved to give it a try.</p>
<p>When she told Su Yi Shui her plan, he frowned and said, “Dragon Island is a forbidden land for mortals. No one has ever entered or left there. Are you sure you want to go there to find Green Dragon’s blood and ask it of a bowl of blood?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui looked at her with a strange expression, recognizing in her this unyielding spirit of defying heaven and earth, fearless of life and death, is truly worthy of being Mu Qingge’s reincarnation. Only she would have such an unconventional idea, wanting to go to Dragon Island and meet her end.</p>
<p>With knitted brows he said, “Think carefully, neither I nor the disciples of Xishan will accompany you on this fool’s errand to die on Dragon Island!”</p>
<p>Ranran nodded decisively and said, “… I know someone on the island. I’ll just give it a try. But I will go alone, you don’t have to accompany me.”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>She really did not want Su Yi Shui to go with her. So that same night, she had packed a small bundle and quietly left the village by herself.</p>
<p>When she came to a mountain hollow to fetch water to drink, she sensed someone following behind.</p>
<p>Without a word, she went to a flat area, swiftly jumped onto a tree and looked back. When their eyes met, it turned out to be Su Yi Shui staring at her from below the tree…</p>
<p>“Why are you here too?” Xue Ranran asked in surprise.</p>
<p>Because he had already made it clear that he would never accompany her to Dragon Island. At dinner, he had even instructed Yuchen and Yutong to prepare to return to Xishan.</p>
<p>Leaving quietly like this, was to not make things difficult for him, so she left without saying goodbye.</p>
<p>With a serious expression, Su Yi Shui said, “Have you forgotten? You have half of my golden core in you. How could I let you take my cultivation to feed a dragon?”</p>
<p>By now, Ranran had figured out Su Yi Shui’s aggravating teenage temperament. He always had to bring up that half of the golden core every few days.</p>
<p>Actually, if he truly didn’t trust her with it, taking it back would be as easy as turning his hand. Yet every time, he only thundered threats without following through. So, facing this paper tiger that only roared but never showed its claws, she just had to coax him and offer him a graceful way to back down.</p>
<p>Ranran smiled and jumped down from the tree, grabbing Su Yi Shui’s arm and gave it a sway. “Alright, I got it. I will definitely take good care of your things. I will be very, very careful so I can return it without damage in future. Shifu, the scenery on the East Sea is so beautiful, and the freshly caught fish are really delicious. But this time, without the vermilion bird, we can rent a boat. Last time out on the sea, we lacked some oil, salt, and seasoning. Let’s bring some rice, noodles, and soybeans; we can stew the fish nicely.”</p>
<p>The gourmet’s train of thought always clearly planned what could be eaten next.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui had now also figured this little demoness out. If he upset her, she would call him “Hey.” But when she was happy, she would call him “Shifu.”</p>
<p>When extremely unhappy, she would raise her eyebrows and call him “Shui’er.”</p>
<p>But when she looked up at him and called him “Shifu”, that term was truly sweet sounding.</p>
<p>So, rushing to Dragon Island to become dragon food, became something to look forward to. Xue Ranran had this ability to turn a life-threatening journey into an incredibly leisurely outing.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Following behind Su Yi Shui, were Yutong, Gao Cang, Bai Baishan and Qiu Xier.</p>
<p>Since there were many people, they would need a large boat. Yutong specially rented a big boat at the pier, which could not only carry rice, noodles, and beans but also a potted orange tree. With diligent watering, they could pick oranges every few days.</p>
<p>Because Zhou Feihua had to take care of the demonized villagers, she didn’t come along. Helping her were Yuchen and Elder Jiu.</p>
<p>This was Gao Cang and Qiu Xier’s first time out at sea and they were rearing to go.</p>
<p>Seeing more and more people gathering, Xue Ranran couldn’t help but worry for them. She solemnly reminded them, “Senior brothers and sisters, we’re heading to the forbidden land of Dragon Island. It’s even more dangerous than Tianmai Mountain and Red Flame Mountain. Are you really sure you want to go?”</p>
<p>Nowadays, the disciples of Xishan were all experienced in facing daunting challenges, and even Qiu Xier was no longer the frightened little greenhorn crying by Wangxiang River.</p>
<p>After hearing the sincere reminder from her junior-no its former grandmaster, Qiu Xier said seriously, “Don’t worry, we won’t be landing on Dragon Island. We’ll only stay outside and guard the ship for you, dear elder.”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran playfully pulled Qiu Xier’s braid and said, “I’m clearly younger than you, yet you call me Elder!”</p>
<p>Qiu Xier grinned and said animatedly, “I always wondered why little junior sister is so much more outstanding than us. It turns out you’re the reincarnation of our Grandmaster! Now, we’re all confident again!”</p>
<p>Although they had entered Xishan together for cultivation, Xue Ranran had surpassed the three of them and emerged as a new force, leaving them far behind. Although their bond was strong with the four of them, there was occasionally still a hint of desolation in their hearts.</p>
<p>But now things were different. Xue Ranran was their grandmaster, so being outstanding was only natural. Even if this was made known, it brought them high spirits. The old plaque at Xishan’s gate, which had remained unchanged for so long, now looked more eye-catching.</p>
<p>Moreover, this trip was not joined by the disciples who were recruited later. Instead, they were the ones Shifu have brought along, which was enough to see that even though he had lost his memory, he was gradually recognizing their abilities.</p>
<p>So even if they were on a large boat, on their way to become food for dragons, they could still feel a faint sense of superiority.</p>
<p>After the large boat entered the sea, it didn’t rely on sails but on Su Yi Shui’s spiritual energy to drive it, making it much faster than ordinary boats.</p>
<p>As Ranran said, as they sailed along the waves, and fished at the stern while surrounded by seabirds was indeed very pleasant.</p>
<p>When they reached the island where they had rested for a few days before, Ranran pointed out to Su Yi Shui, hoping to evoke some remaining memories.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even though they landed on the island, Su Yi Shui still couldn’t remember anything even when he looked at the firewood ash in the cave.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Soon, the boat arrived at the boundary of Dragon Island’s barrier.</p>
<p>One moment it was clear skies, but at the boundary, there were fierce winds, heavy rain, and rough waves.</p>
<p>When they focused on the dense clouds, it seemed like there was a terrifying beast hiding in them, silently observing the outsiders on the boat.</p>
<p>In the various legends of the cultivation world, there seemed to be no story of anyone surviving after entering Dragon Island.</p>
<p>So even after searching through ancient texts, there was no experience to draw from in this regard.</p>
<p>At this moment, Su Yi Shui instructed Yutong to bring a package containing two tight-fitting suits that resembled clothing for infiltration.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, one would see that the clothes were covered with fine black scales.</p>
<p>“When I ventured into Tianmai Mountain in the past, I *killed a black Jiao dragon whose skin has a water-repelling effect. After entering the water, it will automatically separate the water, allowing even those unfamiliar with swimming to move freely. I made two suits with this skin so that we don’t have to expend spiritual energy to part the water and they are also protective as they are weapons resistant as well.”<br/>*<em>huh? So did writer mix up because according to that Medicine Immortal imposter he only took its skin?</em></p>
<p>Ranran obediently changed into one. However, after she changed, she noticed Su Yi Shui staring at her without saying a word.</p>
<p>Ranran looked down… Hmm, it was slightly tight. She was a grown woman now, and this attire revealed her curves and accentuated  her slender waist…</p>
<p>Just as she was considering whether to change back, Su Yi Shui draped a cloak over her shoulders. “There are still Gao Cang and other men outside. Wear this for now, take it off when we land on the island…”</p>
<p>Hmm… Ranran couldn’t help but glance at him sideways. Would there be no men on Dragon Island later? Wasn’t he going with her?</p>
<p>Even though it would be dangerous going ahead, Yutong planned to follow the Master and Ranran. So, she had also changed into a swimming attire early, ready to go along.</p>
<p>The three of them prepared to cross the barrier of Dragon Island. Initially, it went smoothly, but soon Yutong was swiftly bounced back by the barrier, like a ball thrown back into the sea.</p>
<p>However, even though Su Yishui and Xue Ranran felt a slight resistance, they were able to pass through the barrier smoothly.</p>
<p>So they had Yutong swim back to the ship and wait, then both dived into the deep sea, avoiding the stormy weather on the surface.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When they resurfaced, they had crossed the barrier of Dragon Island, and it seemed like all the wind and high waves had stopped.</p>
<p>It was said that in ancient times, dragons had done evil, so the ancient gods sealed them on Dragon Island.</p>
<p>Therefore, although occasionally there were young dragons with low spiritual power sneaking out during their molting period, once the dragon reached maturity and its power increased, it was almost impossible to leave the island.</p>
<p>As for outsiders, they couldn’t sneak in to steal dragon eggs because they couldn’t break through the barrier. After all, Dragon Island was meant to protect the people of the human realm; how could they be allowed in?</p>
<p>So it was puzzling how Su Yi Shui and Xue Ranran could enter so easily.</p>
<p>However, when they reached the muddy beach and saw the skeleton of a water Jiao dragon, Su Yi Shui guessed the reason why they could land on the island. The Dragon Island barrier only prevented people from entering and dragons from leaving but didn’t stop dragon’s prey from entering the island.</p>
<p>Looking at the white bones of the water dragon, especially the spine that seemed to be crushed by a giant mouth, Su Yi Shui frowned deeply and said, “*You mentioned that I killed a black dragon when I was in Tianmai Mountain. Then I must have eaten a water dragon’s heart that enhances power. And you have also had water dragon molt water, so your aura must have changed.”<br/>*<em>what??? LOL oh writer</em>…</p>
<p>Ranran understood.<br/>*<em>but we don’t understand writer</em> </p>
<p>To dragons, a water dragon was like an appetizing fried loach. Plus, they were wearing clothes made from water dragon skin. So the barrier automatically recognized them as appetizers for dragons and allowed them in.</p>
<p>After understanding this, they weren’t as pleased anymore. Ranran suddenly remembered how the little dragon she once saved always peeked out of the sea with its eye, looking at her with ill-intentions.</p>
<p>Back then, she thought it was because it had eaten people before and couldn’t shake off the habit. Now, thinking about it, it was probably because her water dragon scent was too tempting, making that little dragon have a craving.</p>
<p>Although there were no dragons visible on Dragon Island at the moment, the intimidating and intermittent roar of dragons reminded them that there was more than one dragon on the island.</p>
<p>Ranran thought and asked, “Shouldn’t we retreat first and find a way to get rid of the water dragon scent on us?”</p>
<p>Back in the palace, dealing with a small dragon already caused them a lot of trouble. Now, going to the dragon’s territory bringing their own fragrance was truly seeking death.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Su Yi Shui quickly took off his water dragon suit, revealing his well-built upper body, and said to Ranran, “You should take off your water dragon skin too…”</p>
<p>What? Since this clothing was close-fitting, Ranran’s dressing order was similar to Su Yi Shui’s. If she took it off too, this pair of master and disciple of two lifetimes would be exposed before each other, and could end up being devoured naked by a dragon together… Just thinking about the scenario was offensive to the eyes!<br/>*坦诚相见 <em>here means naked lol</em></p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>So she very firmly shook her head.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui didn’t insist, he just said briefly, “It’s too late…”</p>
<p>Just as they were speaking, the ground on the island suddenly shook and churned, and something massive rushed towards them.</p>
<p>Both of them jumped up simultaneously, narrowly avoiding the dragon mouth that burst out of the ground.</p>
<p>Obviously, they encountered an Earth Dragon, eager to devour the two “loach” appetizers.</p>
<p>Ranran quickly remembered various dragon attributes she had read in ancient beast books and reminded Su Yi Shui, “Earth dragons are blind; they mainly rely on sound and scent for detection. It’s going to be difficult for us to shake it off.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Su Yi Shui immediately wielded his sword and attacked the Earth Dragon’s nose. Since it was blind, then they could disable its nose and ears.</p>
<p>As long as it couldn’t smell or hear, they could easily get rid of it.</p>
<p>His sword was incredibly fast and immediately chopped off half of the dragon’s nose, stirring up the Earth Dragon’s nest.</p>
<p>In its agonizing roar, more Earth Dragons emerged from the ground, seemingly countless, coming to assist.</p>
<p>Ranran quickly glanced around and was disappointed to find that despite luring out so many dragons, not a single one was a Green Dragon.</p>
<p>They had no idea if the Earth Dragons’ blood was going to be of any use. But at this rate, she and Su Yi Shui might really perish on Dragon Island…</p>
<p>With the situation critical, there was no time for her to think too much. She could only stand side by side with Su Yi Shui and face the constantly emerging Earth Dragons together.</p>
<p>During the struggle, Ranran’s ankle was suddenly entangled by an Earth Dragon’s tail, pulling her straight down. Su Yi Shui quickly rushed over to cut with his sword,</p>
<p>But although the Earth Dragon’s nose was soft, its body was extremely hard, especially the tail, which was a sharp tool for the Earth Dragon to dig underground with. Su Yi Shui couldn’t cut through it.</p>
<p>Seeing Ranran about to be dragged into the hole by the Earth Dragon, Su Yi Shui decided to jump into the hole with her.</p>
<p>Once in the ground, it would be the domain of these burrowing dragons, and they would have almost no chance of survival.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Just then, a roar of a dragon suddenly sounded, and a pale golden dragon leaped out of the sea.</p>
<p>As the majestic dragon roared, Ranran’s ankle was suddenly released from the entangling tail, and all the Earth Dragons seemed to be suppressed, obediently lying on the ground.</p>
<p>Some even timidly retreated back into their holes, only showing half of their dragon heads.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui steadied Ranran in time, and the two landed on a large reef on the island, looking up at the golden dragon hovering in mid-air.</p>
<p>As the golden dragon danced in the sky, the entire Dragon Island suddenly became eerily quiet, as if all the dragons were silent.</p>
<p>Ranran whispered, “Is it… the king of dragons?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui looked up at the dragon and said, “I don’t know, but it’s probably a mother, there’s a young dragon on its tail…”</p>
<p>Ranran looked closer and indeed, there was a smaller dragon coiled around the tail of the golden dragon.</p>
<p>However, that dragon… why did it look so familiar?</p>
<p>As Ranran was squinting, the little dragon slipped off the big dragon’s body, emitting a smooth, slightly coquettish squeak, and then flew towards Ranran with its dragon beard fluttering.</p>
<p>At this moment, Ranran finally recognized this little dragon. It was the one she and Su Yi Shui rescued from the palace.</p>
<p>Compared to back then, this little dragon had obviously grown a lot, but it looked relatively smaller when it was next to the big golden dragon.</p>
<p>But as its dragon eyes sparkled as it flew towards her, its intentions were unclear. Ranran couldn’t tell if it was here to reminisce or to hunt?</p>
<p>However, the dragon clearly sensed their vigilance and stopped in time, only playfully stepping on the head of the Earth Dragon lying on the ground with its dragon claw.</p>
<p>Then it shook its tail and jumped back into the sea. It then threw a few large fatty fish onto the ground before Ranran.</p>
<p>Although dragons were fierce, they hadn’t learned the hypocrisy and cunning of the human world.</p>
<p>So this act of actively offering fish was full of goodwill, to make a friendly gesture towards Ranran and Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>Ranran breathed a sigh of relief. It felt really good to encounter a familiar dragon in dragon territory on Dragon Island!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>
<p>Who would have thought someone so cold and formidable like Su Yi Shui would be such a 恋爱脑, so love-struck when he fell in love? <br/>Seeing him fight against his own inclinations is really entertaining!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Regarding the case of whether Su Yi Shui had killed the black water dragon or not… <br/>I guess we may only know in the drama… The novel writer is the unreliable narrator lol <br/>I was wondering if the writer wanted to distinguish between Su Yi Shui and Wei Jiu, which was why the imposter said that he did not kill the black water dragon. However why would Ranran tell Su Yi Shui another version compared to the one the imposter told her? Writer seems confused lol</p>
<p>*shrugs*</p>

<p>Ranran said smiling to the little dragon, “What, do you want me to grill fish for you again?”</p>
<p>Back when Ranran was healing on the island, she also adjusted the little dragon’s tastes, grilling fish for it to eat. At that time, the little dragon had eaten with its dragon beard raised, looking very satisfied.</p>
<p>So when Ranran said this, the little dragon made another sharp coquettish sound, then turned to the golden dragon in the sky and made several calls, as if also strongly recommending the taste of grilled fish to it.</p>
<p>However, the golden dragon remained suspended in the air, looking down at the two people on the large stone with endless dignity and indifference.</p>
<p>Ranran clasped her fists and respectfully said to the golden dragon, “I am Xue Ranran from Xishan. I have come here with a request…”</p>
<p>After she said this, the golden dragon suddenly flipped in the air and let out another roar.</p>
<p>Next, all the dragons on Dragon Island began to roar, even the little dragon opened its mouth and let out a loud cry, shaking the sky with thunderous sounds.</p>
<p>Ranran and Su Yi Shui had to use their true vitality as shields to barely withstand the roars from all the dragons.</p>
<p>Amidst this earth-shattering dragon’s roar, the golden dragon suddenly emitted a faint golden light all over its body, turning into a huge sphere of water vapor.</p>
<p>When the mist dissipated, Ranran realized that the golden dragon had transformed into a woman with long golden hair and golden clothes all over her body. However, the dragon horns on her head had not completely disappeared, indicating that she was not an ordinary mortal.</p>
<p>Although there were legends in ancient times about divine beasts undergoing heavenly tribulations and transforming into human forms, such miracles were distant legends. </p>
<p>Yet today on Dragon Island, she could witness a real transformation of a dragon into a human, which made this trip already worthwhile.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran looked carefully at this goddess who could transform into a human form. She was not stunningly beautiful, but carried an aura of majesty. It was a pity that there was a hideous scar on her face, extending from her cheek to her neck.</p>
<p>Without this scar, she would have been an elegant beauty.</p>
<p>As the goddess descended slowly, her eyes glowing with a faint golden color as she stared at Ranran and then at Su Yi Shui. Finally, she spoke to Ranran, “Your life force is not like an ordinary person’s. It seems you are someone who has died and been reborn?”</p>
<p>Ranran had come with a request, so she couldn’t lie. She replied honestly, “Twenty years ago, my soul scattered and was guided to the Tree of Rebirth, where I was reborn. May I ask the name of the goddess?”</p>
<p>The golden dragon said mildly, “I am a dragon, so I don’t have a name. I am the guardian god of Dragon Island. You can call me as you wish.”</p>
<p>At this moment, the goddess turned her head to look at Su Yi Shui. Her eyes, glowing with a faint golden color, could see through people’s past lives.</p>
<p>But when she saw Su Yi Shui, her brows furrowed even tighter. “You were born with the Emperor’s Fire element destiny, but your evil star is in the palace, indicating a natural born tyrant with a lonely fate, the former son of darkness… and yet someone has changed your fate chart, forcefully adding planet Mercury’s water to extinguish the fire, leaving a chance for survival… What kind of chaotic fate chart is this?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui knew by now that Mu Qingge had tampered with his fate chart all those years ago, but being told by a dragon that his originally fine emperor fate chart had been all messed up, he couldn’t help but glare at Ranran.</p>
<p>Ranran pretended not to see, and quickly changed the subject abruptly, pointing to the little dragon cuddling against the golden-haired woman’s feet and asked tentatively, “Is it your child?”</p>
<p>The golden dragon furrowed her brows slightly, saying resignedly, “It has no mother. After coming to Dragon Island, I don’t know why, but it took me as its mother and I just couldn’t shake it off.”</p>
<p>Everything now clicked for Ranran, so its her godson… A child from their own family always looks better, and since Ranran had rescued this little dragon, she naturally found it cute and lively like it was her nephew.</p>
<p>When it had first arrived on Dragon Island, it already knew to acknowledge the local dragon leader as its godmother. Such cleverness deserved a basket of grilled fish.</p>
<p>Regardless, perhaps due to the goodwill from saving their dragon kin by these two, the goddess did not immediately bring up the matter of them cutting off the earth dragon’s nose. She only asked, “You two have intruded into the forbidden area of the dragon clan. What exactly do you want?”</p>
<p>Ranran did not hide anything and said sincerely, “There are people in the territory of Daqi who are poisoned by the water dragon. We need the blood of the Green dragon from Dragon Island to save them. Can the goddess accommodate us and allow us to take some dragon blood back…”</p>
<p>Initially, the goddess’s expression was indifferent, but when she heard Ranran mention the Green Dragon, her expression slowly became terrifyingly fierce. She suddenly reached out and attacked Ranran!</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui remained calm as he stood by the side, but had been on guard against this guardian god of Dragon Island.</p>
<p>When he saw her suddenly attacking Ranran, Su Yi Shui immediately summoned his spiritual shield to block. However, the goddess’s power was too powerful. She easily sent Su Yi Shui flying.</p>
<p>When Su Yi Shui’s body hit a boulder, the tremendous force even shattered the boulder behind him.</p>
<p>This was the difference between a god and a human. Even though Su Yi Shui was exceptionally talented and had high cultivation, without ascending and crossing the tribulation, he had not reached the level of a god.</p>
<p>Now, he was like an ant compared to this guardian god of Dragon Island, completely incomparable.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the little dragon had been clinging to the goddess’s ankle and let out a low cry in time, causing her to exert slightly less force. Otherwise, it would not have been difficult for her to shatter Su Yi Shui’s soul.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>However, Su Yishui quickly stood up, glaring at the goddess coldly. He suddenly drew out a golden-glowing club from his body.</p>
<p>The goddess furrowed her brows slightly. “The Dragon-Subduing Club… You actually have such a divine object?”</p>
<p>“This is the last Dragon-subduing Club left by the former god after driving the dragons into the island, left in the human realm. Do you want to try it?” Su Yi Shui said with a dark expression.</p>
<p>Although she was a goddess, with this Dragon-subduing Club, he could still fight her. He had Yu Tong bring this precious treasure from Xishan as a precaution for just such a situation. If the golden loach wanted a fight, he would fight her to the end.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran flew to Su Yi Shui’s side, protecting him with her body. If the golden dragon goddess attacked again, she could block it for Su Yi Shui. At the same time, she also realized that she must have said something wrong just now, quickly smiling and trying to smooth things over, “Why resort to such force? It’s just a misunderstanding. The goddess looks benevolent and kind. Why would she make things difficult for us? Although we trespassed into the forbidden area, we had no evil intentions and have not come to take the life of the Green dragon. We just hope to obtain some blood to save people. Please calm down, goddess.”</p>
<p>Her voice was clear and sincere, with a hint of likable charm, looking much less aggressive than Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>The little dragon cuddling the goddess let out a hmpph hmmpph with its nose, coaxing its godmother, whining softly for a while. It’s unclear what it said, but it finally calmed down the goddess.</p>
<p>However, her tone remained cold, “Using the blood of the Green dragon to dispel evil curses? Who taught you this method?”</p>
<p>Ranran continued respectfully, “I wonder if the goddess knows about the Elder Jiu of Cuiwei Mountain. He is a master at making talismans, and this was the only method he could come up with.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, the expression of the goddess became even more peculiar, but it didn’t seem like anger. Instead, it was a mixture of astonishment and understanding.</p>
<p>“The Wine Immortal? Does he have an older brother who ascended to immortality?”</p>
<p>Ranran was surprised. She didn’t expect the guardian god of Dragon Island to know an old drunkard from outside the island!</p>
<p>So she honestly replied, “Yes, his older brother is the Medicine Immortal, who has successfully ascended and is ranked among the immortals… When did the goddess meet him?”</p>
<p>The goddess said mildly, “A long time ago, I have also went out of the island, and met some people…”</p>
<p>Ranran was somewhat puzzled and asked in a low voice, “As the guardian god of Dragon Island, can you also leave the island?”</p>
<p>The goddess gently touched the scar on her face and said softly, “Every dragon can leave the island, as long as they can pay the corresponding price… When the mother of this little dragon left the island to help her friend, she paid with her life and could never return to Dragon Island. I also paid with five hundred years of my cultivation and this scar on my face…”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>She seemed unwilling to continue and changed the subject, “…You two once saved my dragon kin, so you should not be wicked people. However, your wish this time may be in vain, because… there is no more Green dragon on Dragon Island!”</p>
<p>When she said this, Ranran was at a loss. Dragon Island was sealed by the former god as the dragon clan’s territory. If there were no Green dragons on Dragon Island, where could they find them?</p>
<p>“May I ask where the Green dragon has gone?”</p>
<p>The goddess glanced at them and said, “Follow me…”</p>
<p>Ranran was about to step forward, but Su Yi Shui stopped her. This goddess seemed unpredictable. If they followed her, it could be good or bad.</p>
<p>Ranran channeled a message to him “Either way, we can’t beat her. Whether we die on the edge of the island or in the center, it doesn’t make much difference. Let’s just follow her.”</p>
<p>Although her words made sense, Su Yi Shui felt like her words implied that he was weak and couldn’t beat a golden loach… the man’s expression darkened a bit.</p>
<p>He had been originally influenced by his father, and was more focused on worldly gains. But now his life had been completely changed by his good mentor, and maybe due to losing some memories, his former competitive spirit and desire to win seemed to have diminished somewhat.</p>
<p>However, when he was just now completely overwhelmed by this golden dragon’s absolute strength, that competitive spirit seemed to return… He wasn’t strong enough yet, not strong enough to kill gods… He needed to become stronger…</p>
<p>Thinking like this, faint runes appeared again on Su Yi Shui’s forehead, but they quickly disappeared.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran didn’t look back, and did not notice the anomaly on Su Yi Shui’s forehead. She just pulled him along to follow the goddess, and they soon arrived at a valley in the center of the island. Although sunlight spilled in, the valley remained gloomy, with an aura of death which can’t be dispersed.</p>
<p>“This is the place of dragon demise. Although dragons can live for thousands of years or even ten thousand years, occasionally some dragons die during the three-hundred-year tribulation due to insufficient cultivation. Their skeletons are all here. The Green dragon you’re looking for… is over there.”</p>
<p>There were dozens of dragon bones of various sizes arranged in the deep valley. But the dragon body the goddess pointed to was different, as the bones still had dragon skin on them.</p>
<p>However, the once shiny Green dragon skin was now dull and dry. The most eerie part was that the dragon skin clung tightly to the bones, as if it had been drained by some creature.</p>
<p>At this moment, the goddess said coldly, “The Green dragon you’re looking for has long been sucked dry of its dragon blood and died. There are no more Green dragons in the world.”</p>
<p>Ranran was shocked, realizing why the goddess had reacted so angrily when she mentioned taking the Green dragon’s blood.</p>
<p>“Who did this? Ordinary people can’t come to Dragon Island, right?”</p>
<p>The goddess smiled coldly, “I was in seclusion at the time and submerged deep in the sea. When I sensed something wrong and came back up, the Green dragon had already been sucked dry and died. Ordinary people indeed cannot come here, but Dragon Island can block people, but not gods. The one who can slaughter dragons on Dragon Island without anyone knowing must be a deity!”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui frowned, “Dragons are natural spiritual creatures. Killing a spirit dragon is a serious crime that incurs divine punishment. Which deity would knowingly commit such a crime?”</p>
<p>**The Green dragon is the god of the East, symbolizing the *Spring. Its blood not only has rejuvenation effects but is also said to revive the soul.<br/>*少阳 </p>
<p>However, these are just legends, unconfirmed by anyone, and it’s almost impossible for anyone to obtain Green dragon blood. It’s unbelievable that a deity would offend the dragon god and commit such a cruel act, draining the blood from the entire Green dragon.</p>
<p>What is the purpose behind this, is both puzzling and chilling.</p>
<p>The goddess said coldly, “If I find out who it is, even if they are an ancient deity, they will be torn apart by my dragon clan. If you have no other business, please leave Dragon Island as soon as possible. Otherwise, the scent of the water dragon on you is too tempting. Once the dragon horde loses control, I’m afraid you won’t be able to leave even if you want to.”</p>
<p>But Ranran was unwilling to give up and asked loudly, “Please, can the goddess guide me on how to break the Seven Evil Transformation Seal without the blood of the Green dragon?”</p>
<p>The goddess shook her head and then thought for a moment before saying mildly, “Actually, there is another person who should have the blood of the Green dragon. I just don’t know if he has any dragon blood left…”</p>
<p>Ranran asked curiously, “Who is it?”</p>
<p>The goddess paused and said, “It’s the elder brother of your friend—now the Medicine Immortal who has ascended to the lower god realm. He is obsessed with alchemy and loves to collect various rare medicinal materials. I remember that although he didn’t enter Dragon Island back then, he used the talismans given by his younger brother to drive two water rats into Dragon Island. While the Green dragon was fast asleep, he took a few drops of dragon blood.”</p>
<p>As she spoke, the goddess didn’t show regret for letting a thief into her home; instead, her tone carried a sense of melancholy, as if recalling the past.</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal? Ranran now knew that the person she met on Tianmai Mountain was an impostor. But where to find the Medicine Immortal who has ascended, would be another problem.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Moreover, the people from the Qiongqi Village couldn’t wait until they found the Medicine Immortal either.</p>
<p>However, the goddess said mildly, “If I’m not mistaken… Every Qixi Festival, he will place thousands of lotus lanterns along the banks of the Lijiang River. It seems tomorrow happens to be Qixi Festival. I wonder if he, now an immortal, will still place lanterns by the river…”</p>
<p>Ranran was delighted to hear this. Their journey to Dragon Island had not been in vain, they had still found a lifeline.</p>
<p>Just as Ranran was about to bid farewell, the goddess kept staring at her. Her pale golden eyes turned a few times. After a long while, she said, “The scent of the black dragon on you is too strong, concealing your true essence. I just realized now that I seem to have seen you before your reincarnation…”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran widened her eyes. What? Did she come to Dragon Island before? She suddenly remembered that the mother of that little dragon had helped her during the Fan Yao Battle. Did she come to Dragon Island and steal *the little dragon’s mother?<br/>*苍龙 <em>its confusing because this is another name of the Azure/Green Dragon but the author used 青龙 for the Azure dragon, so there should be a distinction</em></p>
<p>But the goddess seemed to sense her confusion and said lightly, “The Cang Dragon was born to respond to a heavenly calamity, so its death had nothing to do with you. However, you did come to Dragon Island before and deposited something here. Since you’ve reincarnated and came back here, I’ll return it to you.”</p>
<p>After saying that, she pointed to the highest peak of Dragon Island and said, “There is a stone wall there. What you left behind is there.”</p>
<p>With that, she seemed unwilling to speak any more to outsiders. She leaped into the air, transformed back into a golden dragon, and went into the sea. However, her voice still echoed in the air, “I have given the dragons of the whole island orders to grant you an hour of convenience. If you find the person who slaughtered the Green dragon in the future and inform me, I will be very grateful…”</p>
<p>As the golden dragon’s words faded, Ranran said, “Let’s go, let’s go up the mountain quickly.”</p>
<p>She was indeed curious. Why did she leave something in such a remote and uninhabited place like Dragon Island in her past life?</p>
<p>The two of them rode the wind all the way, encountering no obstacles along the way. Although they often saw dragon heads of various sizes in the trees and ponds, their lantern-like big eyes staring at them, drooling.</p>
<p>This constantly reminded the master and disciple that with their bodies emitting the scent of the black dragon, they were quite tempting to the dragons. Once the hour was over and the goddess no longer protected them, those dragons might rush over eagerly, unable to resist the temptation of wild prey from outside the island.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When they finally reached the mountaintop, they could see the entire Dragon Island. Although there were many exotic flowers and plants, and the scenery of the island connected with the blue waters was enchanting, they were not in the mood to enjoy it. They hurriedly climbed to the top of Dragon Mountain.</p>
<p>At the top of the mountain stood a thick stone pillar, as if a divine staff had been fixed here.</p>
<p>In the ancient past, dragons freely roamed between heaven and earth as divine beings. Later, it was said that the dragon clan violated heavenly rules, so the supreme god used this Dragon-Sealing Staff to seal them here, forever unable to leave the island.</p>
<p>Occasionally, dragons would leave the island, but their final fate was always death without reincarnation. The little dragon Ranran saved was born outside the island, and the fact that it could return alive back here, was probably due to this reason.</p>
<p>They found a cliff on the mountaintop, bare and covered with vines and black-green moss.</p>
<p>On one side of the cliff, there was a peculiar giant rock, several times taller than a person. The rock had many weathered holes, resembling a broken beehive.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui waved away the vines on the cliff and guided water to wash it, revealing its true appearance.</p>
<p>In her past life, Mu Qingge must have loved exploring mountains and rivers and leaving behind her calligraphy. There was a long poem here, depicting the excitement of watching hundreds of dragons swimming freely.</p>
<p>Ranran tilted her head and looked for a while, thinking that her calligraphy in her past life was quite good, unlike her current self who hadn’t put much effort into writing.</p>
<p>However, Su Yi Shui focused on the poem for a while and paused at the end of the verses.</p>
<p>He squinted at the poem and realized it was an acrostic poem. Taking the first and last characters of each line, it formed the phrase “<em>Wait until the sunset.</em>“</p>
<p>It was already evening, and the sun was about to set. He said, “It looks like we have to wait a little longer…”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>And so, the two of them sat on the side of the cliff, waiting for the sun to set in the west. They also had time to admire the rare beauty of Dragon Island.</p>
<p>The little dragon they saved refused to leave and kept bringing Ranran big fishes. So Ranran took the time to make a fire and roasted two fish for the little dragon to eat.</p>
<p>The goddess’s guidance had been crucial, and this little dragon was of big help, so it was only fair to roast fish for it.</p>
<p>Just as the two were enjoying the roasted fish with the dragon, the sun gradually lowered to the sea level.</p>
<p>Ranran looked up, and suddenly the setting sun shone through the largest hole in the weathered big rock, casting light on the ground next to the cliff.</p>
<p>The two looked at each other and immediately understood. They ran over, picking up branches to dig the soil. Before long, they unearthed something.</p>
<p>Buried there was a sandalwood box locked with a strange mechanism that couldn’t be opened by force, with runes attached to the box preventing it from being forcibly opened.</p>
<p>Ranran felt that her past self was really too mischievous, coming up with so many obstacles even on Dragon Island, which was full of hostile dragons. What could be inside this box?</p>
<p>However, the time limit given by the Golden Dragon goddess had expired. Accompanied by the roars of countless dragons, seemingly drooling and rushing over towards them.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui reached out and grabbed Ranran, whispering, “Take the box, we need to leave Dragon Island immediately!”</p>
<p>After saying that, they each rode the wind and rushed towards the border of Dragon Island.</p>
<p>When they reached the boundary amidst lightning and thunder, the voice of the Golden Dragon goddess came again, faintly saying, “After you leave, if anyone asks about me, say that you have never seen me…”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After saying this, a golden dragon tail came out from the sea, creating a wave that pushed them out of the barrier.</p>
<p>Caught in the waves and pushed out, they heard Yu Tong urgently shouting not far away, “Master, Ranran, are you both okay?”</p>
<p>Ranran waved from the water and then jumped onto the large boat with Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>They had spent almost a day on Dragon Island, but Yu Tong and the others said they only felt that they had been inside for less than four hours.</p>
<p>It seemed that Dragon Island was indeed an isolated immortal realm, and time there did not synchronize with the human realm.</p>
<p>Thinking of the guidance from the Golden Dragon goddess, they didn’t want to waste any time and only wanted to find the person who lit thousands of lotus lanterns on the banks of the Lijiang River on the Qixi Festival.</p>
<p>The Lijiang River was not far from the entrance of Dragon Island’s sea area. The river stretched for thousands of miles, flowing into the sea at its mouth.</p>
<p>When the large boat reached the banks of the Lijiang River, they could already see people placing the lotus lanterns in the night.</p>
<p>Before long, many young men and women arrived at the riverside one after another. It felt like finding someone here was akin to finding a needle in a haystack.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">千盏莲灯 A THOUSAND LOTUS LANTERNS</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Ranran watched the young men and women releasing lanterns on the riverbank, exchanging glances and feelings with each other, but they couldn’t find anyone resembling the Medicine Immortal.</p>
<p>Elder Jiu with his wine-soaked nose and messy beard, was too deeply ingrained in people’s minds. Even though he had boasted that his biological brother was a handsome man, it was hard to believe, and there seemed to be an element of exaggeration in his words.</p>
<p>So Ranran mainly focused on finding an old man amidst the crowd.</p>
<p>However, although there were some elderly people on both sides of the river, they were all servants or coachmen, and no one was lighting lanterns on the banks.</p>
<p>According to what the Golden Dragon goddess had said, she hadn’t left the island in a hundred years. Even if the Medicine Immortal had a habit of lighting lotus lanterns, he might have changed his habit over the long years.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Ranran felt a bit discouraged, not knowing where to start anew. Were Wang Suizhi and the others destined to be transformed into water demons?</p>
<p>On the other hand, Qiu Xier was caught up in the atmosphere on both banks and bought two lotus lanterns, squatting on the riverbank with elder senior brother to light them.</p>
<p>Since their adventure inside the array on Red Flame Mountain, their relationship had grown stronger day by day. They could be described as *inseparable. While lighting the lotus lanterns together, Qiu Xier even kissed senior brother on the cheek, causing him to laugh foolishly.<br/>*如胶似漆 <em>literally like glue or paint – sticking very close together</em></p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Su Yi Shui glanced at Ranran’s glum expression and asked, “Do you want to light a lantern? I can buy you a few.”</p>
<p>Ranran shook her head, lacking interest, and said, “No need. These are all for praying for love and relationships, it’s no use for me to light them…”</p>
<p>Actually, Su Yi Shui didn’t really think that putting glued paper lanterns in the river would achieve anything either, it was just a lame gimmick to amuse the young girl.</p>
<p>He just casually asked and Ranran gave him a casual reply. But after that, her response started to make him increasingly uncomfortable after he mulled over it.</p>
<p>They were so intimate now, and yet she seemed indifferent to matters of marriage? Was she using him as a practice tool, discarding him after use without any concern?</p>
<p>Mu Qingge’s negative traits seemed to have persisted even after her reincarnation!</p>
<p>With these thoughts in mind, he silently went to the vendor and splurged on a hundred lotus lanterns, along with some paper and ink from a small jar. He asked Ranran to write down her wishes on each one before releasing them into the river.</p>
<p>Ranran looked dumbfounded at the pile of lotus lanterns brought over by the vendor and uncertainly asked Su Yi Shui, “Will lighting these attract the Medicine Immortal?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui pointed to the small pieces of paper inside the lanterns and said, “Write down what you want to say to your sweetheart.”</p>
<p>Once again, Ranran was dumbfounded. There were a hundred of them; writing on all of them would fill several pages of love letters…</p>
<p>“Where would I find a sweetheart, and what should I write?” she couldn’t help but mutter quietly.</p>
<p>Was Su Yi Shui considered her sweetheart? He was someone with incomplete memories. He probably didn’t even know if his feelings for Mu Qingge stemmed from love or guilt towards her?</p>
<p>Ranran knew she liked Su Yi Shui, but she also felt that the level of understanding between them was far from the deep connection between third senior sister and senior brother.</p>
<p>Her words “Where would I find a sweetheart” made Su Yi Shui’s handsome face fall completely.</p>
<p>“You always kiss me even though you don’t like me, are you playing with me?” Remembering how she had behaved like this before, teasing and flirting with him in public and then chatting and laughing with his seniors, calling Su Yu “Xiao Yu” nonstop, she seemed really fickle!</p>
<p>Ranran felt that the previous kisses had been due to the influence of the Spirit Spring. As for the kisses after his memory loss, they were simply accidents that occurred during their teaching sessions. But if he arrogantly assumed that she could only love him, it was too presumptuous!</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t feel like arguing with him and simply gave him half of the lotus lanterns, saying, “Why should I write all of them? You can write to your sweetheart too!”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui stared at her and coldly replied, “Many people admire me. Which one do you want me to write to?”</p>
<p>Ranran glared at him and said, “Then… give these lanterns away to someone else!”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui immediately retorted without hesitation, “No way!”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>In the end, after an argument, they both sat on the steps of the riverside pier, each holding a brush and writing on the paper before putting it into the lotus lanterns.</p>
<p>But just as Ranran finished writing on one and released it into the river, Su Yi Shui unexpectedly scooped it back up with a wave of his big hand and opened the paper to read.</p>
<p><em>“I hope he can improve his temper in future and not always grab people by the neck at the first sign of disagreement…”</em></p>
<p>These words didn’t sound like they’re written for a lover; they sound more like well wishes for a murderer.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui threw the lotus lantern into the river, glaring coldly at her.</p>
<p>Ranran mimicked him and retrieved the lotus lantern that Su Yi Shui had just put into the water. On the paper were dynamic and graceful writing: “<em>Virtuous and reserved, with refined manners</em>…”</p>
<p>What did this mean? Was it hoping for his future immortal companion to have the demeanor of a noble lady?</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui spoke up, “Since no one gave you a lantern for Qixi, I wrote some well-wishes for you.”</p>
<p>Ranran was about to burst into indignant laughter. Was he implying that she wasn’t reserved enough, and lacked elegance and refinement in her usual behavior?</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui stated matter-of-factly, “You smile at people even when you’re not familiar with them. Don’t you know you have a pair of captivating eyes that unwittingly attract others? You also don’t consider the age of the other person. If they are naive and impressionable youths, being smiled at by you so casually might lead to romantic fantasies.”</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t expect her congeniality and ability to be liked by others, could be seen as frivolous behavior. She immediately retorted, “Well you don’t smile at people, but its not like you have not seduced other women! Wen Hongshan, and also Mu Ranwu, they’re all malicious! You should write: ‘<em>Those who like me, need to have hearts as treacherous as snakes and scorpions, with bodies as resilient as steel, otherwise, they won’t last long in chaotic battles!</em>‘”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui hadn’t expected this young girl, once stripped of her obedient and filial disciple facade, to be so sharp-tongued! Unfortunately, everything she said was true, making it hard to argue.</p>
<p>For a moment, the two of them locked eyes, brewing their frustrations. Then like children having a tantrum, they used their pens as swords, “blessing” each other with many sentences. The result of seeing each other’s “blessings” so much was that both of their faces turned quite dark, completely missing the atmosphere of the tearful reunion of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl on Qixi Festival.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Finally, Su Yishui couldn’t take it anymore. He snatched Ranran’s brush and snapped it in two “Am I really that insufferable in your eyes?”</p>
<p>Ranran retorted, “I’m not that bad. I only wrote about how you like to say one thing but mean another and your terrible temper…”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui, with cold eyes, handed her another lotus lantern, “Write something good this time….”</p>
<p>Ranran looked at his sulky handsome face and felt that in her past life, she really managed to depict this ferocious beast so vividly in her Playing Classics. With that thought, she picked up her brush and quickly drew long tiger whiskers on Su Yi Shui’s face.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui hadn’t expected her to be so mischievous; he was about to go over and pull Ranran’s hairbun.</p>
<p>Ranran chuckled as she fell into Su Yi Shui’s arms, reaching out to touch his ink-stained cheek, gradually turning serious as she murmured “A human is not god, how can they be perfect. Even if you are bad, in the eyes of someone who truly loves you, you are still one of a kind…”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui gazed deeply into her clear eyes and suddenly felt that all the words written on paper were not important anymore. At this moment, her eyes were full of him, and he knew that even twenty years ago, when he turned into the demon’s son possessed by the spiritual spring, there was one person who never gave up on him…</p>
<p>In her eyes, was he that unique person?</p>
<p>As these thoughts ran in his mind, Su Yi Shui had already lowered his head and kissed her cherry lips which lingered with the sweet fragrance of date cake.</p>
<p>As their lips and tongues intertwined, the heart fluttering entanglement of two lifetimes didn’t need words or eye contact, they could feel it through their heartbeats and exhilaration.</p>
<p>When they separated, Ranran looked at Su Yi Shui’s ink-stained handsome face and couldn’t help but laugh out loud.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui turned her little head to look at the lake surface, showing her her own ink-stained face. During their kiss just now, Ranran’s fair cheeks was also stained with ink.</p>
<p>“Oh no!” Ranran couldn’t help but let out a cry of distress, quickly splashing water on her face. Meanwhile, Su Yi Shui asked solemnly “How about it, do you feel much better now?”</p>
<p>She couldn’t help but look up at him. She finally understood why he was teasing her like this today. He must have noticed her being troubled and guilty about Wang Suizhi and the others, so he picked a fight with her to divert her attention.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui wet his handkerchief and wiped her face while saying “Everything is preordained. You’ve done your best. If it doesn’t work out, it’s also fate. If you could do everything perfectly, you’d be more powerful than immortals. Then what’s the point of cultivating and understanding the Dao?”</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t say anything, she just planted a wet kiss on his face and then quickly lowered her head to wash her face.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As she washed her face, upstream there were groups of lanterns flowing down with the water, their flickering lights reflecting on the lake, creating a dazzling scene. Ranran glimpsed at the lotus lanterns they had just released, suddenly dispersing in two different directions.</p>
<p>It seemed like an invisible force was pushing them apart. Squinting her eyes, Ranran carefully observed that among the group of lanterns, some were different from the rest, drifting faster towards the mouth of the river compared to the other lotus lanterns.</p>
<p>And her lotus lanterns seemed to have been pushed by those golden lanterns just now, so it floated towards both banks.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui, who was washing his face, also noticed these lotus lanterns which seemed to carry spiritual energy.</p>
<p>After exchanging a glance, the two quickly stood up and headed towards the direction where the lotus lanterns were drifting from.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As they moved further ahead, they saw a piece of exposed land in the center of the river, where a man in a gray robe with cascading long hair sitting on this oasis, folding lotus lanterns with his own hands and then placing them into the river.</p>
<p>When those paper lanterns entered the water, they seemed to be imbued with energy, immediately spinning and rushing towards the mouth of the river.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui and Ranran jumped onto the small island just as the man finished placing the thousandth lotus lantern and was about to leave.</p>
<p>Ranran quickly called out “Are you the Medicine Immortal?”</p>
<p>Hearing this, the man turned his head and glanced at Xue Ranran, then squinted his eyes, probably also noticing Ranran’s unusual destiny.</p>
<p>And Ranran quietly looked at the Medicine Immortal’s face, thinking to herself: If he really is the Medicine Immortal, then could Elder Jiu be a child his parents brought home to fill the quota?</p>
<p>This man was really too beautiful… Ranran racked her brain but could only think of the word “<em>beautiful</em>“.</p>
<p>But he was different from Wei Jiu’s feminine beauty. He exuded a clean and pure beauty, like the Western Mountain Ice Lotus, making people feel calm and not daring to tarnish it even a bit.</p>
<p>Looking at this face, then recalling Elder Jiu with his messy hair and beard, it really takes some imagination to associate these two as brothers.</p>
<p>However, that person actually nodded slightly and then looked over the two of them, saying, “One of you two, seem to be an old acquaintance of mine.”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran had been deceived by the Fake Old Immortal of Tianmai Mountain, so she naturally wouldn’t trust him easily. She smiled and said, “I am acquainted with your younger brother, he misses you very much…”</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal smiled slightly, gazing at the vast river waves, and said softly, “This doesn’t sound like something he would say. If he really missed me, he would have ascended to immortality long ago. I’m afraid there are too many fine wines in the world, making him *forget his original plans… Mu Qingge, are you trying to probe me with these words, are you afraid that I’m fake?”<br/><br/>*乐不思蜀 <em>is an idiom that originated from the Three Kingdoms period, referring to someone who is so contented or immersed in pleasure that they forget about returning home or their responsibilities.</em></p>
<p>Ranran didn’t expect him to see through her past life with one glance. It seemed that this person in front of her did have some connection with Elder Jiu. At least he seem to understand exactly what kind of person Elder Jiu is.</p>
<p>According to Elder Jiu, she had also been good friends with this Medicine Immortal twenty years ago. Judging from his appearance alone, he indeed met her aesthetic requirements for handsome men at that time.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When Ranran explained the purpose of their visit, the Medicine Immortal suddenly sighed, “You actually know I possess some Green Dragon’s blood? And both of you have the aura of dragons, probably from visiting the Dragon Island… Fengmou refused to give you the Green Dragon’s blood, so she told you to come find me?”</p>
<p><em>Fengmou?</em> Ranran shook her head, “I don’t know anyone named Fengmou.”</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal said mildly, “That’s the name I gave her. She said she didn’t have a name and let me call her whatever I liked. Her eyes contained a golden light like the sun, resembling a golden phoenix, so I named her Fengmou…”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Ranran immediately realized who he was referring to as Fengmou.</p>
<p>On Dragon Island, only the goddess’s eyes had a faint golden color. She remembered the scar on the goddess’s face, seemingly related to when she had left Dragon Island. Could it be that hundreds of years ago, when she left Dragon Island, she met the Medicine Immortal?</p>
<p><em>But why did the goddess forbid mentioning her to outsiders?</em></p>
<p>Sure enough, the Medicine Immortal then asked, “Is she…well now?”</p>
<p>Ranran clasped her hands and said, “We were entrusted to not discuss matters regarding the goddess, please forgive us.” As for the Green Dragon’s blood, Ranran briefly gave an account of the incident about how the Green Dragon had been drained.</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal was quite shocked. After a moment, he looked at the lotus lanterns drifting towards the mouth of the sea in the distance and said with a wry smile, “Even if you didn’t say anything, I could guess. I come here every year to release lanterns, and these lotus lanterns drift towards Dragon Island… I thought she didn’t receive them. But since you’ve come to find me, it must also because she guided you. But if she received them, why doesn’t she respond to me and release a lantern out? Does she still refuse to forgive me?”</p>
<p>At this moment, Su Yishui spoke up, “Many years ago, a golden dragon appeared in Mount Bi, transformed into a young girl and fell in love with a cultivator. However, the love between humans and dragons is against the natural order, so in the end, they were forced to separate. And that dragon, lost five hundred years of cultivation in order to protect the cultivator from Heavenly Tribulation…”</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal looked affected. He stood silently on the oasis for a while before saying, “Yes, that person who fell in love with the dragon girl was me. Back then, in order to collect the Green Dragon’s blood, I devised a plan for several water rats to go to the island. As a result, she came out of Dragon Island to capture me. After that, we met and fell in love. After she blocked the Heavenly Tribulation for me, she said she was tired of love and wanted to return to Dragon Island… never to meet with me ever again.”</p>
<p>When he heard this, Su Yishui raised his eyebrows slightly. The Medicine Immortal glanced at him and with a snap of his fingers, a jade bottle appeared in his hand, which he handed to Ranran, saying, “Give this to the *Old Wine Immortal, he knows what to do.”</p>
<p>After saying this, he turned to Su Yi Shui and said, “You must be Su Yi Shui, right? You seemed to have something to say just now, why don’t you say it directly.”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui did not intend to say much, but considering that the Medicine Immortal did not make things difficult for Xue Ranran, he said, “You know where Dragon Island is, if you truly wanted to see her, I believe you have a way to get there. Why bother folding lotus lanterns here every year, relying on the river and the tides?”</p>
<p>Since losing his memory, he lacked the maturity and tolerance that had accumulated over twenty years. His words were sharp and incisive, and tend to be spot-on.</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal smiled wryly, “Do you think I haven’t tried to find her? But she doesn’t want to see me. What can I do even if I go?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui said coldly, “A woman who was willing to sacrifice five hundred years of cultivation and ruin her appearance for you, said she doesn’t love you anymore, and you believed her? Was it because she said it decisively, or did you choose to go along with it? If you were in love with someone from the Dragon Clan, you cannot ascend no matter how high your cultivation is. Perhaps it wasn’t her who cut off the love, but she saw that your dedication to cultivation surpassed your love for her. To avoid you having to make a choice, she made the decision for you.”</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal was moved by these words, his heart actually lurched for a moment. After becoming immortal, he hadn’t experienced such emotional fluctuations for a long time.</p>
<p>He asked softly, “Did she tell you all this?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui shook his head, saying indifferently ” I merely guessed. As a man, if you can’t protect the woman you love, whether you become immortal or not, is pointless. If you love someone, whether they’re human or ghost, in heaven or on earth, you should stay by her side! “</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Su Yi Shui hadn’t finished speaking, when a cold female voice interrupted, “Such mundane views, it’s better left unsaid. Your cultivation is shallow, how do you know how difficult it is to become immortal? Medicine Immortal, if matters here are done; we should return to the immortal cave…”</p>
<p>Ranran followed the voice and saw a woman with a purple aura above her head approach the Medicine Immortal. She reached out naturally and took his arm, and seemed to be the Medicine Immortal’s immortal companion.</p>
<p>The years to become immortals were long, and often like-minded immortals would become partners, living in the same cave, cultivating together. Although they were not as loving as mortal couples, they were still companions in chess, alchemy and cultivation.</p>
<p>Ranran felt that Su Yi Shui’s words were too direct, fearing that he might offend the Medicine Immortal if he said any more, so she pulled his sleeve and bid the Medicine Immortal and the female immortal goodbye, and left with him.</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal’s hearing was exceptional. Even though they had walked quite a distance, he could still clearly hear Ranran lecturing him in a low voice, “What’s the use of saying so much? His relationship with the goddess is already in the past. Now that he has a new immortal partner, do you want to incite him to be unfaithful?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui coldly snorted, “I just hope he won’t pretend anymore. Since the love is over and he already has an immortal companion, what’s the meaning behind releasing those lotus lanterns to Dragon Island every year? I just hope that next year, he’ll give peace to the one on the island…”</p>
<p>Hearing this, the Medicine Immortal felt a few painful twinges in his heart again. The Jade Lotus Immortal, who lived with him in the immortal cave, transferred some vitality to protect his heart meridians, saying, “You’ve forgotten that during the Heavenly Tribulation back then, you were cursed not to develop feelings. You’d better come back with me for cultivation. Don’t take the words of a rash youngster to heart.”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The Medicine Immortal watched Su Yi Shui’s departing figure and pondered, “Back then, I found it strange when I heard that Mu Qingge’s soul was shattered and yet managed to be reincarnated by shifting her soul to a tree. Even as an immortal, it’s impossible to perform such a feat against the heavens. How did that Su Yi Shui do it, to negate death with only half a golden core? Apart from having his destiny altered, doesn’t his life chart seem a bit peculiar?”</p>
<p>But the Jade Lotus Immortal didn’t care about the resurrection of a mere mortal woman, she was more concerned about the Green Dragon’s blood being drained.</p>
<p>The blood of the Green Dragon was extremely spiritual, just a few drops could achieve a great deal. And now, an entire Green Dragon’s blood had been drained. What did the person who offended the divine intend to do? This was what they needed to urgently get to the bottom of, as immortals.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.” the Jade Lotus Immortal urged again.</p>
<p>Back then she had accompanied the Medicine Immortal in cultivation, but later a golden dragon appeared, causing the Medicine Immortal to leave her. Fortunately, after some twists and turns, everything returned to the right path. Now she lived together with the Medicine Immortal in the same cave, becoming immortal partners.</p>
<p>She won’t allow the Medicine Immortal to act recklessly because of old feelings. That dragon tribulation… had long ended!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The two who obtained the Green Dragon’s blood didn’t even have time to inform Qiu Xier and the others. They hurried back without stopping to the Qiongqi Village.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the cave where the cursed people temporarily resided, they found the entire mountain surrounded by a large number of soldiers.</p>
<p>As the two of them leaped to the cave entrance, they discovered that the entire entrance had been blocked off with earth and rocks.</p>
<p>This was a method devised by Elder Jiu. By mixing lime with the soil and blocking the cave entrance, it temporarily isolated moisture to prevent those transformed from smelling the mountain spring’s aura and becoming frenzied.</p>
<p>However, only Elder Jiu and Yuchen were guarding the cave entrance, and Zhou Feihua was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>According to Elder Jiu and Yuchen, among the soldiers below, there were also a few people from the Yi Ren Hall. Initially, they wanted to use True fire to burn down the mountain. Zhou Feihua appeared to stop them and fought with them, revealing her whereabouts, which was then reported to the court.</p>
<p>Later, an edict came, specifying that Zhou Feihua should go to meet the emperor. As long as she agreed, they could temporarily refrain from setting fire to the mountain.</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua, in order to protect the cursed people who were unable to be moved, went down the mountain, to meet the emperor.</p>
<p>Time was of the essence. Ranran didn’t have time to explain the various dangers they encountered on the way or about meeting his brother. She just handed the Green Dragon’s blood to Elder Jiu and urged him to quickly detoxify these cursed people.</p>
<p>The people surrounding them at the foot of the mountain seemed loud and boisterous, but it was only due to their inner fear. Only by restoring these people to their original state as soon as possible could they dispel the apprehension of the soldiers.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">玩物丧志   LOSING FOCUS DUE TO FRIVOLOUS PURSUITS</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Elder Jiu first ran to the mountain ditch and caught more than a dozen leeches, dripping a few drops of Green Dragon’s blood on each of them. The bodies of these leeches immediately emitted a faint green light. Then, he placed the leeches on the bodies of those who were cursed.</p>
<p>These soft worms automatically found places to bite in the gaps between their scales, then remained still, beginning to suck their blood.</p>
<p>Elder Jiu said they weren’t sucking blood but rather the demonic energy within these people. As the bodies of the leeches grew larger, the scales on these people’s bodies slowly disappeared, and their strange appearances began to recover.</p>
<p>And the once smooth and moist bodies of the leeches gradually grew scales, resembling shrunken Jiao dragons.</p>
<p>When the demonic energy was drained completely, Elder Jiu caught these leeches and put them into a wine gourd covered with runes. According to him, after refining for forty-nine days within the wine gourd, these leeches would turn into blood and lose their demonic nature.</p>
<p>As for those who finally broke the curse, they all began to sleep soundly. After all, experiencing such a huge transformation also depleted their vitality, requiring a good rest.</p>
<p>While they were asleep, Xue Ranran could finally relax.</p>
<p>However, as she stood at the mountaintop looking down, apart from the soldiers surrounding the mountain, there were also numerous lotus lanterns of different sizes floating in the rivers and streams below.</p>
<p>Ranran couldn’t help but think of the goddess. Just as Su Yi Shui said, after she sacrificed five hundred years of cultivation, perhaps it wasn’t that she didn’t love any more, but that she saw through the Medicine Immortal’s obsession with cultivation and chose to withdraw?</p>
<p>After all, as Elder Jiu said, his brother had always been dedicated to cultivation, definitely more so than him.</p>
<p>Ranran suddenly admired the goddess even more. To love and hate so decisively, to make a clean break, was actually stronger than many immortals and mortals.</p>
<p>Could it be that she refused to respond to the Medicine Immortal’s lotus lanterns because she had already guessed that in the long years to come, there would surely be someone else by his side?</p>
<p>If so, it would be better to forget each other in this world.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Just as she sighed, Su Yi Shui arrived behind her. “Your dear disciple has finally recovered from the curse, why are you still feeling down?”</p>
<p>Ranran shook her head. “It’s not that I’m unhappy, just feeling a little sentimental…”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui followed her gaze and saw the lotus lanterns in the river below, instantly understanding what she was thinking.</p>
<p>“The Medicine Immortal and you are also old acquaintances. Back then, he thought you were also as unambitious in cultivation as his brother.” </p>
<p>Ranran smiled indifferently, “Being human or immortal is just a difference in longevity, why be so obsessed? The powerful Duntian achieved enlightenment, but in the end, didn’t he also lose interest in life and chose to enter Nirvana?”</p>
<p>Her indifferent demeanor really resembled Mu Qingge from twenty years ago. In the past, Xishan had always been a place for leisure. Rather than leading her disciples to cultivate immortality, it was more like leading a group of children to frolic in the mortal realm.</p>
<p>Although they all honed their respective skills, most of them had little to do with becoming immortal. They simply indulged in their own various interests. Otherwise, with Mu Qingge’s cultivation and skills, how could the three major sects flaunt their power?</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui used to detest Mu Qingge intensely, feeling that her carefree attitude hindered his progress. His earnest cultivation in Xishan was out of phase with his fellow disciples.</p>
<p>However, seeing the Medicine Immortal that day truly disgusted Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>At that moment, he even felt that the goddess on Dragon Island was somewhat similar to his mother, who had been abandoned by the man who claimed to love her. That’s why he couldn’t help himself, but mock the Medicine Immortal.</p>
<p>In his opinion, a man could choose not to love, but he shouldn’t love with such calculation. To enjoy romance when there’s no trouble, but cast aside the lover whom he made promises to when things got tough, then occasionally reminiscing about that deep love later on—such people made him sick even with just a glance.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, such people were common in the world. Even Emperor Su Yu seemed to have regained appreciation for Zhou Feihua and was trying various ways to bring her back to the palace.</p>
<p>Early the next day, just as the sky was brightening, the soldiers below suddenly retreated one after another. It was said to be an order from higher ups, instructing them to no longer surround the mountain.</p>
<p>At this time, the people in the cave had also mostly recovered. They supported each other with sturdy branches as crutches and descended from the mountain.</p>
<p>When those people returned to the village, someone had already rushed to inform the villagers early on. Relatives came out tearfully to welcome them, but those who had once led the soldiers to besiege them all kept their doors tightly shut.</p>
<p>It seemed that the relationships in between neighbors in this village would need time to mend.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Wang Suizhi did not leave. After he made arrangements for his subordinates and settled the children, he explicitly expressed his desire to serve by Xue Ranran’s side, fulfilling his filial duty.</p>
<p>However, when Su Yi Shui clearly stated that food resources in the Western Mountains were precious and not to be wasted on idlers, Xue Ranran had to tactfully explain that she was no longer the sect leader of Xishan, and she also had to make a living under someone else’s roof, so she couldn’t bring her disciples along.</p>
<p>But Wang Suizhi said, “Master, how can you endure grievances under Su Yishui’s roof? The houses on Western Mountain must be old and unusable by now. Your disciple will find another mountain for you to cultivate and establish a new sect! That Western Mountain, you don’t have to return there!”</p>
<p>As that imposter Mu Ranwu had planned the same thing before, Wang Suiji had already made arrangements for everything. Not only did he select a beautiful mountain, but he also bought the entire mountain and started construction already.</p>
<p>With a wealthy and ambitious disciple, Wang Suizhi said that if his master was dissatisfied and unwilling to yield to Mu Ranwu’s tastes, he could also buy another mountain for her to cultivate.</p>
<p>This statement left Qiu Xier and Gao Cang gasping in awe, with envy written all over their faces.</p>
<p>However, Su Yi Shui’s expression darkened slightly, and his sharp gaze pierced through Wang god of wealth like a knife.</p>
<p>He even channeled a private message to Xue Ranran, suggesting that if she wanted to establish a new sect on another mountain, Wang Suizhi should first prepare a tomb for himself!</p>
<p>Seeing the seriousness in Su Yi Shui’s eyes, Xue Ranran, for the sake of her beloved disciple Wang Suizhi’s life, had to mediate and say that the Feng Shui on Western Mountains was excellent for her, and she was already accustomed to living there.</p>
<p>Wang Suizhi nodded understandingly, then took out a palm-sized gold abacus and made a few clicks. He began to assess the value of Su Yi Shui’s Western Mountain, stating that he was willing to buy it at ten times the market price, so that Su Yi Shui could relocate.</p>
<p>It was all Xue Ranran could do to firmly hold onto Su Yi Shui’s waist with all her strength, to avoid conflict between former disciples and eventual bloodshed.</p>
<p>In the end, Wang Suizhi used his merchant’s eloquence to its fullest. The result of the argument was that Wang Suizhi finally could return to Western Mountain as he wished and could serve his mentor by her side.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Through Wang Suizhi, Xue Ranran also learned more secrets about the Fantian Sect.</p>
<p>According to Wang Suizhi, the demonic ritual that used children as cauldrons to replenish Mu Ranwu’s vitality seemed to be a method taught by the Fantian Sect.</p>
<p>Moreover, the influence of the Fantian Sect seemed to be growing. Back then, Mu Ranwu under the guise of Mu Qingge, had once proudly told him that the rise of the Fantian Sect owed much to her efforts. In the future, all major sects would be under the rule of the Fantian Sect.</p>
<p>As an Elder who contributed to this revival, she and her disciples would reap endless benefits. Once they resurrected the Sect Master, they wouldn’t have to struggle to cultivate anymore. They could ascend directly without enduring the tribulations, and become immortals soon.</p>
<p>At that time, Wang Suizhi had felt uneasy about these grand promises. However, seeing how close that imposter and the Fantian Sect were, as a disciple, he couldn’t say anything.</p>
<p>But now, looking back, wasn’t this just a demonic path of evil? Those who bypassed the tribulations were not immortals but only demons. They had no place in the Upper, Middle and Lower Immortal classes, and could only be considered powerful demon kings.</p>
<p>After hearing this, Su Yi Shui asked, “Who did she say the Sect Master is?”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran had read “Records of the Fantian Sect” and had seen related descriptions in those two volumes. The one referred to as the Sect Master could only be the first-generation Demon Lord, the demon king whose skull was refined into gold!</p>
<p>Could it be that the Fantian Sect wanted to resurrect that golden skull?</p>
<p>At that moment, Ranran thought of the drained Green dragon again. Could the person behind all this be planning to use the dragon’s blood to resurrect the gold-skulled demon?</p>
<p>She also remembered the Rebirth tree that she was reincarnated from and asked Su Yi Shui if he remembered how he knew of  the method of resurrection.</p>
<p>But Su Yi Shui could not remember about that part any more.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As for Zhou Feihua, after disappearing for three days and nights, she returned to Qiongqi Village.</p>
<p>Ranran asked her if the Emperor wanted to rekindle their old relationship.</p>
<p>But Zhou Feihua smiled coldly, “How could someone who sits on the throne be as sentimental as you and me? It turns out that my father’s old subordinates were difficult to control, so the Emperor had to reinstate my father and wanted to mend the relationship between ruler and subject. Thus, he thought of inviting me back to the palace… In his eyes, I am ultimately just a pawn with some remaining value.”</p>
<p>Ranran asked, “So, did you agree to return?”</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua shook her head, “My father sent me a letter secretly. The Emperor is currently treating my father favorably as he is unable to manage those generals well. However, once the crisis is over, my father will probably be the first one to go. But to appease the Emperor, I have to go to the palace and deal with him for a few days. After that, I will bid you farewell and hope you take care.”</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t understand the intrigues of the Great Qi Dynasty, but Zhou Feihua seemed to have already discussed countermeasures with General Zhou Dao. She didn’t want to say much more, so after bidding farewell by the river, they went their separate ways.</p>
<p>Before leaving, Zhou Feihua specially reminded Ranran, “The emergence of various monsters everywhere has increased the Emperor’s attention to the cultivation world. The Emperor is now very close to the Crimson Gate Sect. Like the Yiren Hall, the Crimson Gate sect will probably become another tool for the Emperor’s ambitions. Your Xishan is currently ahead of the three major sects in everything, so you must be extra careful in the future!”</p>
<p>Ranran nodded and also advised Zhou Feihua, “You should be careful too. Su Yu’s intentions are unpredictable. Being with such a person is like being with tigers and wolves. Your priority should be self-preservation. Once you settled General Zhou, you should leave quickly.”</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua nodded and said, “Consort Jing has already passed. This time, I am entering the palace in the capacity of a guard. Su Yu has been having nightmares recently, said to be haunted by nightmares. So, he is using my father as leverage to make me return to the palace to continue doing swordplay for him and dispel his nightmares. Once his nightmares subsides, he probably won’t cling onto me anymore.”</p>
<p>Ranran felt that Zhou Feihua was being a little too optimistic, so she handed Zhou Feihua a few spiritual charms, “These talimans can command birds to deliver messages. If you encounter any unforeseen events in the capital, be sure to send me a message as soon as you can.”</p>
<p>Zhou Feihua smiled and nodded. She couldn’t help giving Ranran a hug, patting her back gently, “You take care too and love yourself more. In your past life, you carried too much burden, all by yourself, even immortals couldn’t bear it. Now, Su Yi Shui is the sect leader of Xishan. If anything happens, let the tall man bear the brunt. If you sense any danger, be clever and know when to run. Do you know how heartbroken I was twenty years ago, when I heard you had died…”</p>
<p>Ranran couldn’t remember how her friendship with Zhou Feihua was twenty years ago, but despite the age gap between them now, they could still connect as if nothing had changed.</p>
<p>Friendship is truly mysterious. Even across two lifetimes, it can still continue seamlessly.</p>
<p>The two talked by the river for most of the night before reluctantly parting ways.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When they left the Qiongqi Village, it seemed that the number of monsters in various places had decreased. It seemed like someone had released the monsters to cause chaos, but then removed more than half overnight, restoring peace.</p>
<p>However, Elder Jiu said that too many monsters had appeared before, and the balance between Yin and Yang in the world had already been disrupted.</p>
<p>Ordinary people might think that the world was slowly returning to peace, but those with profound cultivation could sense that the balance between Yin and Yang seemed to be changing slightly. Perhaps something big would happen soon.</p>
<p>But for Wang Suizhi, who had just returned to Xishan, it already felt like the end of the world, and his resentment was hard to quell!</p>
<p>What kind of Sect leader of Xishan was Su Yi Shui? The palaces of Western Mountain were once magnificent and luxurious. How did they become so dilapidated now?</p>
<p>According to Yutong, this was actually the restored appearance after she recently had craftsmen repair it! Moreover, his former mentor, the present Xue Ranran, didn’t even live in the best house on Western Mountain; she just lived in the disciples’ courtyard.</p>
<p>Although there were flowers and plants in the yard, and the furnishings inside were the style favored by young girls, Wang Suizhi felt that it was all too plain and petty, not suitable for living.</p>
<p>With the arrival of the God of Wealth to Xishan, even ordinary fish on the dinner table had disappeared, replaced by deep-sea fish from the East sea, bird’s nest soup, and even prawns, each the size of a child’s arm.</p>
<p>This made the several bumpkin disciples of Xishan confused every time they sat down to eat and had to ask about every dish, otherwise they would not know what ingredients they were consuming.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>And in the following days, many of Mu Qingge’s former disciples came one after another. They had acknowledged the wrong master in the past, but after hearing the truth, they came, crying and kneeling at the foot of Western Mountain, begging for forgiveness.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran had nothing that she couldn’t forgive them for, but it was difficult to fulfill their wishes and bring them back to Xishan.</p>
<p>After all, Su Yishui was now the Sect leader of Xishan. He had recently favored peace and quiet, and had driven away the batch of disciples he had recently accepted. Obviously he wasn’t going to allow Xue Ranran to bring back her disciples from her past life.</p>
<p>When Ranran asked him why he had asked the junior disciples to leave the mountain, of course, he wasn’t going to tell the truth. Seeing those young disciples surrounding their blooming senior sister Ranran, that atmosphere of youthful vitality, made him feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>So, he just said solemnly, “In cultivation, besides cultivating Qi, one must also broaden their horizons and gain worldly experience. If one stays on the mountain for too long, they will only cultivate narrow-mindedness. Letting them leave the mountain for adventures will help them cultivate better.”</p>
<p>Such a dignified explanation, truly earned respect. Ranran recalled that he had also brought the new disciples to get experience at Wangxiang Pass in the past, which did indeed broaden their horizons, and their cultivation progressed rapidly thereafter.</p>
<p>So, when she saw off those tearful junior disciples leaving the mountain, as their senior sister, she was filled with encouragement, promising them a bright future.</p>
<p>The gentle words of consolation from their beautiful and kind senior sister, made these young men who had been coldly driven away by their master, feel the warmth of their sect once again. With lifted spirits, they carried their bags and left the mountain for experiences, vowing to return to Western Mountain as new individuals.</p>
<p>As for Su Yi Shui’s reasons for preventing the old disciples of Western Mountain from returning, they were even more lofty and grand.</p>
<p>“They have been away from Xishan for twenty years, each already having their own lives. Moreover, some of them have associated with Mu Ranwu. The human heart is inscrutable and must be guarded against. It’s fine if you want to acknowledge them, but it’s not suitable to bring them all back here… And as for that Wang Suizhi, although he is as wealthy as a nation, there’s no need for such a display on Western Mountain. Our Xishan’s financial strength is not inferior to his, we don’t lack his gold and silver.”</p>
<p>After saying so much, perhaps only the last sentence was actually heartfelt. However, Xue Ranran remembered that Yutong had once said that Su Yi Shui disliked extravagance, so his aversion to Wang Suizhi might indeed be due to an incompatibility of lifestyles.</p>
<p>So, Ranran secretly advised Wang Suizhi to be frugal and not to bring expensive ingredients, furniture and ornaments to the mountain, especially to her courtyard.</p>
<p>Wang Suizhi listened with tears in his eyes, “Master has been reborn for so long, yet you have to live under someone else’s roof this way? It’s regrettable that I didn’t know anything and couldn’t take care of Master properly. That Su Yi Shui is a selfish and heartless person! Clearly knowing that you are his master, he still acts like the sect master himself… Master, you should leave with me and establish a new sect in another mountain!”</p>
<p>The tears of this middle-aged man were actually more difficult to handle than the tears of a pitiful young girl. Moreover, when Wang Suizhi cried, it was truly heartfelt and difficult to hold back.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran didn’t know how to comfort her beloved disciple, so she looked desperately at Su Yi Shui who was not far away, half-hidden in the window of a small building among the flowers.</p>
<p>He had been eavesdropping for a long time, it was time for him to show up and help her out of this predicament.</p>
<p>However, that man with a cold face just snorted and walked away without even looking back.</p>
<p>Ranran couldn’t help but feel a little angry and even thought that the idea of establishing a new sect and living alone was not all bad. At least, she wouldn’t have to see someone’s cold face anymore.</p>
<p>However, after a short while, Yutong hurried over and unceremoniously pushed away the still-sorrowful Wang Suizhi with her shoulder. She said to Ranran, “Master has already brought your parents and Mr Zeng back to Xishan. Tonight, Master wants to welcome them with a good meal, so help me plan a menu with dishes that your parents like.”</p>
<p>Being rushed this way by Yutong, did help get Ranran out of this awkward situation.</p>
<p>Moreover, she didn’t expect that Su Yi Shui, who had always complained about too many people on the mountain recently, would actually bring her parents over here. This was quite a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>Wang Suizhi also stopped feeling sorrowful and went to catch up with his fourteenth junior brother, Zeng Yi. He had been puzzled before about why old fourteenth had supported Su Yi Shui in his tyranny.</p>
<p>Now that he thought about it, he realized that Zeng Yi had known everything early on and silently protected the true master.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>However, it wasn’t until the evening that the Xue couple and Zeng Yi arrived at Western Mountain. Yutong must have rushed to tell her the news, because Su Yi Shui had asked her to help resolve Ranran’s situation.</p>
<p>So, after having a reunion dinner with her parents, Ranran specially washed some fruits and went to find Su Yi Shui by the Ice Lotus Pond.</p>
<p>In the past he used to like to play the zither by the pond at night, watching the faintly glowing ice lotus. But now, the amnesic Su Yi Shui didn’t quite like playing the zither and preferred to sit by the pond and light a lamp to read.</p>
<p>The moon tonight was beautiful. Ranran fed a piece of cut sweet melon to Su Yi Shui before looking at the dusty zither placed in the pavilion. On impulse she sat down at the zither, wiping off the dust with a handkerchief and oiling the strings. Then, she tried to tune the zither and play a simple tune.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui had taught her how to play in the past, so she could barely be considered a novice. Therefore, although the playing was somewhat raw, it was still passable.</p>
<p>Su Yishui put down the book in his hand and slowly looked up at Ranran.</p>
<p>In her past life, Mu Qingge was an expert at playing the zither, and her zither music was comparable to celestial music. This had made him detest the zither and not like it much.</p>
<p>The zither in the pavilion had been a beloved possession left by Mu Qingge. Yutong told him that in these past twenty years, Su Yi Shui’s greatest hobby was playing this zither. His proficiency was supposedly quite high, which was somewhat inconceivable.</p>
<p>When Su Yi Shui saw Ranran playing the zither, he found that he no longer had an aversion to the deep and melodious sound of the zither.</p>
<p>Ranran tried to play half a tune but couldn’t get one note right no matter what. So, she looked up at Su Yi Shui and asked, “Shifu, how should this part be played?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui inititally wanted to say that he didn’t like playing the zither, but he still inexplicably got up and sat behind Ranran, wrapping his long arms around her and placing his fingers on the zither strings.</p>
<p>It seemed that sometimes *muscle memory was more useful than brain memory. Su Yi Shui didn’t even think much; his fingers automatically stroked the zither strings, playing a melodious tune.</p>
<p>The tune he played was “Living in seclusion in Mountains and rivers” the favorite of Mu Qingge in the past.<br/>*渔樵  1 打鱼砍柴 2 渔人和樵夫 3 指隐居    <br/>山水 Mountains and rivers</p>
<p>This tune was quite difficult, but he played it effortlessly. He couldn’t help but wonder how much effort he had put into playing the zither in these past twenty years?</p>
<p>No wonder he hadn’t made any progress in cultivation in these twenty years. It turned out that, like the past life of this little demoness, he had been pursuing frivolous endeavors…</p>
<p>But when he saw Ranran turning joyously to look at him, immersed in the elegant music, Su Yi Shui suddenly thought that occasionally indulging in such distractions and frivolous pastimes wasn’t bad either…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>
<p>*Its funny that Su Yi Shui couldn’t remember how to play chess but he remembered how to play the zither… I suppose playing a tune could be muscle memory and chess required to actually remember the stratagems? haha</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">佳偶生怨   A good match turning into resentment</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>As the melodious zither melody filled the mountains, Wang Suizhi and Zeng Yi, the two fellow disciple brothers, were also drinking and reminiscing on a side pavilion.</p>
<p>Looking beyond the overlapping trees and the water pond, the two could see the scene of the two people playing the zither and gazing at each other by the lotus pond.</p>
<p>Wang Suizhi’s glass of wine was shaking in his hand, spilling all over, and he exclaimed with shock and anger, “Shameless scoundrel! How… how dare he treat Master this way!”</p>
<p>Zeng Yi used his palm to hold the wine pot and poured another cup for his senior brother. He said calmly, “Senior Brother, have a drink.”</p>
<p>Wang Suizhi slammed his wine glass down heavily on the table, “Such disgraceful behavior, aren’t you angry?”</p>
<p>Zeng Yi shook his head and said calmly, “If I didn’t know about their past, maybe I would be as angry as you. But did you think Master risked everything and went against the entire world for Su Yishui to change his destiny,  just because of a master-disciple relationship?”</p>
<p>Wang Suizhi was stunned by the question, and Zeng Yi continued, “We claim to be good disciples of Master. Back when Master’s soul was scattered, only Su Yi Shui, this wayward disciple, sacrificed his own cultivation for a chance to save Master’s life. If we look at it from this perspective, we are ashamed to be Master’s disciples!”</p>
<p>Wang Suizhi’s face reddened slightly as he listened, and at this moment, Zeng Yi looked at the man playing the zither, gazing intently at the woman smiling sweetly. Zeng Yi couldn’t help but sigh softly, “So all our Master needs in this lifetime is happiness. We disciples shouldn’t interfere too much.”</p>
<p>Wang Suizhi, still not reconciled to this, shook his head and sighed, “I’m worried that Su Yi Shui has lost his memories about Master and has returned to his reckless ways from when he first joined the sect. What if he suddenly does something that harms Master?”</p>
<p>Zeng Yi was actually most worried about this as well, which was why he had secretly left with Master back then.</p>
<p>However, it seemed now that this worry was somewhat unnecessary. Although Su Yi Shui had lost his memories, his care for Master hadn’t diminished in the slightest.</p>
<p>It would seem that the bond between these two couldn’t be easily broken by a soul-cleansing talisman, so Zeng Yi was taking things step by step.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The close relationship of these two, didn’t escape the notice of Qiao lian and her husband.</p>
<p>Although they were from a rural background, they weren’t fools. They hadn’t been to the Western Mountain before, so they did not see the daily interactions between master and disciple before. Now, they were alerted to this situation where this master and disciple were… being too close?</p>
<p>The couple wasn’t going to let things develop naturally like Zeng Yi.</p>
<p>Their daughter was young and if she was captivated by this kind of handsome master immortal, it would be entirely understandable given her limited experience and world view. But what was this master immortal’s intention? They couldn’t let their daughter be taken advantage of just because she is young, and if he thought he did not have to take any responsibility!</p>
<p>So the couple discussed in private and decided to have a frank discussion with Master Su about their daughter’s marriage.</p>
<p>Before talking to Immortal Su, the couple first asked their daughter for her thoughts.</p>
<p>Ranran felt that her situation with Su Yi Shui was too complicated. Telling her adoptive parents would only add to their worries, so she casually brushed it off, “Mother, you and father are thinking too much. My relationship with master… is not what you think.”</p>
<p>Qiao lian glared “Not like what? I saw with my own eyes that you and Su Yi Shui were holding hands and strolling by the pond, and Su Yi Shui even picked leaves off your head for you. Does a master and disciple normally behave this way?”</p>
<p>Ranran,*hearing that that was all Qiao lian saw, felt relieved. “I thought you saw something else… Isn’t this normal? Master is kind to other disciples like this too… Mother, I need to go practice now.”<br/><em>*LOOOL if her mother saw them kissing she would do something drastic </em></p>
<p>Ranran didn’t want to say more, so she said she needed to go practice on the back mountain, and then she ran off.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But Qiao lian felt that something was not right with what her daughter said, and she had actually sighed in relief after hearing her words. Could it be that these two had done something even more inappropriate in private?</p>
<p>She thought that her daughter was naive in her youth, unaware that she was being taken advantage of.</p>
<p>So the couple decided to confront Su Yi Shui directly in the study. After chatting idly for a while about all kinds of matters, the couple exchanged a glance and mustered up the courage and solemnly told Su Yi Shui that they want to leave with their daughter.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui had asked the couple to come to Xishan because Ranran had been worried about the safety of her adoptive parents. After all there have been monsters roaming around and they live in a secluded place which didn’t feel very safe. </p>
<p>But he didn’t expect the couple to be so ungrateful and suddenly want to take Ranran away.</p>
<p>Su Yishui turned them down flatly without any hesitation.</p>
<p><em>Ridiculous! </em>Just because they were Ranran’s adoptive parents, they thought they could make decisions like this? He was the one who gave Xue Ranran this life. If they had to talk about who had the right to decide, <em>he</em> was Ranran’s rebirth parent, not this rural couple!</p>
<p>Qiao lian also guessed that Su Yi Shui wasn’t about to let go easily, so she immediately brought up conditions “Immortal Master, I’ve also noticed these past days that you have been far too attentive to our daughter… But she’s all grown up now, and you should be more cautious about gossip. Speaking hypothetically, if you really like our daughter and want to marry her, its not impossible. But my daughter is from a proper family, if you have the intentions, you should first go through a matchmaker and then see what our family thinks!”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui now recalled the conversation with the couple just now, which he originally thought was just idle chitchat. Now every sentence had some hidden meaning behind it.</p>
<p>For example, Qiao lian asked about properties and businesses besides the Western Mountain, which was probing into his financial background.</p>
<p>The carpenter asked about his age, how often he got up at night, and if he had symptoms of frequent urination, weak waist or kidney deficiency. They were worried if he was too old and weak to be able to make their daughter *happy.<br/>*<em>R21 stuff lol</em></p>
<p>Additionally, Qiao lian was particularly concerned if he had previous marriages, fearing that Ranran might inadvertently end up a concubine.</p>
<p>The couple had asked about all these details, only then did they bring up marriage for their adopted daughter, showing that they had been planning meticulously and being exceptionally astute, for their daughter’s future.</p>
<p>“She entered Xishan as my disciple, seeking longevity. This has nothing to do with what you’re saying.” Su Yi Shui coldly refused.</p>
<p>Qiao lian noticed that this Master Su seemed much colder towards them compared to before. Was he that confident now that he had taken advantage of their innocent daughter with his honeyed words?</p>
<p>Thinking this, Qiao lian’s boldness surged again, and she spoke more bluntly, “Master Su, you are not the ideal son-in-law in our hearts either. Ranran is now at the age of blossoming youth, and finding a partner of similar age would be most suitable. As for you… although you have the appearance of an immortal and look young, your age is still rather old. Our daughter has limited cultivation and may not be able to withstand the passing of time like you to remain young. So if you have no intention, you should make it clear to our daughter. Although our family is not as wealthy as yours, we are not the kind of people who would sell their daughter to be a concubine. Tomorrow we’ll take our daughter down the mountain, and we won’t trouble your further guidance!”</p>
<p>This was completely the attitude of a rural woman. If the marriage talks didn’t work out, she actually made a veiled insult about his age and health?</p>
<p>Based on Su Yi Shui’s temperament, he would have immediately got up and left. But for some reason, as the words reached his lips, they changed into “…Was it Ranran who asked you to propose marriage?”</p>
<p>Qiao lian thought for a moment and felt that it would be better to show unity as a family of three. She said, “Of course, Ranran has this intention. She has liked watching others getting married since she was young. Now that she’s of age, naturally she wants to become a proper wife through a formal marriage!”</p>
<p><em>So it was because Xue Ranran couldn’t wait and begged her parents to propose to him </em>— Su Yi Shui thought this and suddenly felt much more comfortable.</p>
<p>Even though she always said she wasn’t sentimental to remain at Xishan, wasn’t there still a hidden desire for marriage in her heart?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Actually, before this, he had never intended to marry a fellow cultivator.</p>
<p>When he got engaged to Wen Hongshan, it was to fulfill his mother’s wish for him to get married. Later, when the marriage fell through, he didn’t feel any regret. Since then, he had never thought of adding any burdens to his life.</p>
<p>The fact that Xue Ranran was so eager to marry him wasn’t unexpected to him. After all, the admiration in the young girl’s eyes was unmistakable; she should have feelings for him…</p>
<p>Considering that she was still quite adorable now and not as annoying as she had been in her past life, and they also had been somewhat intimate, to take her reputation into consideration, marrying her in a formal ceremony… wasn’t out of the question.</p>
<p>After all, she had a stubborn nature, and even though she had improved significantly in this life, if left unattended, her true nature might emerge and become uncontrollable.</p>
<p>There were many things that a master couldn’t control. For example, chatting endlessly with handsome junior brothers, smiling at unfamiliar men, leaving abruptly from the Western Mountain over trivial disagreements, etc. If she married him, then these bad habits could all be corrected.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, marrying her would also have many benefits.</p>
<p>Anyway, whether he married a fellow cultivator or not didn’t matter to him. Leaving this position vacant was also useless. So he might as well marry her, so it would be justified *to manage her in the future.<br/><em>*manage her? Su Yi Shui are you trying to manage a celebrity LOL</em></p>
<p>In a moment, Su Yi Shui weighed the pros and cons quickly and finally spoke, “I wonder if you two elders want me to find a matchmaker for the proposal? What about my senior brother Zeng Yi? He has spent some time with both of you and should be trustworthy as a guarantor for the match.”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Qiao lian’s biggest worry now was that her daughter was no longer chaste, and that this darn Master Su would use that against her. So when negotiating today, although her tone was loud, there was also some masked hesitation.</p>
<p>She had mocked Su Yi Shui for being old and weak earlier, but seeing his appearance looking like he was only nineteen, with his exceptionally handsome features that even at her age, she couldn’t help but take a few more looks at him.</p>
<p>Moreover, Su Yi Shui’s financial strength is unexpectedly formidable, with five or six shops in the capital alone, and countless other properties elsewhere, truly a hidden wealthy man.</p>
<p>Her daughter was beautiful, but she was still just a poor rural girl. Marrying someone as capable as Su Yi Shui was quite out of her league.</p>
<p>If she hadn’t been worried that her daughter was not sensible and had become too intimate with him too soon, Qiao lian wouldn’t have had the nerve to shamelessly force this marriage.</p>
<p>She never expected Su Yi Shui to be so forthright, and readily agree to find a matchmaker.</p>
<p>This made her and her husband extremely relieved, they exhaled a long breath and each sat back in their chairs. When Qiao lian recovered, she looked over Su Yi Shui again, now looking at him like her son-in-law, feeling very satisfied everywhere she looked!</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui even wrote an engagement proposal on the spot as proof for the couple. As for the *three letters and six ceremonies, he will follow up with it, and not one will be missed out.<br/>*三书六聘 : 聘书、礼书、迎书  <em>engagement letter, gifts letter, welcoming letter</em><br/>纳采、问名、纳吉、纳征、请期、亲迎  <br/><em>Accept proposal, Confirm name, Accepting good news, Accepting betrothal gifts, Choosing wedding date, welcoming the bride</em></p>
<p>After settling this, the couple happily went to find their daughter.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran was gathering Qi cultivation by the lotus pond, lightly standing on the lotus pod with her slender foot, nourishing herself on the water’s surface like a dragonfly.</p>
<p>But when she heard her mother joyfully tell her that they had discussed and finalized on her impending marriage with Immortal Su, Ranran’s qi sank, and she plopped into the water.</p>
<p>When she emerged from the lotus pond, her head was covered with green lotus leaves. She wiped her wet face and exclaimed, “Mother, what nonsense are you all talking about? When did I say I want to marry Su Yi Shui?”</p>
<p>Qiao lian thought her daughter, was just being young and shy, so she continued happily, “Immortal Su readily agreed. Not only did he ask Mr Zeng to act as a guarantor, he also provided his bazi and a proposal for us on the spot. This is not a joke!”</p>
<p>Of course, Ranran knew that once the proposal was made, it wasn’t a joke. But for Su Yi Shui to do this… wasn’t it because of the pressure from Qiao lian and her husband?</p>
<p>She couldn’t explain clearly to her ecstatic parents at the moment, and could only go back to change into dry clothes and summon up courage to go ask Su Yi Shui what he was thinking and why he had hastily agreed to Qiao lian’s demands.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Su Yi Shui was preparing medicine in the alchemy room. When he saw that Ranran had come over, he only cast one glance at her and continued with his work.</p>
<p>“My parents don’t know our complicated situation. You don’t have to take what they said to heart. I will explain to them properly, and your engagement letter doesn’t have to count.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Su Yi Shui slowly put down the medicine bottle in his hand and looked up, saying, “It’s true that you are *not young anymore. If you’ve considered getting married, just tell me directly. Since I’ve kissed you, naturally I have to take responsibility for you. They are your adoptive parents and I’m now your master, we are all your elders, so discussing your marriage is reasonable and justified. Since it’s already decided, why shouldn’t it count?”<br/>*<em>even if its xianxia, in their world people can get married by 15</em></p>
<p>Ranran stared wide-eyed, almost getting ensnared in Su Yi Shui’s logic.</p>
<p>Perhaps her wide-eyed look was cute, as Su Yi Shui expressionlessly tapped her nose with the medicine bottle. “Although cultivators are not concerned with trivial matters, we still have some intimacy between us. Your parents asking me to marry you is also reasonable.”</p>
<p>Most of the time, Ranran was very accommodating to her capricious master.</p>
<p>But in matters of marriage, she had a stubborn belief: “Marriage should be based on mutual love between a man and a woman, promising each other eternity. But you have completely forgotten the past and only remember my shortcomings from my previous life. I’m afraid that even if you have a very slight affection for me right now, it only came about after we got along for some time. I don’t want you to settle like this. You already said that cultivators have a longer lifespan than ordinary people. If we regret it in the future, should we divorce, or do we kill each other for enlightenment? I don’t want to become resentful partners with you… I will tear up that engagement letter, and my parents won’t talk nonsense to you like that again!”</p>
<p>After saying this, Ranran turned around to leave but Su Yi Shui grabbed her arm. “Are you saying you don’t really like me, and all the intimacy before was just meaningless flirtation?”</p>
<p>When he asked this, Su Yi Shui’s brows were furrowed with anger, thinking that even after her reincarnation, she was still only here to play games in the mortal world! If she didn’t like him, why could she chat and play the qin happily and be intimate with him?</p>
<p>Ranran had to use her true qi to stop herself from vomiting blood out of exasperation “It’s not that I don’t like you, it’s that you don’t like me! If you really liked me, why can’t you remember me?”</p>
<p>After saying this, Ranran sadly ran out. Elder Jiu had said that if the love was deep enough, the soul-cleansing charm would resolve on its own.</p>
<p>But Su Yi Shui still had not recovered his memories from both her lives, which could only mean that although he had some affection for Xue Ranran, it wasn’t the deep love he had for Mu Qingge.</p>
<p>If that was the case, why force a marriage proposal? Ranran didn’t want to become resentful partners with Su Yi Shui, so it was better not to marry him.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But her abrupt departure left Su Yi Shui feeling frustrated by himself.</p>
<p>Initially, he didn’t have a strong desire to marry either. But he felt that since he had kissed Xue Ranran and she was still an innocent young girl, her parents coming to hold him accountable, as a man, he couldn’t shirk his responsibilities.</p>
<p>Moreover, whether as his disciple or his future wife, she would have to cultivate with him. Other than the marriage certificate, nothing else would change.</p>
<p>But he never expected that this darn girl would blame him for not remembering, as if it were his sin. Did she really expect him to die for her like what Elder Jiu had said?</p>
<p>If that were the case, her name in the cultivation world, might as well be called *”Wang Men Widow”!<br/>*望门寡 <em>is when a girl is engaged and her fiance passes</em> away</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui originally had a nonchalant attitude towards marriage. But now, *he was the one so keen to marry, and so he found himself inexplicably determined to see it through. <br/>*剃头挑子一头热 <em>when doing something, one person is very passionate and the other is indifferent</em></p>
<p><em>If she didn’t want to marry him, who else would she want to marry? He wasn’t about to allow her to harm others!</em></p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>In the end, that marriage proposal did not get torn up. Su Yi Shui got to Qiao lian and her husband first and said told them that Ranran was still young and playful. If she was to tell her parents that the engagement was not valid, he would go along with her wishes for now. However, that marriage proposal would always be valid for him. So until Ranran changes her mind, he asked the couple to keep it safe.</p>
<p>If Ranran wanted to marry someone else in the future… it wasn’t impossible, but she must cancel the engagement with him first.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui’s tolerant and generous attitude once again won the favor of Qiao lian and her husband.</p>
<p>Later, as Immortal Su had predicted, Ranran came and immaturely insisted on canceling the engagement. Qiao lian and her husband had spoiled her since childhood, and their initial pressure for marriage was out of concern for their daughter being taken advantage of.</p>
<p>But now, since their daughter didn’t want to marry, it was a different matter. Although Immortal Su was indeed extraordinary and capable, he was getting older, and they didn’t know if he was truly as good as he appeared.</p>
<p>They would wait for their daughter to think things through before letting her marry.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Afterward, Ranran tentatively told Su Yi Shui that her parents wouldn’t give her the marriage proposal, but he didn’t have to worry, because she would never use the proposal to cause trouble for him.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui glanced at her indifferently. “There are two copies of the marriage proposal, and your parents have stamped and signed them. If you go back on your word and want to marry someone else, you’ll have to bring that man before me and let me have a look!”</p>
<p>As he said this, Su Yi Shui’s voice was not loud, but Ranran felt a brewing murderous intent in his words, as if he was ready to act on it anytime.</p>
<p>Ranran asked cautiously, “And after you have a look?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui didn’t expect her to continue with this, and wondered if there really was a dog of a man she intended to bring before him. So he couldn’t help but look at her coldly “Xue Ranran, you can bring him over to try me.”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui rarely used her full name like that, and Ranran could tell that his words were highly-charged. She couldn’t help feeling a little sweet inside her heart, so she tugged at his sleeve and said “I don’t want to marry anyone else but you…”</p>
<p>After hearing this, Su Yi Shui couldn’t help but feel his anger dissipate in a moment, but at the same time, he cursed in his heart: Not wanting to marry yet still teasing him, she hadn’t changed her ways from her past life at all. If he were still a sixteen or seventeen-year-old youth, wouldn’t she have toyed with his emotions and made him lose his soul completely? From this, he could tell that he had been bewitched by her ways twenty years ago, which was definitely forgivable. After all, the experienced enchantress had beguiled the ignorant youth that he was back then…</p>
<p>As he was thinking this, Ranran said in a low voice again, “I hope you could remember, not because I want you to die for me. If something really happens to you, how can I live on? But I just hope you would understand clearly why you are marrying me and I also know why I am marrying you, so we won’t become resentful partners.”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui felt that Ranran’s thoughts were too naive and childish, but he finally relaxed his stiff posture, and allowed Ranran to lean on his shoulder. He said “You’re still young and don’t understand that most resentful partners in the world all had their period of sweet romance, before they turned resentful. So resentful partners usually didn’t start out because they didn’t think things through, but they just couldn’t withstand the test of time.”</p>
<p>Ranran blinked her eyes, saying softly, “So, if we cultivators become immortal partners, wouldn’t we face endless time and inevitably become resentful?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui thought for a moment and said very seriously “If your father’s worries about me, having an aching back and weak kidneys, getting up too many times at night, were true, then resentment will most likely grow.”</p>
<p><em>Hmm…</em></p>
<p>Ranran blinked, even though she was a very intelligent woman, she was unable to understand the meaning behind Su Yi Shui’s serious words. </p>
<p>Seeing that she didn’t seem to understand, Su Yishui leaned over and whispered a few sentences in her ear.</p>
<p>Ranran’s fair face immediately flushed red, and she stared speechlessly at Su Yi Shui. She then stood up stiffly, and kicked her former wayward disciple in anger before rushing out.</p>
<p>She couldn’t believe her ears. How could such a proper man like Su Yi Shui say such improper words?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But that night, Xue Ranran tossed and turned, unable to sleep. Eventually, when she finally fell asleep, she dreamt of herself in a red dress, covered in a red veil, being led by *Su Yi Shui into a red silk candlelit bridal chamber.<br/>*男人 <em>in the novel, the author liked to refer to Su Yi Shui sometimes as ‘the man’</em>.</p>
<p>Ranran blushed furiously and hesitated to recall the events in her dream after the candles were extinguished. But the dream was both tiring and long, with someone whispering in her ear, “If I don’t exert some effort, what if you start to feel resentful?”</p>
<p>When she woke up in the morning, Ranran hid under the covers, and closed her eyes to secretly remember her dream for just a moment.</p>
<p>Then, Qiu Xier came to urge her to get up for breakfast, and when she saw Ranran’s blushing face from the window, she jokingly said, “Junior sister, why are you still in bed? Was raunchy dreams keeping you?”</p>
<p>Ranran threw a pillow at her, feeling a sudden panic — was she that obvious? If Su Yi Shui noticed later, what should she do?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>
<p>This chapter made me laugh so much, especially how Su Yi Shui was acting nonchalant at first but later became so ready to ‘put a ring on it’ even though he can’t remember why or how he loves Mu Qingge or Ranran lol <br/>Who was the one who just said very loftily, that love is not something to be measured by pros and cons… seeing how he is convincing himself that yes, its going to be great to marry Xue Ranran… just so hilarious…</p>
<p>Also Su Yi Shui  was unexpectedly <s>old-fashioned</s>, pure of heart regarding ‘taking responsibility’. Even if he had been some cold blooded, ruthless former demon lord, he was like a switch when it comes to feelings. He only has ‘On’ or ‘Off’ <em>hahaha</em></p>
<p>Talk about rapid advancement! Who would have thought they would get engaged before Su Yi Shui solves his problem with the soul-cleansing talisman? lol<br/>Did you see this coming at all?</p>
<p>Ranran’s adoptive parents are just such a hoot. I am worried they have been written out of the drama though, since the trailer had said Ranran had ‘nowhere to go’… that made it sound like she was an orphan? I guess we will only know when the drama airs…</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">李代桃僵   SUBSTITUTIONS</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Ranran was worried for nothing. At breakfast in the early morning, Su Yi Shui was already surrounded and hounded by his future prospective in-laws.</p>
<p>Now with Qiao lian helping in the kitchen, it was very convenient for her to prepare hearty and  nourishing dishes for her future son-in-law. This early morning, Su Yi Shui was treated to his very own pot of lamb, baizhu and yam porridge. The porridge was served with stir-fried pieces of sea cucumber as a side dish, all extremely beneficial for men’s health.</p>
<p>When Gao Cang tried to take some, Qiao lian stopped him and said, “You’re young and vigorous, and not yet married. You don’t need to eat this. Too much tonics for you might lead to nosebleeds!”</p>
<p>After this remark, everyone looked at Su Yi Shui and then at Xue Ranran.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran ignored everyone’s gaze and hurriedly ate the porridge with the bowl blocking her face. She couldn’t wait to leave the table.</p>
<p>She would definitely have to talk to her mother about this later. She couldn’t afford to be embarrassed like this. What did Su Yi Shui’s kidney health have to do with her? Being so anxious, wouldn’t it lead to misunderstandings from others?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But someone else wanted to talk to her too, and that was Yutong. Ever since she found out that Ranran was the reincarnation of Mu Qingge, Yutong’s gaze towards the young girl had become particularly complex.</p>
<p>She was quite prejudiced against Mu Qingge’s life, yet she was very fond of the present Xue Ranran. This conflicting feelings of affection and dislike left Yutong unsure of how to act around Ranran.</p>
<p>In the end, she could only try to avoid conversations to prevent awkwardness.</p>
<p>But now, under pressure from the Xue Couple, Su Yi Shui had already signed the engagement letter. When Yu Tong heard this news while helping in the kitchen, she was also very shocked.</p>
<p>Considering this, Yutong felt she couldn’t remain silent anymore. She needed to have a deeper conversation with Xue Ranran to understand the situation better and before she could entrust her master to her.</p>
<p>So she solemnly pulled Ranran aside into the bamboo grove and asked her with a serious expression if she was only toying with the master?”</p>
<p>Ranran rubbed her temples and sighed, “Your master is still shrewd even after being affected by the soul-cleansing talisman. As for my parents, they are straightforward and simple people in their actions. They have misunderstood my relationship with Shifu, which was why they hastily proposed this marriage. Don’t worry, I’ve already talked to them. I won’t be marrying Su Yi Shui…”</p>
<p>Yutong quickly interrupted her, “You have misunderstood. I’m not here to blame you. Twenty years ago, I was still young and prone to biases, so I have said some bad things about you unintentionally. Please forgive me.”</p>
<p>Yutong wasn’t foolish. After all these twists and turns, she had a better understanding of Mu Qingge’s character from twenty years ago. If she had been a little older back then, she might have been able to admire Mu Qingge like Zhou Feihua.</p>
<p>Now she finally understood why her master had been so depressed over the past twenty years. If these two could become a happy couple, it would fulfill the master’s long-standing wish, and everything will be settled nicely.</p>
<p>Moreover, she had some selfish motivations too, she wanted to tell Ranran about them now “In the past, my brother and I have always watched over our master. Besides the master-servant bond, it was also because our master was lonely and had no one else in this world. But if he has you as a companion, he won’t be alone anymore. Then, I can completely let go of my worries and resign from serving our master.”</p>
<p>Ever since her son and lover were threatened at the foot of the mountain last time, Yutong’s mindset had changed significantly.</p>
<p>Becoming an immortal was indeed desirable, but gradually watching her beloved grow up, even grow old was also an unattainable happiness for immortals. </p>
<p>Yutong felt guilty about her son and lover, so she had long abandoned the idea of cultivating for immortality and wanted to find an opportunity to leave the mountain and hold a long-delayed wedding with her lover.</p>
<p>And now, Ranran marrying the master was an opportune moment. So when Yutong approached Xue Ranran this time, it was somewhat like a mother remarrying, entrusting her responsibilities before she left.</p>
<p>Additionally, Yu Tong had not talked to Su Yi Shui about this yet. She was worried about the reactions of the master and her brother. If they disagreed, even if she felt reluctant to leave the father and son duo alone at the foot of the mountain, she couldn’t just leave on her own.</p>
<p>However, Ranran thought this was a good thing. Yutong’s son was still young, not yet seven, and was at an age when he needed his mother. She readily agreed to help Yutong talk to Su Yi Shui about this, so that Yutong wouldn’t feel embarrassed in front of the master and couldn’t bring it up.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When Ranran brought this up with Su Yishui, he responded seriously, “When she’s gone, who will take care of me?”</p>
<p>Ranran was grinding ink for him at that moment. She hadn’t expected him to say something so *crude, “So, just because you lack someone to take care of you, you’re preventing a family reunion?”<br/>*虎狼之词 用来指一些词语一旦说出口，就变得不纯洁了。<br/><em>Words that can be misconstrued to be vulgar</em></p>
<p>While Su Yi Shui transcribed his medicine formulae, he continued indifferently, “She was ready to leave because you were going to marry me. If you don’t marry me, can she leave with peace of mind?”</p>
<p>Ranran blinked, understanding his meaning. Goodness, so the main culprit preventing Yutong’s family happiness turned out to be herself?</p>
<p>She probably did not teach this ability to shift blame to this rebellious disciple in her past life. Ranran’s hand paused as she looked at Su Yi Shui’s handsome profile and asked, “Are you… forcing me to marry you?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui gave a cold laugh and organized his stack of finished prescriptions, “I’m not some rogue from your village who can’t find a wife. I don’t care if you want to marry or not.”</p>
<p>Although he spoke lightly, the slight frown and pouting expression showed that he was clearly annoyed.</p>
<p>Ranran chuckled, playfully rolled her eyes, and said mischievously, “Then, will you agree to let Yu Tong leave the mountain, and I’ll seriously consider our marriage?”</p>
<p>This time, Su Yi Shui snorted coldly and didn’t speak further. Ranran picked up her small brush and continued copying the prescriptions.</p>
<p>The enemy Xishan faced this time is the Fantien Sect, which has not been seen in the world for a long time. This kind of demonic sect is full of evil followers, so precautions must be taken. In recent days, the alchemy furnaces in the Western Mountain have been continuously burning to produce a batch of elixirs quickly.</p>
<p>The master and disciple were busy transcribing the prescriptions to distribute to the others.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But after writing for a while, Su Yi Shui suddenly spoke again, “How long are you going to consider?”</p>
<p>Ranran was dizzy from copying, so she exclaimed “Ah?” in confusion, but when she saw Su Yi Shui glaring fiercely at her, she suddenly realized he was continuing their earlier conversation.</p>
<p>How should she answer this? She didn’t know how long she needed to consider either. But her delayed response clearly displeased the big demon lord again.</p>
<p>With a cold face, he stood up, and left the study coldly with a graceful wave of his sleeves.</p>
<p>Ranran called after him, but he didn’t even turn his head, truly even more stubborn than a child.</p>
<p>Ranran thought he would take out his anger on Yutong. But unexpectedly, Yutong came running happily later, telling her that the master had agreed to let her descend the mountain. Even her dowry for the wedding would be provided by Xishan.</p>
<p>Yuchen, upon hearing that her sister was getting married, couldn’t help but cry even as a proud man. He felt that, as an elder brother, he had owed his sister too much. So much so that she was only getting married at this *old age.<br/>*<em>Yutong should be only 22 lol she had the child at 16 and her son was getting on 7</em><br/>**<em>So for reference Ranran is 18-19 which was why her parents were like.. you are getting old!</em></p>
<p>This crying turned into an unstoppable flood of tears, causing Su Yi Shui to finally say, “Why don’t …you go down the mountain too to live with your sister, and get married and have children?”</p>
<p>Yuchen immediately fell to his knees “Master, I will stay by your side for the rest of my life! Even if you drive me away, I won’t leave!”<br/>*<em>hahahah at this point I wonder if Su Yi Shui just wanted to have a 2 person couple life with his Ranran</em><br/><em>Get a clue already Yu Chen</em></p>
<p>After saying that, he burst into tears again, as if a loyal dog was about to be abandoned, crying out of fear and worry.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Yutong’s marriage was a joyful event, which allowed the tense nerves of those on Xishan to finally relax a little.</p>
<p>Ranran personally went down the mountain with her fellow disciples to buy Yutong’s dowry and other necessary items.</p>
<p>However, when they returned to the Western Mountain, a figure covered in blood suddenly was came out from the side of the mountain road.</p>
<p>Everyone thought another demonic being had come to the Western Mountain and jumped back in fright.</p>
<p>But Ranran saw clearly that this person… wasn’t it Elder Wen Chunhui of the Kongshan Sect?</p>
<p>She was the elder who took over major matters in the sect after Wen Hongshan met her demise. Ranran had dealt with this elder before when she retrieved the stolen horses from Gao kan. She felt that this elder was different from people like Kaiyuan Elder and had a fair and upright character.</p>
<p>At this moment, she was covered in wounds, clearly very seriously injured within an inch of her life.</p>
<p>Ranran asked, “Elder Wen, what happened? Why are you in such a miserable state?”</p>
<p>Wen Chunhui had just taken a sip of water given by Qiu Xi’er, wiped the fresh blood from her face, and said in a trembling voice, “The three major sects have been nearly annihilated, not a single elite disciple remains. Retribution… could this be retribution?”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>She was present when they besieged Mu Qingge back then. She remembered the woman dressed in fiery red, standing on the mountain top, watching the three major sects that were besieging her. She had said loudly, “I, Mu Qingge, am not ashamed before heaven and earth. I have dedicated myself to saving the common people. It’s just that some of you intentionally obscure the truth, unable to discern right from wrong. Although I do not fear death, I fear that you will suffer the consequences of your ignorance in the future. At that time, I’m afraid the orthodox world will be in chaos and no longer exist!”</p>
<p>At that time, Mu Qingge’s words were clear and convincing. However, the people eager to eliminate the demoness didn’t take her words to heart.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, her words which resembled a curse were slowly being fulfilled more than twenty years later.</p>
<p>At this moment, Wen Chunhui looked at Xue Ranran, the reincarnation of Mu Qingge, with regret and self-blame, almost unable to continue her next breath.</p>
<p>Ranran hurriedly gave her a Soul Soothing pill, stabilizing her heart meridian temporarily.</p>
<p>But Ranran didn’t let anyone carry her up the mountain. Because according to Wen Chunhui, she had just experienced a fierce battle with the Fan Tian Sect.</p>
<p>The Fan Tian Sect was so sinister that no one could guarantee whether Wen Chunhui had been affected or if there were any demonic things on her body.</p>
<p>So Ranran thought it was more prudent to temporarily settle her in the thatched hut at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>When Su Yi Shui and the others arrived, Wen Chunhui weakly recounted her previous experience.</p>
<p>It turned out that when demonic creatures were rampant everywhere, the three major sects also had the idea of revitalizing themselves. After all, in the previous clashes between the righteous and demonic forces, the three major sects suffered heavy losses, and their reputation was in jeopardy.</p>
<p>So led by Elder Kaiyuan, they decided to take advantage of the extermination of demonic creatures to rebuild their reputation and recruit a new batch of talents to continue the prosperity of their sects.</p>
<p>Initially, this plan was sound. Although these demonic creatures were formidable, they were all creatures of the Netherworld, and had been recorded in ancient texts. If they were careful and vigilant, there was nothing to fear. If they couldn’t win, they could escape, which was easier than facing the generals of the demonic sect.</p>
<p>With this plan in mind, the three major sects displayed their banners high, and their entire journey was in high-spirits and well publicized.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>However, when they gathered to capture the Nine-Headed Monster Python causing trouble in Python Mountain, something unexpected happened.</p>
<p>Because the Nine-Headed Monster Python had been eating many locals, its body had grown enormous and it couldn’t hide in the mountains anymore, making it easy to find.</p>
<p>At that time, Elder Kaiyuan intended to let his Jiuhua Sect take the lead. So after injuring the snake’s tail, he felt quite confident and brought local officials from the Prefecture and County to set up a viewing platform at the foot of the mountain, inviting officials to admire their righteous acts of subduing demons and monsters.</p>
<p>They also bought a lot of firecrackers, hired drummers and gong players in preparations for slaughtering the monster. This way, when they carried it down, while beating the drums, setting off firecrackers, they would create an atmosphere of monster subduing heroes.</p>
<p>All these were Elder Kaiyuan’s idea. He had also heard about Xishan subduing the water demons. What was originally a good thing to boost their reputation turned into a mess by those few ignorant people from Xishan.</p>
<p>It would have been fine to just subdue the water demons and hand them over to the local authorities for recognition and commendation.</p>
<p>Instead, the stupid fools from Xishan ended up offending the officials just to save a few villagers who had been demonized.</p>
<p>In the end, it seemed that the local people had complained in private, blaming those from Xishan for letting those who had been possessed go free. They didn’t know if these people would become possessed again in the future.</p>
<p>Elder Kaiyuan has learnt a lesson from the “foolishness” of Xishan and decided not to do anything that was laborious and thankless, so he made ready to just do enough superficial work.</p>
<p>But just when everything was ready and only awaited the final step, Elder Kaiyuan and the people from the other two major sects didn’t expect that an accident would happen. The giant snake that was supposed to be captured suddenly swelled up as if it had absorbed some immortal elixir, like a colossal dragon, it devoured several disciples from the three major sects on the spot. After absorbing their cultivation, the nine-headed monster python even grew thin yet huge wings behind its back, soaring into the sky and covering the sun.</p>
<p>By that time, Elder Kaiyuan knew that his plan had backfired, so he disregarded the officials who had been invited to watch the show at the foot of the mountain and tried to escape using earth escape.</p>
<p>He was in a sorry state, not able to escape yet, when Wei Jiu and the people from Crimson Gate arrived just in time.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu was currently cooperating happily with Su Yu, and like the three major sects, he also planned to take advantage of this opportunity to establish a righteous reputation, elevate Crimson Sect’s name, and eventually absorb the three major sects into his sect.</p>
<p>So after Elder Kaiyuan messed up the scene of killing the monster Python, Wei Jiu descended like a divine soldier, using extraordinary force to chop off all nine heads of the snake.</p>
<p>The firecrackers and the loud gongs and drums prepared by Elder Kaiyuan became a celebration for Crimson Gate’s Excellency Wei’s triumph.</p>
<p>The three major sects were crestfallen, originally intending to show off but ending up with humiliation.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>However, Elder Kaiyuan had always been thick-skinned. He claimed that their three major sects laid the foundation for Crimson Gate’s final glory, so he plastered a fake smile and bantered with Wei Jiu.</p>
<p>Even the bodies of ordinary snakes could be considered treasures, let alone this nine-headed monster snake, which could provide materials for alchemy and cultivation. Elder Kaiyuan didn’t want Wei Jiu to take it all it, so he insisted on demanding a share.</p>
<p>Wen Chunhui had her pride. She had already lost so miserably fighting the monster python, how could she stay to share the spoils?</p>
<p>So she didn’t wait for Wei Jiu’s mockery and led her disciples to prepare to leave. It was because she led her disciples a few steps away in time that they narrowly escaped a bizarre calamity later on.</p>
<p>Just as the people from the other major sects argued with Crimson Gate, preparing to divide the large python, the severed heads suddenly exploded, splattering blue blood plasma everywhere, instantly enveloping several people close to the snake in blood bubbles.</p>
<p>Inside the bubbles, people struggled desperately. The blood bubbles would cave in and swell up alternately. After a while, they burst open, with two identical people crawling out of each bubble. Strangely, each pair of people looked exactly the same.</p>
<p>When Wen Chunhui, who was standing far away, saw this scene, she felt her hair stand on end.</p>
<p>The “twins” who walked out of the blood bubbles were also surprised. They looked at each other and exclaimed “demon!” before attacking their other selves.</p>
<p>Wen Chunhui was shocked by the sudden turn of events. Each pair of people that emerged from the blood bubbles not only looked identical but also had the same voice, fighting skills, and even weapons, making it impossible to distinguish between them.</p>
<p>Multiple groups of people started fighting at the same time, chaos ensued, and it turned into a messy brawl. Wen Chunhui was in a state of confusion. Although she knew something was very wrong, she had no idea whom to help.</p>
<p>After a while, the victors from several groups gradually emerged. Those severely injured turned into a blue blood mist, which dissipated lightly with the wind.</p>
<p>As for Crimson Gate’s Wei Jiu, he was defeated by “himself” and fell into a deep ravine.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The surviving Elder Kaiyuan showed a sinister smile on his face, looked around, and then clasped his hands, addressing Wei Jiu and the others from the sects, “I didn’t expect the monster python to be so cunning, actually transforming again. Fortunately, the monsters it created were weak, and we managed to defeat them easily!”</p>
<p>The victorious people from the other sects also echoed, as if parrots repeating, “I didn’t expect the monster python to be so cunning, actually transforming again. Fortunately, the monsters it created were weak, and we managed to defeat them easily!”</p>
<p>After saying this, they all looked strangely towards Wen Chunhui who was not far away.</p>
<p>Elder Kaiyuan smiled at her and said, “Elder Wen, you are the only one left…”</p>
<p>Wen Chunhui cautiously retreated a few steps with her disciples, intending to leave. However, those people suddenly picked up the only remaining snake head and threw it at her.</p>
<p>Wen Chunhui dodged quickly with her agile skills, but several of her disciples next to her were hit. They were also wrapped in blue blood bubbles, and when the bubbles burst, they engaged in another round of infighting with themselves.</p>
<p>And the last people left standing all had the same eerie smile as Elder Kaiyuan…</p>
<p>At that moment, Elder Wen Chunhui suddenly remembered the legend about this nine-headed monster python, which said that its blood could divide human bodies, allowing evil beings to replace them.</p>
<p>In other words, the people smiling at her were no longer the same people as before!</p>
<p>Just as she realized this, Elder Wen Chunhui was surrounded and attacked by those eerie smiling people.</p>
<p>When she was heavily injured and couldn’t defend herself, she suddenly felt nothing beneath her feet, and fell down a cliff. Immediately, a large hand covered her mouth, and spiritual talismans were stuck all over her body.</p>
<p>She turned her head and saw that Wei Jiu, who had fallen down the mountain cliff earlier, was hanging on a tree branch halfway up the cliff. He used his hand to cover her mouth and then applied an invisibility charm from Elder Jiu, creating the illusion that they had fallen into the deep ravine.</p>
<p>Wen Chunhui watched with wide eyes as the  faces at the top of the cliff looked down grimly.</p>
<p>Just then, the sound of gongs and drums from below the mountain grew closer, and the officials, along with soldiers and villagers, came up the mountain to welcome the triumphant cultivators.</p>
<p>And so, those eerie beings, under the guise of the Three Great Sects and the Crimson Gate, descended from the mountain as if everything were all in order.</p>
<p>If Wei Jiu and Wen Chunhui had not miraculously survived, this entire substitution scheme would have gone completely unnoticed.</p>
<p>After those people carrying the monster python dispersed, two figures finally climbed up from halfway up the mountain.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu had endured half a lifetime of hardship, and now that he was finally about to rise, someone had impersonated him, which ignited a fire of frustration in his heart.</p>
<p>However, he was still astute. So he urged Wen Chunhui not to return to Kongshan Sect but to go to Xishan, to tell Su Yi Shui and Xue Ranran about the situation of the Three Great Sects.</p>
<p>Now, the only ones who could protect her were the people from Xishan. Wei Jiu turned and headed for the imperial palace to explain the situation to Su Yu and find a solution.</p>
<p>Before parting ways, the two of them also saw the situation below the mountain from afar.</p>
<p>At that time, Wei Jiu, in order to show off his prowess, had told Tu Jiuyuan and most of the sect members to wait at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>And now, Tu Jiuyuan was kneeling before the fake Wei Jiu, listening to his commands. The fake Wei Jiu even lightly caressed Tu Jiuyuan’s chin with his finger.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu felt like he was about to explode with anger. But he knew that the imposter had completely replicated his abilities and cultivation, and with his own serious injuries, going out now would be *pointless.<br/>*肉包子打狗 <em>hitting dogs with meat buns, useless and just feeding them</em></p>
<p>So, they both acted separately, looking for reinforcements.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Listening to Wen Chunhui’s bizarre story, the disciples from Xishan looked at each other in confusion.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier was particularly anxious and said, “This… is quite difficult. Even the real and fake Monkey King was not discernible before the Mirror of Truth. If what you said is true, and the real and fake are so alike as if they were twins, how can we distinguish between them? Moreover, you speculate that most of the members of the sects have been killed. Even if you say it, I’m afraid no one will believe it.”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui and Xue Ranran also exchanged glances. Especially Xue Ranran, who couldn’t help but lament a little. When she was first taken in as a disciple by Su Yi Shui, the Three Great Sects were still thriving, at their peak.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, nothing lasts forever. With recent setbacks to the Three Great Sects, and now with major figures being replaced, it seemed like the sects would be wiped out soon. It was no wonder Wen Chunhui was so distressed and confused.</p>
<p>Although Su Yi Shui didn’t speak, he understood that the three great sects had to be saved. Once these strange creatures, transformed from the snakes have completely taken control of the Three Great Sects, they wouldn’t spare Xishan.</p>
<p>The current plan was to strike while they were still unaware of the exposure of their plan, catch them off guard, and eliminate them first.</p>
<p>However… Su Yi Shui was never one to trust easily: was the Wen Chunhui before him real or fake?</p>
<p>Xue Ranran seemed to sense his doubts, and she had actually also thought about this. The way to verify it wasn’t that difficult, but she didn’t know if her idea was feasible.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>
<p>Something not really directly related but while we are on the ‘marriageable’ age when we watch period dramas, the main reason I guess why people used to consider 20s as ‘old’ was because of the overall life expectancy back then?</p>
<p>Perhaps due to lack of medical knowledge etc back then, according to history, even favored consorts in the palace, who should have had access to the best of everything, most do not live beyond 50 years old. This would make being in their 20s already like the mid point of their lives. </p>
<p>Something to think about. <br/>Aren’t we glad to be living in this era now? Where being in our 20s is just ‘the beginning’?</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">一正一邪   ONE GOOD, ONE EVIL</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>About this description of the nine-headed python, Ranran had read about it in the Fantian Sect Records.</p>
<p>This python had the ability to divide and transform into human forms, creating counterfeits that were indistinguishable from the real ones, effectively replacing them. However, these counterfeits had a flaw that could be detected; because they were actually condensed from yin energy, during the brief period when yin and yang alternated at midnight or noon, these counterfeits would not cast shadows.</p>
<p>So, when noon arrived, Ranran supported Wen Chunhui into the sunlight, and on the ground appeared Wen Chunhui’s clear shadow, instantly reassuring everyone.</p>
<p>After hearing Ranran’s explanation later on, Wen Chunhui sighed in relief and said, “It is good that there’s a way to distinguish them. I’m really worried that those impostors posing as the heads of the major sects will cause chaos in the cultivation world.”</p>
<p>Although she hadn’t been affected by the snake poison splitting her body, several of her disciples who went with her had been replaced. Once those impostors returned, they would certainly cause trouble in the Kongshan Sect.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When Xue Ranran and Su Yi Shui discovered that the skull of the Demon King had been stolen, they didn’t say much at the time in order to withdraw from Red Flame Mountain.</p>
<p>But after they returned, Xishan then sent letters to the major sects, explaining the theft of the Demon King’s skull and the intentions of the Fan tian Sect to revive the demon king and cause chaos. The letters also mentioned the rise of demonic creatures in various places, which are related to the revival of the Fantian Sect.</p>
<p>At that time, the major sects thought it was nonsense, believing that Xishan was being alarmist and causing panic.</p>
<p>But now, looking back, everything Xishan said had come true. Su Yi Shui and Xue Ranran were among the few clear-minded individuals in the cultivation world who actually knew what was going on. Unfortunately, no one believed them at the time.</p>
<p>Wen Chunhui was now filled with regret and remorse. Thinking about the situation, every hair on her back stood on end.</p>
<p>The ability of the Fantian Sect to destroy major sects was even more terrifying than the demonic forces like Crimson Gate sect, completely taking over without anyone noticing. The most chilling thing is what was their ultimate goal with this action?</p>
<p>At this time, the major sects had inexplicably closed their doors and forbidden people from freely going up and down the mountains. Countless carts carrying black stones were being transported up the mountains, but what exactly was on those carts remained a mystery for the time being.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>At the same time, Wei Jiu, who was now alone, also arrived at Xishan.</p>
<p>The once mighty Demon Lord hadn’t expected to come to Xishan seeking help from that person with the surname Su. So when he arrived at the foot of the mountain, he didn’t go up directly but wandered around instead.</p>
<p>In the end, he actually managed to sneak in with the crowd attending the wedding of Yu Tong.</p>
<p>On that day, with the marriage of Yu Tong, there were many relatives from the groom’s village, and everyone was in high spirits. Wei Jiu concealed his aura and specifically changed into women’s clothing. He already looked androgynous, except for being taller, he really looked like a handsome woman.</p>
<p>Then, taking advantage of the distraction, he slowly approached Ranran who was counting dowries under the corridor of the new house, and held a dagger against her waist.</p>
<p>“Little girl, don’t move, even though you’ve improved a lot, with my dagger so close, killing you wouldn’t take much effort.” he deliberately whispered close to Ranran’s ear.</p>
<p>Although Ranran was being threatened and the situation was dire, when she saw Wei Jiu dressed as a woman, she couldn’t help but burst out laughing, with her shoulders shaking.</p>
<p>Because only female relatives were allowed inside the new house, Wei Jiu had knocked out a matchmaker and changed into her clothes in order to sneak in.</p>
<p>He had just let his hair down and twisted a braid randomly, and had not applied makeup like the other village women. Was it really necessary for her to laugh so uncontrollably?</p>
<p>But before Wei Jiu could reprimand her, his wrist was firmly clasped by an iron palm, and he was lifted and pressed down to the ground.</p>
<p><br/>Su Yi Shui appeared behind him at some point, flipping him over and stepping on Wei Jiu with one foot.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu seemed to have difficulty summoning his true vitality, so he could only struggle and curse frantically.</p>
<p>Even though Su Yi Shui hadn’t regained his memory, he was fed up with Wei Jiu, especially after seeing how close Wei Jiu had gotten to Ranran earlier, not knowing if he had offended her ear with his words.</p>
<p>Thinking about this, Su Yi Shui didn’t hold back and started punching Wei Jiu without restraint, determined to teach him a lesson.</p>
<p>Just then, the happy couple rushed in amidst the crowd of friends and family.</p>
<p>The originally merry villagers were stunned into silence when they saw the renowned divine healer Su Yi Shui sitting on the back of a “woman” with disheveled hair.</p>
<p>Ranran quickly stepped in front of the two men who were stacked together, laughing and saying, “*Just making trouble in the bridal chamber!”<br/>*闹洞房 <em>is a wedding tradition</em></p>
<p>After speaking, she turned around and signaled to Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>Today was a joyous day for Yu Tong, so nothing should go wrong. Even if he wanted to teach Wei Jiu a lesson, it had to be done elsewhere.</p>
<p>So, everyone saw Su Yi Shui hoisting up the woman with long hair. In the blink of an eye, they had disappeared over the wall.</p>
<p>Ranran awkwardly tried to lighten the mood, saying, “Come on, the groom, should also carry the bride into the bridal chamber!”</p>
<p>With the cheers of Xishan disciples, they finally managed to resolve the situation.</p>
<p>As for Wei Jiu, who was carried away by Su Yi Shui, he seemed to manage to collect his breath. When he was thrown into the grassy area, he immediately cursed loudly and started grappling with Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>Ranran stood by, munching on pumpkin seeds and watching the fight. It was clear that Su Yi Shui had the upper hand, landing punches with no resistance from Wei Jiu.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu, was already weakened by the giant python’s poison, with his vitality weakening steadily. As they fought, he realized that tortoise’s son Su Yi Shui was once again trying to absorb the little true vitality he had left.</p>
<p>Infuriated, he cursed, “Su Yi Shui, are you even human? My dantian is so empty, I could raise fish in it! And you still want to absorb my true vitality! Why don’t you just stop people on the road and go rob the major sects directly! If you kill me, you won’t know the current situation of the major sects!”</p>
<p>This last sentence finally had some effect, and Su Yi Shui finally stopped beating him up.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>If Wei Jiu had any other way out, he wouldn’t have come to Xishan to disgrace himself.</p>
<p>He had originally planned to go to the capital to seek help from Su Yu.</p>
<p>After all, they had always cooperated well, and Wei Jiu was on the verge of becoming the Imperial Advisor of Daqi.</p>
<p>But that damned Su Yu, only used people when it suited him, and he would deny knowing them if things went south.</p>
<p>Especially after hearing that Wei Jiu had been contaminated with the blue blood of the nine-headed snake, Su Yu didn’t even let him into the palace. At noon, he only sent an old eunuch who had previously relayed messages for the emperor, to send a few comforting words to Wei Jiu from a distance.</p>
<p>The gist of it was that the emperor was deeply concerned about the disaster at Crimson Gate Sect and worried for Wei Jiu’s safety. His Majesty believed in Wei Jiu’s abilities and that he was sure to overcome this calamity. He assured him that if he needed money, even if the national treasury was depleted due to war, the emperor would do his best to provide some silver.</p>
<p>While the words sounded comforting, apart from silver, Su Yu offered no other help. It seemed like he was content to watch the Fan tian Sect crush the major sects, including Crimson Gate sect.</p>
<p>Ranran knew the emperor’s cunning nature well. The latter half of the Fantian Sect Records had been in Su Yu’s hands for a long time, and she believed he has memorized it well. That’s why he had Wei Jiu stand in front of the palace gate at noon to identify the real and fake through shadows. Seeing how he could rear a dragon in the palace for so many years, he was far more astute than Wei Jiu.</p>
<p>In short, the emperor was now acting very cautiously, unwilling to wade into this mess and especially unwilling to openly oppose the Fantian Sect.</p>
<p>Because the palace’s foundations had been repaired, the protective shield’s abilities had also been restored. Wei Jiu couldn’t barge into the palace to strangle the ingrate Su Yu, so he could only stand in front of the palace gate, stomping and cursing.</p>
<p>Later, he tried to return to Crimson Gate sect to find Tu Jiuyuan. However, just like the major sects, Red Flame Mountain had also closed its doors. There were no signs of the disciples coming down the mountain.</p>
<p>And those stones that were transported up the mountain were quickly piled into towers on Red Flame Mountain, towering into the clouds. But what has unnerved Wei Jiu the most was the loss of his true vitality.</p>
<p>Since the impostor hadn’t managed to kill him on the spot and had taken over completely, they used another method, turning into nightmares and draining his spiritual power whenever he fell asleep.</p>
<p>Although Wei Jiu was highly skilled, he was still in a mortal body. Even if he could go days without eating or drinking, occasionally he would meditate and fall asleep.</p>
<p>But now, every time he fell asleep, he would see someone who looked exactly like him choking him, constantly absorbing his energy.</p>
<p>After brief naps, instead of feeling refreshed, he felt a loss of energy.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu did not dare sleep along the way, his eyes were red like ripe cherries, as if they were about to bleed. Forced into this situation, he had no choice but to come to Xishan for help from Su Yi Shui and Xue Ranran.</p>
<p>To get two archenemies to help, Wei Jiu also offered some bargaining chips. He only said that he had a way to lead them back into Red Flame Mountain and investigate the truth behind the spirit tower.</p>
<p>After assuring Su Yi Shui with words and reaching a temporary ceasefire and cooperation agreement, Wei Jiu finally collapsed on the grass, wiping the blood from his mouth. He then closed his eyes, saying, “I just don’t understand why all the major sects suffered, but Xishan was spared from this disaster?”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Ranran slowly put down the pumpkin seeds in her hand. Wei Jiu’s question was quite intriguing, and actually Ranran herself couldn’t figure it out either.</p>
<p>Could it be that for the people of the Fantian Sect, Xishan was just an insignificant pawn, so they bypassed it?</p>
<p>Wei Jiu then took out a black stone from his pocket and said, “This is the stone they transported up the mountain. I managed to steal one with difficulty. See if you can find anything unusual about it?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui weighed the stone, feeling no weight in his hand. When he held it up to the sunlight, the black stone seemed to have a faint gloss.</p>
<p>But according to Wei Jiu’s words, about those stones transported up the mountain seeming to be stacked into towers, and after Red Flame Mountain suddenly appeared with a towering high tower overnight, he immediately remembered a similar record in the “Fantian Sect Records” It was said that during the time Nuwa mended the sky, she used five-colored stones, among which the black stone was light as a feather, connecting the energies of Yin and Yang. If used to build high towers, they could then reach the heavens and connect with the underworld.</p>
<p>Could it be that the towering high tower they were constructing on Red Flame Mountain was the same as the spirit tower described in the Chronicles, capable of connecting the energies of Yin and Yang?</p>
<p>What were they building these spirit towers for?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Just then, Wang Suizhi’s shopkeepers near the three major sects all sent back messages via carrier pigeons, saying they had sent people to look, and alongside the closure of the mountains by the major sects, there were also many vehicles transporting stones. Each major sect’s mountain peak had towering spirit towers built on them, visible from afar even without entering the mountains.</p>
<p>Every sect that cultivated immortality chose their cultivation grounds not on a whim but based on their own Five Elements to select a place beneficial to their cultivation.</p>
<p>So regardless of the current rise and falls of the major sects, their cultivation grounds were extremely rich in spiritual energy.</p>
<p>And now, with these impostors taking over the leadership of the major sects and beginning large-scale construction in various cultivation grounds, building black spirit towers, whatever these spirit towers were intended for, their effectiveness would surely be greatly enhanced.</p>
<p>But Wei Jiu couldn’t care about this now. All he wanted was to get a good sleep without having to worry about anything.</p>
<p>This method of stealing spiritual energy in dreams was nothing more than using similar magnetic fields to remotely absorb spiritual power when the victims were exhausted. If there were stronger magnetic fields interfering with the victim’s surroundings, the attempt would fail.</p>
<p>So Wei Jiu could only find peace in sleep by finding someone with similar or even stronger spiritual power to protect him.</p>
<p>And the only candidates now, were Xue Ranran and Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>According to Wei Jiu’s suggestion, he hoped Xue Ranran would guard and protect him—having a gentle and sweet girl by his side, even if he died in his dreams, he would be a romantic and handsome ghost under the flowers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, with just one cold look from Su Yi Shui, accompanied by the cracking sound of his knuckles, Wei Jiu’s whimsical thoughts were cut off.</p>
<p>Although Wei Jiu was down on his luck, he was still quite particular. Despite his extreme desire for sleep, he refused to compromise on his principles, and Su Yi Shui also didn’t trust leaving this scoundrel alone, allowed to roam Xishan.</p>
<p>In the end, the most refreshing sleep Wei Jiu had experienced since cultivating immortality was on Su Yi Shui’s bed. Smelling the faint sandalwood scent on his archenemy beside him, Wei Jiu slept with limbs relaxed, feeling extremely refreshed.</p>
<p>However, when two big men who were enemies to the death were left alone, the atmosphere would always be a little strange.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran knew that the Fantian Sect’s intentions were unclear at the moment and they still needed Wei Jiu’s help, so she was also afraid that Wei Jiu’s sharp tongue might anger Su Yi Shui and lead to his demise at Su Yi Shui’s hands.</p>
<p>So the next morning, as soon as she woke up, Ranran carried a basin of hot water for washing and went to Su Yi Shui’s room.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui was meditating by the bed, with his brows furrowed and eyes closed in concentration. Wei Jiu was sprawled out like a large baby.</p>
<p>So Ranran brought a chair and sat opposite her master, also entering a meditative state, passing the time and waiting quietly for the two to wake.</p>
<p>The force of invasion that Wei Jiu had mentioned about entering dreams seemed to have hidden itself this time. The night passed peacefully without any strange disturbances.</p>
<p>By mid-morning, Wei Jiu finally woke up refreshed. As he opened his eyes and glanced past Su Yi Shui beside him, he directly looked at Xue Ranran sitting opposite him with her eyes closed in meditation.</p>
<p>Upon seeing her like this, he couldn’t help but become entranced. The charm between her brows and eyes seemed to carry the air of her previous life, an air of carefree confidence rarely seen in women’s eyes. If only she would wear red clothes like she did in her past life…</p>
<p>Before Wei Jiu could indulge further in his thoughts with narrowed eyes, a tall figure had stood up, completely blocking his view.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui lowered his head, appearing concerned as he asked, “Did you sleep well?”</p>
<p>He was too close, making Wei Jiu nauseous, so he leaned back and raised his eyebrows, saying, “Thanks to Brother Su for watching over me all night.”</p>
<p>Only now did Su Yi Shui slowly stand up straight, his words suddenly cold, “Then I’ll trouble you to take away and dispose of the bedsheets and blankets from under you, I like cleanliness and can’t stand the smell of sweat.”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu felt Su Yi Shui was looking for trouble. He had clearly bathed before bed, so he was very clean!</p>
<p>He had been living in luxury on Red Flame Mountain for many years, always the one who sets the rules, even in front of Emperor Su Yu, he wouldn’t hesitate to speak his mind.</p>
<p>But now, under the eaves of Xishan, he couldn’t even sleep without Su Yi Shui, so even if he was provoked like this, he could only grit his teeth, smirk maliciously, violently pull off the bedsheets and blankets, then leave the bedroom in large strides.</p>
<p>After Wei Jiu left, Ran Ran said in a small voice, “Actually, you could have let him sleep in the guest room… This set of bedding is very good, why throw it away?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui glanced at her but remained silent.</p>
<p>This turtle son, Wei Jiu, had many demands when it came to sleeping. He needed a luxurious bed and wouldn’t settle for the practice room.</p>
<p>And the guest room was only separated by a wall from the disciples’ quarters. He didn’t want this shameless scoundrel to be too close to Ranran’s bedroom, so he let Wei Jiu sleep in his own room.</p>
<p>Who would have thought that Ranran would come over early in the morning and sit so close, allowing the shameless scoundrel to take several glances at her for no reason.</p>
<p>“The storage room still has new bedding, right? I’ll have someone bring another set.” </p>
<p>Ranran was thinking, that the covers was personally sewn by her, and the pattern of the bamboo was also chosen by Su Yi Shui from the patterns she brought.</p>
<p>But now he had forgotten about all that, so he just thought it was just an ordinary set of bedding.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran didn’t bother with these trivial matters anymore, just remained silent for a moment before saying, “I couldn’t sleep well last night, I kept thinking about the black spirit tower. So I brought the map and after looking at it, I found some suspicious places.”</p>
<p>Saying this, she took out the map she had drawn overnight, marked the locations of the three major sects and Red Flame Mountain. She then connected these four points, revealing that Xishan was surrounded by them.</p>
<p>“I asked Wen Chunhui, and she said that someone from the government came to Kongshan Sect for help, claiming that they found a nine-headed python on Yao Mountain. However, when they arrived there, they found representatives from all major sects, all claiming to have been called by the government. However, the local government officials do not know who actually sent the message. Wei Jiu, on the other hand, said that the Emperor wrote a letter instructing him to subdue the nine-headed python. But when he asked the eunuch at the palace gate, the old eunuch said that His Majesty had never sent such a letter. It’s strange that for just one snake, different people are seeking help from the three major sects and Crimson Gate sect…”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui spoke in a low voice, “So it means someone intentionally wanted these people to gather at Yao Mountain, to be trapped by the nine-headed monster.”</p>
<p>Thinking about this, both of them exclaimed in unison, “Why hasn’t that person behind the scenes sent a message to Xishan?”</p>
<p>In terms of current renown, Xishan was no less powerful than the three major sects and Crimson Gate, even vaguely showing signs of surpassing them.</p>
<p>However, the people from the Fantian Sect deliberately avoided Xishan. Why? Did they dislike Xishan’s feng shui, thinking it wasn’t worthy of building a spirit tower?</p>
<p>Or… were they actually targeting Xishan, which was being surrounded?</p>
<p>Xue Ranran took a deep breath again and said in a low voice, “You probably don’t remember the person who disguised himself as the Medicine immortal on Tianmai Mountain. He later appeared as a shepherd near the Netherworld realm flower sea, and also as the innkeeper at the foot of Red Flame Mountain. But every time he appeared, it didn’t seem like he had any malicious intent towards you and me… instead, he repeatedly reminded us to be careful, as if afraid that we would encounter danger… Is he really from the Fantian Sect, and what role is he playing in this series of events?”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Su Yi Shui remained silent. He had never felt inconvenienced by losing a memory before. But now, Ranran’s words made him furrow his brows, feeling somewhat dejected for not remembering such an important matter.</p>
<p>Of course, this  dejection rose to the extreme during breakfast time.</p>
<p>After the new disciples of Xishan had gone, there weren’t many people left in the dining hall.</p>
<p>Someone like Wei Jiu, wouldn’t normally be allowed into the dining hall. However, the unsuspecting couple, Qiao Lian and her husband, took him for a guest of Xishan and warmly welcomed him into the dining hall.</p>
<p>Although the others were well aware, they didn’t correct them, lest the couple feel embarassed. So Wei Jiu arrogantly took a seat at the dining table.</p>
<p>Because Yutong had married and moved down the mountain, breakfast was prepared by Ranran and her mother.</p>
<p>When Ranran and Su Yi Shui finally arrived at the dining hall, Wei Jiu was already eating meat buns made by Ranran, praising with a sweet mouth, “Auntie, both of your cooking skills are just as good as the Nine Flavors Hall in the capital!”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui narrowed his eyes, stood beside Wei Jiu, and said coldly, “You’re sitting in my seat.”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu lazily gave up the main seat, but as he turned around, he sat in the seat just vacated by Qiu Xier who went to get more rice.</p>
<p>This seat was good, right next to Ranran. He smiled and said, “The dried sweet potatoes you personally gave me before were delicious, but I didn’t expect everything else you make to be even tastier.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Su Yi Shui’s icy daggers shot right over, not at Wei Jiu but at Xue Ranran.</p>
<p>Wasn’t she supposed to be at odds with Wei Jiu? When did she share snacks with him?</p>
<p>Xue Ranran felt that Wei Jiu was stirring up trouble. During the trial on Tianmai Mountain, were the dried sweet potatoes she gave, dragon meat? Was it worth Wei Jiu mentioning it from time to time?</p>
<p>If she had known earlier that the boy Gui Baqian was Wei Jiu in disguise, she would have fed him bird droppings!</p>
<p>But now that Su Yi Shui had forgotten, the yellow dried sweet potatoes had practically become evidence of infidelity.</p>
<p>Qiao Lian and the carpenter also noticed something was wrong and looked at each other with uncertainty, fearing that their daughter would have some entanglement with this guy who seemed a bit feminine.</p>
<p>She had just agreed to the marriage proposal with Master Su and couldn’t afford any scandals.</p>
<p>Just at this time, Qiu Xier returned with the rice just then and found her seat taken by Wei Jiu. She immediately became annoyed, “Hey, can’t you have some etiquette as a guest? Don’t act without manners everywhere. Early in the morning, I saw you throw away the quilt that was personally sewn by Ranran for our Shifu, it’s really outrageous! That quilt was made by Ranran for a month, and now you’re taking my seat… it’s really annoying…”</p>
<p>Qiu Xier’s voice trailed off as she spoke, because on the dining table, Su Yi Shui and Wei Jiu, the big bosses, one good and one evil, were both staring straight at her.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu stared at Qiu Xier because of her disrespectful words.</p>
<p>But Su Yi Shui’s gaze carried surprise and indescribable embarrassment.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">神棍徒弟   Charlatan Disciple</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p><br/>Su Yi Shui understood now: no wonder Ranran had hesitated to say something when she saw him let Wei Jiu throw away the quilt. It turned out that she had sewn that quilt for him herself.</p>
<p>If he hadn’t lost his memory, why would he let Wei Jiu that disgusting person, sleep on that bed with the quilt?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Su Yi Shui looked at Ranran.</p>
<p>But Ranran continued to serve food to her mother as if nothing had happened, smoothly changing the subject.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After breakfast, it was time for Xishan disciples to refine alchemy and meditate. Wei Jiu and Wen Chunhui needed quiet rest due to their recent serious depletion before they could go down Xishan to settle the score with Fantian Sect.</p>
<p>After meditating on the Ice Lotus Pond, Ranran prepared to return to the alchemy room to refine pills.</p>
<p>In this life, she seemed to have surpassed her past self in alchemy. Perhaps because she was born from wood, she naturally amplified the furnace fire, so the elixirs she refined were even more effective than Su Yi Shui’s.</p>
<p>However, during alchemy, besides the proportion of medicinal ingredients and the enhancement of the furnace fire, what mattered more was the mental influence of the alchemist.</p>
<p>One must not lose focus during alchemy. When the furnace fire stabilized without fluctuating temperatures, one could take a small break.</p>
<p>Ranran stood up and stretched lazily by the window. She happened to see someone rummaging through water buckets in the laundry room separated by a moon gate from the alchemy room.</p>
<p>Thinking of Wei Jiu being on the mountain, she couldn’t help but remain vigilant and quietly approached.</p>
<p>To her surprise, it was Su Yi Shui, who had taken off his socks and shoes, stepping on the wet quilt in a large wooden tub.</p>
<p>That quilt… wasn’t it the one Su Yi Shui asked Wei Jiu to throw away?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>She remembered that Wei Jiu, in his attempt to save trouble, had directly thrown the quilt into the mountain stream. So… did Su Yi Shui go down to the stream himself to retrieve the quilt and then bring it to the laundry room for washing?</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui had thought she was refining pills and wouldn’t have time to come to the laundry room. He didn’t expect his embarrassing act of washing the quilt to be caught by her.</p>
<p>For a moment, his face showed some stiffness and discomfort as he stood in the tub with rolled-up pant legs, unable to find a good excuse.</p>
<p>However, Ranran burst into laughter, walked over, and pushed him playfully, saying, “Who washes a quilt like this? I’ll take it to the stream and wash it with running water later…”</p>
<p>Su Yishui, with his handsome face, stiffly put on his shoes and muttered, “That guy threw the quilt onto a tree branch in the mountain stream, and now there’s two holes torn in it…”</p>
<p>Ranran squatted down to inspect it, then looked up and said, “If you still want this quilt cover, I’ll mend it and embroider bamboo patterns on it. How about that?”</p>
<p>This time, Su Yi Shui responded with an “Mm-hmm.” As Ranran was about to take the quilt and leave, he held her back, stayed silent for a moment, and then said earnestly, “I will find a way to undo the Soul-cleansing Talisman…”</p>
<p>This was the first time since Su Yi Shui’s memory loss that he expressed with such seriousness, of his desire to recover that period of missing memory.</p>
<p>Ranran’s heart was filled with indescribable bitterness and sweetness. His words implied that that period of missing memory wasn’t just cherished by her only. He also eagerly wished to recall their past together.</p>
<p>And his gesture seemed to be related to him accidentally throwing away the quilt she had hand-sewn. Ranran couldn’t help but leaned over and kissed his cheek.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui had expected this young lady to mock him, but he was surprised to see her so delighted.</p>
<p>His self-loathing for going around the mountains to pick up a quilt so early in the morning eased considerably. He even felt that his foolish act didn’t seem so silly anymore.</p>
<p>However, he maintained his tough facade: “I thought you are not willing to marry me? Why be so frivolous with me now?”</p>
<p>Seeing him trying to act tough after getting a good deal, Ranran couldn’t help but scoff and put on a fake embarrassed look, saying, “My mother said I’ve been learning skills in the mountains for so many years, and now I’m almost nineteen. If I don’t marry soon, I’ll become an old spinster. If there’s no other young man I like, I guess I can just settle for you…”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui pinched her nose, saying, “As if I would really want to marry you! You can be an old spinster for life!”</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t expect him to curse her like that, so she playfully poured the basin of water on Su Yi Shui, and they ended up laughing and playing around, but slipped on the water on the ground and ended up sitting down together.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu had just finished cultivating his qi and was about to change into clean clothes. When he entered the laundry room, he saw Xue Ranran…laughing and sitting on Su Yishui.</p>
<p><em>Damn, the variety of styles in Xishan is quite something! So this master and disciple pair usually indulged in this kind of cultivation.</em></p>
<p>Of course, Wei Jiu believed he has more appeal. If Ranran hadn’t been so confused and chose to be with him, he could come up with even more styles of play.</p>
<p>But now Wei Jiu just crossed his arms and coldly mocked, “The sect leaders of the major sects have all been replaced, and the survival of the cultivation world is in jeopardy. Yet you two are in the mood to play here? In my opinion, let’s not bother saving them, let’s just have fun together until the end!”</p>
<p>Ranran ignored Wei Jiu’s sarcastic words and instead asked him as she stood up, “Hey, you said you have a way to take us back to Red Flame Mountain, is that true?”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu raised an eyebrow coldly and said, “Of course it’s true, but… it will depend on Su Yi Shui’s abilities.”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>It turned out that Red Flame Mountain had treacherous terrain, and the Crimson Gate sect had built many secret passages over the centuries.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu, having made enemies outside in recent years, valued the safety of his old nest even more. So in addition to the long-standing secret passages, he had newly built several more.</p>
<p>He had always been ruthless in his actions and didn’t leave any craftsmen who built the tunnels alive. Therefore, there were several secret passages that only he knew about.</p>
<p>When he returned to Red Flame Mountain, he checked and found that the old secret passages had indeed been sealed. But the new one he had built was still there.</p>
<p>However, he hadn’t dared to enter it earlier when he hadn’t slept for several days. Now that he had gathered enough manpower, he could dare to venture into Red Flame Mountain.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu wasn’t really concerned about the survival of the other sects; he just wanted to reclaim Red Flame Mountain and his many years of hard work.</p>
<p>So in spite of the pleasant scenery and delicious food in Xishan, he was still quite restless and just wanted to urge Su Yi Shui and the others to lead the charge for him.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But Su Yi Shui had a cunning and sly look, staying still as if waiting for something.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu, bored out of his mind, went to the alchemy room to tease Ranran, “He has completely forgotten about you, showing that he’s not devoted to you. Don’t you want to consider me and leave yourself a way out?”</p>
<p>Ranran fanned the fire in the alchemy furnace vigorously, making sparks fly dangerously close to Wei Jiu’s face as he leaned in. She deliberately imitated Wei Jiu’s smug yet restrained expression and said with a smirk, “Consider you for what? Consider you abandoning a woman in danger and running away alone?”</p>
<p>She couldn’t forget Wei Jiu’s indifferent attitude towards Tu Jiuyuan’s survival in the Netherworld. It seemed  thatTu Jiuyuan and Wei Jiu had a complicated relationship, but it seemed like she loved an unreliable man.</p>
<p>Thinking about this incident, Wei Jiu’s face also darkened. After that trip to the Netherworld, Tu Jiuyuan had been seriously injured and took a long time to recover. Later, she repeatedly mentioned her slow recovery and wanted to go to the Southern Branch to manage things and recuperate there.</p>
<p>She wasn’t stupid; she didn’t directly say she wanted to leave the Crimson Gate, or she would have definitely been punished for violating the sect’s rules. But this act of using her injuries as an excuse was annoying.</p>
<p>What was she? Did she deserve to act so pretentiously? Didn’t she swear allegiance to the sect and offer her life to the superior when she joined the Crimson Gate?</p>
<p>But Ranran’s distraction made Wei Jiu remember the fake who impersonated him and flirted with Tu Jiuyuan.</p>
<p>At that moment, Wei Jiu somewhat understood why Su Yi Shui had asked him to throw away the quilt. A woman who had been defiled… he didn’t want her anymore!</p>
<p>Ranran initially had no intention to mock him, but Wei Jiu’s face turned sour and stinky, like he had fallen into a pickling jar, and then he angrily stood up and stormed off, swaying his black robe.</p>
<p>Ranran quietly made a mental note that the next time Wei Jiu tried to flirt, she would bring up Tu Jiuyuan to deter him from flirting in front of her.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.52shuku.vip/yanqing/am/h4Vl_260.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.52shuku.vip/yanqing/am/h4Vl_260.html</a></p>
<p>Another person as impatient as Wei Jiu was Wen Chunhui from the Kongshan Sect. She was also clueless about the current situation of her sect, so she tentatively asked Su Yi Shui when they could set off.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui’s attitude towards Wen Chunhui was still mild.</p>
<p>When Su Yi Shui was still a disciple of Jiuhua Sect, he had once gone to Kongshan Sect for a trial, and that was when he met Wen Hongshan. At that time, Wen Hongshan was also a rising star in the Kongshan Sect, constantly suppressing Wen Chunhui.</p>
<p>During their training sessions, Su Yishui could clearly feel that Wen Chunhui’s cultivation was actually more solid than Wen Hongshan’s, but she knew how to hide her strengths and never competed openly with her seniors.</p>
<p>It was only after Wen Hongshan and the sect leader passed away that Kongshan Sect found itself short of capable individuals, and Wen Chunhui reluctantly stepped up to take on major responsibilities.</p>
<p>So, facing this Abbess who was of a gentle temperament, Su Yi Shui didn’t play dumb anymore and directly said, “We’ll set off after Ranran finishes refining the last batch of pills.”</p>
<p>However, Wen Chunhui was still worried. “We need to go to Red Flame Mountain first and then to Kongshan Sect. The journey is long, and if we don’t set off soon, I’m afraid…”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui poured a cup of tea and handed it to her, saying calmly, “Who said we are going to Red Flame Mountain first? After leaving Xishan, we will immediately head for Kongshan Sect!”</p>
<p>Just as Wei Jiu wanted to use him as a spear, Su Yi Shui also wouldn’t mind using Wei Jiu as a hunting dog.</p>
<p>“But, all the mountain gates are sealed now, and Kongshan Sect doesn’t have secret passages like Crimson Gate. How do we get in?” Wen Chunhui asked, concerned.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui, however, was unworried. “Don’t worry, I have my ways.”</p>
<p>Wen Chunhui knew that Su Yi Shui was a meticulous person, so hearing his words, she felt slightly assured.</p>
<p>She wasn’t one to talk too much. Later, when Wei Jiu tried to find out when Su Yi Shui planned to depart, she simply said she didn’t know.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>However, Wen Chunhui noticed that Ranran’s pill furnace was constantly active. While others took ten months to refine pills like a pregnancy, she seemed to do it like cooking dumplings, opening and closing the furnace every few days and producing dozens of pills each time.</p>
<p>But all those beautifully shiny crafted pills ended up in the big mouth of the Gengjin White Tiger.</p>
<p>When the little white tiger consumed the pills, it was like eating seasoned beans, crunching down on those precious pills made from rare and valuable herbs.</p>
<p>The White Tiger had been seriously injured in the past, and its body had changed with its diminishing vitality. But unlike humans who could switch to pill cultivation if they failed in foundation cultivation, beasts had a slower recovery path.</p>
<p>But now, with a mistress who excelled in pill cultivation and refined pills like steaming buns, together with Wang Suizhi, the god of wealth who not only knew how to make money but also knew how to find treasures, constantly delivering various precious herbs to the mountain, Ranran’s pill furnace became even more active.</p>
<p>In just a few weeks, the white tiger’s size had continuously grown with the restoration of its vital energy, no longer able to shrink back to its former state.</p>
<p>Now it was twice the size of an ordinary tiger, and when it stood up, its white fur shimmered in the sunlight, and if it stared, it gave a sense of locking one’s soul under its gaze.</p>
<p>A spiritual beast like the White Tiger, was originally born and raised by nature. Even with intelligence, it was difficult to reach the realm of great cultivation masters.</p>
<p>But now, Xue Ranran had forcibly led her spiritual beast onto the path of pill cultivation, and it grew dozens of times faster than ordinary pill cultivators, faintly showing signs of absorbing abundant spiritual energy, nearing the realm of ascending to gods.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu was startled several times by the White Tiger who liked to jump out at him, and couldn’t help but ask Ranran, “Is this how you raise tigers in Xishan? If you keep feeding it like this, this tiger will become a divine spirit!”</p>
<p>Ranran ignored him, but privately she asked Su Yi Shui, “Do you think it’s enough already? I’m afraid that if we keep feeding it like this, *Baibai won’t be able to handle the sudden surge in spiritual power.”<br/>*白白 <em>white tiger’s name is white white hahahaha</em></p>
<p>Su Yishui approached the sunbathing white tiger. Even when lying down, it looked like a small mountain.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes, raised one hand, and the White Tiger obediently lifted one of its large white paws to meet Su Yi Shui’s palm.</p>
<p>When the palm met with the paw, countless strands of golden light seemed to intertwine between them.</p>
<p>As Su Yi Shui slowly opened his eyes, golden light flashed in both his and the White Tiger’s eyes.</p>
<p>“It’s ready.” Su Yi Shui said confidently.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>In fact, some days ago, he had already taken the White Tiger secretly to the closest sect to Xishan, the Kongshan Sect.</p>
<p>Although those spiritual shields could block people, as he had suspected, they didn’t block spiritual beasts like the White Tiger, similar to the spiritual shields of Tianmai Mountain.</p>
<p>However, when he tried to manipulate the White Tiger with talismans to enter, they were burned to ashes upon entering the spiritual shield.</p>
<p>So the only way to explore inside was to attach his spiritual power to the White Tiger’s body, just like he did when entering Tianmai Mountain.</p>
<p>But this method consumed a lot of spiritual energy. When he returned, both he and the White Tiger had suffered varying degrees of exhaustion.</p>
<p>In the face of formidable enemies on all sides, Su Yi Shui couldn’t afford such a fatal flaw in this plan. So, the only solution was to greatly increase the White Tiger’s spiritual power, so it could reach the state of unity with his level of own spiritual power.</p>
<p>Only then could he freely possess the White Tiger and come and go as he pleased.</p>
<p>Now, the White Tiger, fed by pills, had skyrocketed in spiritual power, reaching a perfect state. It was ready to set off for exploration.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until they were about to depart that Wei Jiu realized they were heading to Kongshan Sect. He was furious, shouting at Su Yi Shui for being deceitful.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui, with half lowered eyes, replied indifferently, “If Lord Wei wants to pass up nearby options for distant prospects, and insist on going to Red Flame Mountain, no one will stop you. You can go there on your own.”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu understood that he couldn’t do without Su Yi Shui now. Without his protection, he couldn’t even sleep peacefully.</p>
<p>He had nowhere else to find a more powerful ally than Su Yi Shui. For now, the only plan was to grit his teeth and follow them, finding a way to sneak into Kongshan Sect to investigate.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The founding master of Kongshan Sect was reportedly Wen Yi An, the senior sister of the great cultivator Duntian.</p>
<p>Back then, she harbored a secret love for her junior brother Duntian. Unfortunately, her love was unrequited, and Duntian ended up falling for Rong Yao, becoming a pair of cultivator companions with her.</p>
<p>Disheartened, Wen Yi An chose to establish Kongshan Sect opposite to Tianmai Mountain, where Duntian cultivated. </p>
<p>She remained unmarried throughout her life, never accepting male disciples, and all her disciples were girls who changed their surnames to Wen upon initiation.</p>
<p>That’s why all Kongshan Sect disciples were surnamed Wen, unlike other sects.</p>
<p>However, Ranran learned from Wen Chunhui during their journey, that their sect ancestor’s secular surname wasn’t Wen at all. This “Wen” was actually the secular surname of the great cultivator Duntian.</p>
<p>Ranran immediately understood. This Grandmaster Wen Yi An’s love was unrequited, so she secluded herself in Kongshan, living in a self-deceiving dream.</p>
<p>She remained unmarried, but took on her junior brother’s secular surname, never bore children of her own, yet raised a group of girls surnamed Wen.</p>
<p>Thinking harder, the peak of Kongshan faced Tianmai Mountain. Wen Yi An used to gaze from afar at Tianmai Mountain, knowing full well that her junior brother had a family and descendants. She immersed herself in fantasies of having children for him, isn’t it quite sorrowful?</p>
<p>As they arrived at the foot of Kongshan, before even getting close to the mountain, they saw a towering black tower reaching into the clouds.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu had seen a similar black tower constructed on Red Flame Mountain. Though its purpose was unknown, it inspired awe at first sight.</p>
<p>This time, Su Yishui brought along his four disciples, as well as Yuchen and Wang Suizhi.</p>
<p>Having the god of wealth with them meant they could easily find places to stay along the way, and Wang Suizhi, with his natural divination abilities, could determine if it was an auspicious day to set out.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But when they arrived at the town at the foot of Kongshan and settled in a temporary inn, Wang Suizhi stood at the inn’s door for a while, shaking his head. “No matter how I look at it, it is *ominous in all directions. There’s no sign of survival…”<br/>*四处凶门 <em>death gates in every direction</em></p>
<p>Wei Jiu, already frustrated during the journey, sneered at Wang Suizhi’s words. “Do you think you’re really a fortune-teller? Following your advice would mean the best course of action is to steer clear of this place.”</p>
<p>But Wang Suizhi replied earnestly “It’s too late there’s no life gate for a way back. Once we leave this town, there are signs of danger everywhere.”</p>
<p>His ability to discern life and death doors didn’t often manifest, he can only sense it usually only in moments of life and death crises.</p>
<p>After entering the town, Wang Suizhi hadn’t stopped breaking out in cold sweat. He sat on a chair and kept shuddering like he was ill.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu detested this display to waver morale at a critical moment, his temper befitting the Crimson Gate Sect Leader flared, and he sneered, “Since you’re so capable, can you tell if today might be your last day…”</p>
<p>As he spoke, he drew his sword and aimed straight for Wang Suizhi.</p>
<p>Wang Suizhi’s heart pounded in fear as he watched the sword approaching, unable to dodge in time.</p>
<p>Ranran casually took out a preserved fruit and used her spiritual energy to imbue it, deflecting the sword, causing it to veer off past Wang Suizhi.</p>
<p>After the scare, Wang Suizhi said, “I can’t see my own end, but I can tell I will have good fortune today, so I don’t think today will be my last day. However, if you step out of this inn today, you might encounter great misfortune!”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu didn’t expect this merchant to keep going, acting like a religious conman with his divination, and wanted to teach him a lesson.</p>
<p>But Ranran protected Wang Suizhi and coldly said, “You dare harm my disciple?”</p>
<p>While Ranran usually appeared beautiful and easy going, a very friendly lady, once she was protecting her *disciples, the fierceness of a mother wolf would burst forth from her eyes.<br/>*犊子 : 晚輩、小輩的含義 <em>juniors</em></p>
<p>Twenty years ago, it was well-known that disciples from Xishan were all lacking in skills, but they had a fierce tigress master who stood by her disciples.</p>
<p>If you provoked a disciple from Xishan, their master would really ride a tiger to settle scores with you.</p>
<p>Under Xue Ranran’s glare, Wei Jiu felt as if it was Mu Qingge who stood before him with her killing intent, so he instinctively took a step back.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Wang Suizhi, with his scruffy beard, felt very blessed hiding behind Ranran, as if he was an old chick under the wings of a mother hen, basking in the long-lost affection of his master.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui, on the other hand, glared coldly at him, ready to possess the White Tiger and tear Wei Jiu apart if he dared to harm Ranran.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu knew he was isolated and so he couldn’t be bothered with the idiotic Xishan disciples. With a snort, he walked straight out of the inn and into the streets.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Xue Ranran acknowledged Wang Suizhi’s abilities and said, “Since Wang Suizhi has divined the present dangers here, let’s trust him for now. We’ll stay in the inn for a day and decide tomorrow whether to go to Kongshan.”</p>
<p>Wen Chunhui also nodded in agreement. She had always been more easy-going and different from those who loved to show off like Elder Kaiyuan. Since she had taken refuge with Xishan, she naturally listened to the majority.</p>
<p>So, the group stayed at the inn to rest.</p>
<p>Before long, Wei Jiu returned to the inn, not alone but with a woman.</p>
<p>Ranran looked closely and realized it was Tu Jiuyuan, who should have been on Red Flame Mountain.</p>
<p>Just then, Su Yi Shui flicked his fingers, and the White Tiger lying in the courtyard stood up, growling and roaring at the two newcomers, causing the loose hair by their ears to tremble slightly.</p>
<p>Ranran stood at the door and asked, “Tu Jiuyuan? How did you end up here?”</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan glanced at Wei Jiu beside her and spoke, “After welcoming back the Excellency from before, I quickly noticed something was amiss with that person and saw many flaws. Later, I inadvertently saw the real Excellency wandering at the foot of the mountain and understood instantly. So, I seized the opportunity to escape down the mountain through a secret passage and made my way here, finally meeting up with the Excellency now.”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu spoke up at this moment, “She knows a lot of hidden information, let her come in and explain slowly…”</p>
<p>As he spoke, the two of them started walking towards the house.</p>
<p>Ranran, following Su Yi Shui’s gaze without changing her expression, looked towards the courtyard at the sun’s corona, and said with a cold smile, “Lord Wei Jiu, weren’t you very imposing just now, saying you wouldn’t come back?”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu sneered, “When did I say that? Don’t try to test me.”</p>
<p>With that, he started walking towards the courtyard. At that moment, the sun was at its zenith. The White Tiger stepped back slightly, allowing the sunlight to pour into the courtyard.</p>
<p>Ranran lowered her head and looked closely. There was no shadow under the feet of the two standing at the courtyard gate.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">如鱼得水   LIKE A FISH IN WATER</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Wei Jiu and Tu Jiuyuan actually had no shadows!</p>
<p>The two people seemed to notice Ranran’s gaze and slowly lowered their heads, looking at their own feet. Then, they each revealed a sinister smile.</p>
<p>These two in front of them… were clearly two fakes split off from the Nine-Headed Monster Python!</p>
<p>At that moment, Su Yi Shui waved his hand slightly, and the White Tiger sensed Su Yi Shui’s killing intent, roaring angrily and pounced towards the two. The two also fought back.</p>
<p>These fakes fully inherited the power of their originals, even showing some improvements. If it were the previous White Tiger, it probably wouldn’t have been their match.</p>
<p>But now, under the boost of Ranran’s pill cultivation, the White Tiger’s spiritual energy surged. It usually ran wild all over Xishan, enjoying its freedom. These past few days, it was feeling very uncomfortable being cooped up in the inns while they traveled, unable to release its pent-up energy, and its wild nature was about to erupt.</p>
<p>Right now, it was like a big cat finding mice to tease, suddenly finding something fun.</p>
<p>After just a few rounds, the two fakes were scratched and bruised all over.</p>
<p>But they seemed to be impervious to pain. Even when their legs were scratched to the bone, their offense was unrelenting.</p>
<p>Seeing that they couldn’t get into the inn, the two exchanged a glance. Tu Jiuyuan suddenly threw two small porcelain bottles towards the house.</p>
<p>Ranran was already on guard against them. When she saw the bottles being thrown, she casually waved and knocked the cushions off the chair to wrap around the bottles. Su Yi Shui quickly took them, using his spiritual energy to tightly wrap the cushions around the bottles.</p>
<p>At that moment, Tu Jiuyuan rolled her eyes until only the whites are seen, and said with a sinister tone “Go back, what is happening here has nothing to do with you…” Before she could finish, the White Tiger tore off one of her arms. In an instant, Tu Jiuyuan looked like her soul was sucked out, collapsing and lying motionless on the ground, her skin taking on a deathly pallor.</p>
<p>As for the fake Wei Jiu, he quickly turned and fled.</p>
<p>When they chased out of the inn, Wei Jiu had already disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui then peeled off the cushions and took out the two white porcelain bottles.</p>
<p>The bottles were thin and translucent. If Ranran hadn’t caught them with the cushion, they would have probably shattered on the ground.</p>
<p>Through the bottles, one could vaguely see something wriggling inside. Su Yishui took them and focused, slowly saying, “These aren’t deadly items, but rather poisonous worms that make people fall into a deep sleep.”</p>
<p>After the inn was booked by Su Yishui, he had secured it with a spiritual shield and even the original staff of the inn couldn’t enter. </p>
<p>Today, they have not gone out at all, so the followers from Fantian Sect who were spying on them, couldn’t hold themselves back and sent these two fakes to infiltrate the inn after Wei Jiu left. They were hoping to pour the poisonous worms from the bottles into their soups when they were unawares, knocking them out.</p>
<p>Ranran had originally thought the bottles would contain something like giant python venom, but it turned out to be poisonous worms that caused sleepiness. The extremely sinister Fantian Sect seemed unusually gentle towards Xishan people.</p>
<p>No wonder Wei Jiu had always tried to inquire if there were any old connections between Xishan and Fantian Sect, perhaps through marriages or something. Otherwise, why would Fantian Sect “favor” Xishan so much?</p>
<p>Although they now understood that the Fantian Sect seemed to want to capture the people of Xishan alive, their intentions still remained unclear.</p>
<p>Wen Chunhui still had lingering fear and asked, “Is Wei Jiu… dead?”</p>
<p>She remembered Wang Suizhi’s statement in the morning, and after Wei Jiu had left and a fake appeared, his original self was likely in grave danger.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Just then, there was another sound at the door.</p>
<p>It turned out Wei Jiu had returned after he fled!</p>
<p>Gao Cang couldn’t help but curse, “Damn it, isn’t this enough? Why do we have to go through this again? Are they going to let us have lunch?”</p>
<p>The White Tiger let out another roar and pounced towards Wei Jiu again.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu hastily defended himself, cursing loudly, “What’s wrong with this beast? Why is it suddenly biting people?”</p>
<p>Just then, his gaze fell on the torn body of Tu Jiuyuan on the ground. He was stunned, and before he could react, the White Tiger bit his arm, causing him to scream in pain.</p>
<p>Ranran noticed that he could feel pain unlike those fakes created from the python, so she quickly stopped the White Tiger and then looked at Wei Jiu.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu didn’t care about the blood pouring from his arm. He just looked at Tu Jiuyuan’s corpse, his face darkening as he asked “Which of you killed her?”</p>
<p>It was already past noon, so shadow tracking wouldn’t work. After Ranran briefly explained what had happened, she said, “She should not be the real Tu Jiuyuan, but a fake created by the snake venom… Where did you go just now?”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu frowned and said, “I just went for a walk in town. This town is too remote. There are hardly any shops around. I wanted to eat outside, but the table at the restaurant was filthy, which killed my appetite, so I came back.”</p>
<p>He squatted down and stared at Tu Jiuyuan. Her face, which had accompanied him for years, now looked ashen, her eyes hollow and wide open.</p>
<p>Since the fake had infiltrated Red Flame Mountain, there was nothing surprising about this Tu Jiuyuan also affected by the snake venom replication. The real Tu Jiuyuan was probably killed long ago.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Wei Jiu suddenly felt very annoyed and was about to walk into the inn.</p>
<p>But Ranran stopped him politely, saying, “It’s past noon now, and we can’t confirm your true identity yet. So you can’t enter this inn right now. Come back after midnight when we can verify your identity… Please have a walk outside for now, Lord Wei.”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui gave a wave of his hand, and the inn’s spiritual shield repelled Wei Jiu out forcefully.</p>
<p>The force was so strong that Wei Jiu’s money pouch which was hanging at his waist came off and landed squarely into Wang Suizhi’s arms.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier was dumbfounded, “Uncle Master Wang, you really have wealth luck today. Without even stepping out, you’ve made a small fortune! This is so impressive!”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Wei Jiu, who was forced out, couldn’t stabilize himself and fell sitting on the ground. He felt something sticky under him and when he looked down, he realized he had sat on dog excrement.</p>
<p>Even the hand he landed on was also full of it!</p>
<p>Wei Jiu jumped up in anger, cursing Su Yi Shui for being unscrupulous and demanded to go inside the inn to bathe and change his clothes. Unfortunately, the inn’s gate remained tightly closed, and until the right time, he wouldn’t be allowed in.</p>
<p>At this moment, Wei Jiu recalled the words of the old charlatan Wang Suizhi—”<em>If you step out of this inn today, you might encounter great misfortune.</em>“</p>
<p>Now it seemed that the old conman’s words had all come true, which was quite eerie.</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon, there was a heavy rainstorm. Wei Jiu took off his coat, threw it on the street, and walked a few steps, only to get soaked immediately. Although he managed to block the rain with a spiritual shield, his clothes were still drenched, and his bad luck was confirmed.</p>
<p>Standing under the eaves, Wei Jiu looked at the distant black tower on Kongshan with a gloomy expression. Yet in his heart, he couldn’t help but wonder if his loyal subordinate Tu Jiuyuan was really gone?</p>
<p>When midnight arrived, and his true identity was verified under the lamp’s light, Wei Jiu entered the inn wearing thin innerwear, his lustrous hair all disheveled, drastically diminishing the beauty of a demon lord of this generation. He exuded a strong killing intent, almost ready to slay immortals.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The next day, at the breakfast table, Qiu Xier couldn’t wait to ask Uncle master Wang if there were any auspicious signs today.</p>
<p>However, Wang Suizhi frowned and looked for a while before shaking his head with regret, “Yesterday’s attack was too severe. It still hurts at the back of my head, and I see black spots everywhere. You might have to rely on your own luck.”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran nodded and looked at her old disciple with some concern, saying, “You should rest well in the inn today. I’ve prepared some pills suitable for you to replenish your energy.”</p>
<p>Since the two fakes showed up yesterday, it meant their whereabouts were exposed. There was no need to hide anymore, especially since it was bright and suitable for a venture out to the sect’s gate today.</p>
<p>After breakfast, Wang Suizhi and Qiu Xier, the two least combat-capable, stayed behind to guard their ‘home’. The inn’s spiritual shield remained active, so they should be safe inside.</p>
<p>As for the rest, including Wei Jiu and Wen Chunhui, they set off together towards Kongshan.</p>
<p>The warnings Wang Suizhi gave yesterday about dangers everywhere and not going out had been validated. As they left the town, they found that the closer they got to Kongshan, the more the trees and roads were covered in a layer of dark brown mud. It seemed that a torrential black mud rain had fallen near Kongshan yesterday.</p>
<p>Ranran even noticed that the brown-black mud seemed to have a strong acidic smell, corroding and breaking many weak saplings along the way.</p>
<p>They also encountered sporadic travelers who had been burned while traveling at night, lying in agony in the black mud, calling for help.</p>
<p>Ranran quickly cleared a piece of land with her spiritual energy and moved the injured they met along the way to this open space. According to them, it started raining normally yesterday, but at night, a black rain fell, burning them. They had initially sought shelter in a cave, but the black mud started flooding in, forcing them to run out.</p>
<p>Even after the rain had stopped, thunder was still rumbling overhead over at Kongshan.</p>
<p>Seeing this situation, Wen Chunhui’s face changed. She had been cultivating diligently for decades and had seen some battles. This scene… why did it seem so much like the Heavenly Calamity<em> </em>her master once described?</p>
<p>It was said that if someone dared to defy the laws of heaven and earth, causing chaos with the Yin and Yang, the anger of the heavenly gods would bring forth natural disasters. First, a torrential black rain would fall, followed by thunderous calamities. At that time, within a hundred miles, there would be no safe place, and even the villages around Kongshan might be affected.</p>
<p>“How… could such signs appear?”</p>
<p>Ranran looked at the black spiritual tower whose construction seemed to be still progressing, and murmured, “Perhaps that unwelcome black tower has attracted the calamity…”</p>
<p>Everyone looked closely and indeed, most of the thunder was concentrated at the top of the tower, as if trying to shatter it. However, something seemed to be shrouding the sky above Kongshan, causing the black rain and thunder to be deflected and scattered around the surroundings of Kongshan.</p>
<p>They traveled swiftly on the wind and finally reached the base of Kongshan. The lightning and thunder were more intense, making it difficult to get closer.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Just then, amidst the thunder and lightning, Ranran vaguely saw several figures hovering in mid-air, looking towards the direction of Kongshan.</p>
<p>At that moment, one of them turned around and glanced at them. Ranran immediately recognized that person… wasn’t it the Medicine Immortal!</p>
<p>The last time she saw him was during the Qi Xi Festival. He had appeared as an ordinary clothed commoner, standing by the riverbank steps, resembling a grieving handsome scholar mourning his deceased wife.</p>
<p>But now, the Medicine Immortal wore a vermilion-colored robe, with a touch of vermilion on his brows, emitting a faint golden light, looking like an immortal. It made people recall the vast difference between him and his brother. He had already ascended to the ranks of immortality.</p>
<p>Seeing the group from Xishan, the Medicine Immortal left his companions and landed gracefully in front of them. “You’ve also come.”</p>
<p>Ranran respectfully said, “May I ask, esteemed immortal, what exactly has happened on Kongshan? How did it attract such a calamity?”</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal’s face carried a chilling aura as he replied in a low voice, “Do you know what the tower on that mountain is built of?”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu furrowed his brows and replied, “Isn’t it made of black stones?”</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal smiled wryly and shook his head, “If it were stones, how could it attract calamities? Those charred things… are the burnt bones of powerful cultivators who attempted to ascend through tribulations…”</p>
<p>Whether they succeeded in ascension or not, their bodies would be abandoned during the heavenly tribulations of ascension. These powerful cultivators had indestructible bodies, and unless turned into powder, their bones would remain abnormally hard.</p>
<p>No wonder the Fantian Sect had been scheming to replace all the leaders of the three major sects. Only by completely controlling these sects can they freely dig up the graves of these sects’ ancestors for hundreds of years and excavate the skeletons of those powerful cultivators.</p>
<p>Being able to build such high towers, and not just one, means they have also excavated skeletons from unknown mountain peaks…But why would they do such a thing?</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui suddenly spoke up, “Is the Fantian Sect planning to build the Tower of Reversal?”</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal nodded with a heavy expression. Ranran widened her eyes, not understanding the purpose of this Tower of Reversal.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu, however, had heard something about it and, while shocked, he narrowed his eyes as he spoke, “As the saying goes, even immortals cannot redo their past mistakes. Once certain things happened, they are difficult to change. But there is a way to go against the heavens. It’s said that the Tower of Reversal can reverse time, changing things that have already happened… Such a ‘regret medicine’, actually exists…”</p>
<p>Now everyone looked at each other in surprise. Ranran hadn’t expected that the Fantian Sect’s plan was something that went against the heavens to this extent.</p>
<p>When she had went against the heavens and changed the fate chart of the secular emperor, she had almost ended up with a scattered soul. Yet the Fantian Sect was even bolder, wanting to change things that had already happened and go back in time.</p>
<p>What kind of regret did this demonic sect want to change?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Building such sinister towers obviously didn’t sit well with the heavens. Once the tall towers were completed, connecting heaven and earth, it would likely not only cause great changes in the human realm but also turmoil in the heavenly realm.</p>
<p>No wonder the Heavenly Emperor had sent several immortals to observe, ensuring that the Towers of Reversal would be destroyed.</p>
<p>At this moment, there was a momentary flash of light in the sky, and a thunderbolt snaked down from above like a light sword, striking towards the black tower with a crack, only to be blocked by an invisible light shield outside Kongshan.</p>
<p>After this lightning strike, countless thunderbolts descended one after another, as if connecting the sky and earth together. Ranran and the others were stunned by this scene resembling the end of the world, and even the immortals who accompanied the Medicine Immortal fell silent.</p>
<p>Although they were immortals, they had only recently ascended and were still lower-ranked immortals, so such a scene was not something they encountered frequently.</p>
<p>The thunderbolts continuously struck the light shield, spreading a layer of lightning on it. However, this light shield was formed in a mysterious way. Although it swayed constantly from the strikes, it held firm and didn’t break.</p>
<p>After half an hour, the thunderbolts gradually subsided, and the light shield fluctuated for a moment before slowly stabilizing.<br/>*半柱香 <em>:half an incense stick of time</em></p>
<p>Ranran and Wei Jiu watched in stupefaction, and even the immortals accompanying the Medicine Immortal took a sharp breath. They hadn’t expected that not even the Heavenly calamity could break through this light shield. This mission seemed to be in jeopardy, and they were at a loss, unable to come up with any plans.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Su Yi Shui had been focused on watching the thunder strikes on Kongshan, seeming to discover something. He said, “Let me try…”</p>
<p>Finishing his sentence, he leaped into action during a break in the thunder and lightning, arriving at the foot of Kongshan. He pulled out some silver needles and looked up at the thunder and lightning in the sky.</p>
<p>He had noticed clearly that every time the Heavenly calamity passed, there was a momentary weakness in this invisible shield, followed by a strengthening, preparing for the next wrathful thunderbolt.</p>
<p>So he wanted to coordinate with the Heavenly Calamity, looking for this momentary weakness.</p>
<p>However, by doing so, he also placed himself in great danger amidst the thunder and heavenly calamity strikes.</p>
<p>Ranran watched him agilely avoid the lightning, feeling her heart pounding.</p>
<p>She mounted her White Tiger and also entered the thunderstorm, wielding her mechanical staff to help Su Yi Shui divert the lightning.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui, with a stern face, shouted at Ranran, “Who told you to come in? Get out quickly!”</p>
<p>Those charred bones used to build the tower had experienced the power of the Heavenly calamity.</p>
<p>And this Heavenly calamity was probably too much even for the heavenly immortals. Ranran’s reckless entry here, if struck, would likely result in instant death.</p>
<p>But Ranran urgently said, “Don’t waste time and delay things, hurry!”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui glared at her fiercely but knew she was right. Now that she was amidst the Heavenly calamity, it would be too late even if she tried to leave.</p>
<p>Thinking this, he took out a silver needle used for acupuncture in each hand and, as the lightning struck intermittently, continuously shot them at the light shield, while he moved quickly all around, testing for weaknesses in the light shield.</p>
<p>As he suspected, this invisible shield was not unbreakable all the time.</p>
<p>When it was strong, the silver needles turned into green smoke upon contact. But when it weakened, the silver needles turned into powder.</p>
<p>After testing for a while, Su Yi Shui stopped moving around, standing still in one place. He reached out and pulled out a large number of silver needles, continuously throwing them at the light shield, all hitting the same spot. At this moment, the Heavenly calamity’s thunderbolts was drawn to the needles hitting the light shield, and struck at the same spot repeatedly. Over time, the light shield at that spot began to dent.</p>
<p>Observing from outside the calamity zone, the Medicine immortal’s eyes lit up. He said, “Impressive technique. Although the thunderbolt is mighty, it is randomly scattered in its attack. The silver needles may seem weak, but due to the concentrated spiritual energy at the needle tip, their force is quite significant.”</p>
<p>He realized that Su Yi Shui’s technique was quite unique, with each silver needle striking continuously at a specific rhythm in the same spot.</p>
<p>Before the light shield recovered from the last strike of the silver needle’s spiritual energy, it was struck by the next one. With the continuous strikes of the silver needles, the previous force not yet dissipated and new force was added, gradually damaging the light shield accumulated over time, making it possible to break through.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui’s silver needles gradually decreased, but the number of lightning strikes directed at the light shield increased.</p>
<p>The invisible shield dented more and more severely, finally cracking under a series of thunderbolt strikes.</p>
<p>In a split second, Su Yi Shui, Ranran, and the White Tiger swiftly dashed inside. But the light shield quickly returned to its original state, with no trace of the crack.</p>
<p>At this moment, several robed immortals hovering in mid-air with worried expressions turned to the Medicine Immortal and said, “Those who entered are just ordinary mortals, plus a hairy beast. I’m afraid they won’t succeed, right?”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Wei Jiu, who had been watching from the sidelines, heard the words of these immortals and couldn’t help but snort coldly, sarcastically saying, “You all have immortal bones and divine muscles, yet you are afraid of getting struck by lightning and unwilling to take risks. So those who entered are mere ordinary mortals, not a single immortal…”</p>
<p>After hearing such sarcasm, the Medicine Immortal just smiled wryly.</p>
<p>Ascension to immortality is not easy, and those who have gone through it know *the terror of Heavenly tribulations, let alone the Heavenly Calamity that can destroy immortal bodies?<br/>*天劫 <em>tribulations</em> 天谴 <em>calamity</em></p>
<p>So just now, it was evident that the few immortals were cherishing their lives and not easily risking themselves to help.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu spoke the truth, and the Medicine Immortal wasn’t angered. However, an elderly white-haired immortal obviously couldn’t tolerate this. With a cold snort, he waved the whisk in his hand, and Wei Jiu suddenly flew up into the air, doing a somersault before crashing into the black mud below.</p>
<p>When he tried to get up, he felt like his body was being crushed by a millstone, unable to rise no matter how hard he tried. His head was pressed into the black mud several times, he looked extremely miserable.</p>
<p>Although a demonic cultivator of a generation like him could fight Su Yi Shui for hundreds of rounds, before true ascended immortals, they were like ants, easily crushed with a flick of a finger.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu’s fall was extremely pathetic, especially his neck and face, and he instantly screamed in agony from the corrosive black mud.</p>
<p>When the immortal stopped, he angrily stood up, looking at the several immortals hovering above, gnashing his teeth loudly with resentment.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder everyone wants to become immortal. This feeling of being above all beings is more satisfying than being an emperor. One day, he too would stand in the clouds and crush these people who dared to belittle him into powder… whether they were mortal or immortal!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Moving from Wei Jiu and his silent vow of revenge, the two who had entered Kongshan rode their White Tiger all the way up and soon reached the halfway point of the mountain.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui had visited Kongshan often in his youth, so he was very familiar with the terrain here.</p>
<p>When they intruded, it seemed that the followers of the Fantian Sect in Kongshan had sensed something and started searching everywhere.</p>
<p>Just as Su Yi Shui and Ranran hid in a cave on a cliff, a familiar voice sounded above them, “There seemed to be a disturbance in the shield just now. Quick, search carefully, and don’t let anyone in!”</p>
<p>Ranran and Su Yi Shui glanced at each other. They both recognized the voice as Mu Ranwu.</p>
<p>They did not expect to find Mu Ranwu also in Kongshan. She seemed to be fitting in well in the Fantian Sect like a fish in water, what kind of benefits had she been given by the mysterious leader.</p>
<p>But since she was here too, it would seem that the following things could be easier.</p>
<p>When Su Yi Shui glanced at Ranran, Ranran immediately understood.</p>
<p>Although this sister from his previous life was a malicious person, but if they could capture her and attach a Truth Talisman to her, she would surely spill many important truths to them.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">曾经为神   ONCE A GOD</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>With a plan in place, the two of them set about finding the right moment.</p>
<p>Those expressionless disciples of the Fantian Sect seemed to be empowered by a mysterious force. If they all came rushing in at once, it would be difficult to handle. So, they had to seize the opportune moment to grab her carefully.</p>
<p>In Ranran’s little waist pouch, was stuffed full with the new talismans made by Elder Jiu.</p>
<p>When he was abducted and ended up in Wei Jiu’s hands, although he had suffered some torment, it also had a benefit — his skill in drawing talismans had greatly advanced.</p>
<p>In addition, now that Elder Jiu knew his little friend Ranran was his old friend Mu Qingge, naturally, he generously gave her many top-notch talismans as a gift.</p>
<p>So, after the two of them and the White Tiger applied the invisibility talismans, suppressed their true qi, and adjusted their aura, they went up the cliff. After they emerged, they looked around and found that there weren’t many disciples of the Fantian Sect around. Most of them were gathered at the mountaintop, still constructing the Heavenly-Defying Tower.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Mu Ranwu seemed to have gone to the mountaintop as well, so they followed her and arrived at the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>When they approached the black bone tower, both Su Yi Shui and Ranran both felt a chilling aura.</p>
<p>Even the Gengjin White tiger, felt uncomfortable, and the fur on its neck bristled.</p>
<p>Ranran comforted the tiger by stroking its fur and then looked at Mu Ranwu standing below the tower.</p>
<p>Due to the scars on her face, Mu Ranwu always covered her face with a light veil. When she looked at the bone tower, she would occasionally touch her face with her hand.</p>
<p>Ranran felt that perhaps this sister from her previous life wanted to turn back time to restore her appearance before it was ruined?</p>
<p>Just as Mu Ranwu turned around to prepare to go down the mountain and check on the intruders, she suddenly felt a gust of wind attacking her.</p>
<p>With a start, Mu Ranwu wanted to shout out, but her acupoints were sealed, and she couldn’t move at all. Then she was quickly lifted and brought to a cave below the cliff.</p>
<p>When Ranran and Su Yi Shui dispelled the invisibility talisman to reveal themselves, Mu Ranwu didn’t panic. She just chuckled coldly twice, “So it’s you two who had intruded. I already guessed you were up to no good…”</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t want to waste words with her and immediately slapped a Truth-telling Talisman on Mu Ranwu’s forehead. “Let me ask you, what does the Fantian Sect want to achieve by building this black tower?”</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu didn’t show any struggle on her face. It seemed that even without the talisman, she was also willing to answer this question. “What? Can’t you already figure this out? The existence of this Heaven-Defying Tower is to defy fate, reverse time, and resolve the regrets of life!”</p>
<p>Ranran frowned. “Such an insane idea. Wouldn’t this cause chaos in the Three Realms?”</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu laughed loudly after hearing this. “What’s wrong with chaos? This world is originally unfair in many ways. For those unfairly treated by heaven, don’t they need a chance to start over? Sister, guess what I would do if I could start over from scratch?”</p>
<p>Ranran said coldly, “Whose idea is this? Who is the mastermind behind the Fantian Sect?”</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu smiled and said, “He is a being beyond gods, the only saint in this world. As long as you follow him, you can obtain true immortality! How about it, sister? Why don’t you consider joining the Fantian Sect?”</p>
<p>But when Ranran pressed further about the identity of that person, Mu Ranwu couldn’t explain clearly. It seemed she truly didn’t know the person’s name and background. She only said that the person always wore a mask and was the one who single-handedly revived the Fantian Sect, which had already disappeared from the world.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui looked at Mu Ranwu’s arrogant demeanor and said coldly, “It seems like you’re not at all worried about your current situation.”</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu laughed, “Since time is about to reverse, both you and I will live one more time. So, is the present moment still important? Su Yi Shui, don’t you also have many regrets? My elder sister acted on her own back then, changing your fate as an emperor. You were supposed to be the emperor of a generation, enjoying honors that countless people would envy, and few would exchange for immortalty. As long as you are willing to follow the Fantian god, you can also return to the past with your memories intact and make up for various regrets!”</p>
<p>As she spoke, Mu Ranwu’s eyes were fervent, and her words were quite enticing. Xue Ranran couldn’t help but look at Su Yi Shui, worried that he might be swayed by this madwoman.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>However, Su Yi Shui replied coldly, “Only the incompetent would hope for time reversal. I have always moved forward and never looked back.”</p>
<p>This was not meant to mock Mu Ranwu but was his sincere words, even though he had forgotten his past with Mu Qingge due to the Soul-Cleansing Talisman.</p>
<p>Despite the hardships along the way, he seemed to have lost many things he originally wanted but gained many unexpected ones.</p>
<p>Therefore, Su Yi Shui only wanted to move forward and didn’t want to change any single thing about the present through time reversal.</p>
<p>Hearing Su Yi Shui’s words, Mu Ranwu sighed regretfully, “Stubborn as ever! But you didn’t expect that since you’ve come to Kongshan, you won’t be able to leave, right? The bones needed to build the Spiritual Tower are missing a few pieces, so since you’re here, leave behind your bones as construction materials for the tower!”</p>
<p>Before she finished speaking, Mu Ranwu suddenly broke free from the previous restraint, swung her sword towards Su Yi Shui’s face.</p>
<p>In just over a month of not seeing each other, Mu Ranwu’s strength seemed to have improved significantly. When she wielded her sword, her previous techniques from Xishan were no longer recognizable. It seemed she had learned new sword skills, each move precise and vicious, and the spiritual power she emitted carried a strange aura.</p>
<p>It looked very similar to the techniques of those expressionless Fantian Sect members.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran also stepped forward, and the two of them clashed with Mu Ranwu.</p>
<p>After they engaged, Xue Ranran was also greatly surprised because Mu Ranwu had become much stronger than before, almost like a different person.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu also noticed this and couldn’t help but laugh aloud, “I have already sacrificed all my spiritual energy to the Fantian Master, in exchange for supreme power bestowed by the Master. Sister, do you always think that I should be grateful to you for ‘bestowing’ everything on me? Including inheriting your spiritual power? Well, now everything I have on me has nothing to do with you!”</p>
<p>She said this with a smug look. Did these two still see her as that inept underling, a nobody? Did they really think she was only here because of her lack of skills?</p>
<p>She wanted to catch them off guard and shatter the arrogance on the faces of these two cultivation geniuses, make them regret for not taking her seriously!</p>
<p>Thinking like this, Mu Ranwu became even more ruthless in her moves.</p>
<p>The only requirement to officially join the Fantian Sect was to sacrifice one’s cultivation and receive a new life. So Mu Ranwu had been hesitant.</p>
<p>But after the incident in Qiongqi Village, where she was humiliated, and her self-esteem crushed, she no longer hesitated. She finally gritted her teeth and sacrificed her spiritual power.</p>
<p>The Fantian Master indeed did not deceive her. Although she lost her spiritual energy, what she gained was ten times more powerful than before.</p>
<p>Now, she could easily fight against these two, feeling no strain at all. This feeling of turning the tables was indescribably exhilarating.</p>
<p>For a moment, she accelerated her sword strikes against the two, and the spiritual power she wielded became stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>Although this game of cat and mouse was enjoyable, what she wanted to see the most was her sword piercing through the bodies of these two!</p>
<p>Just then, a huge tiger leaped out unexpectedly, almost biting Mu Ranwu’s arm.</p>
<p>Startled, Mu Ranwu took a step back, finally realizing that the giant tiger was the Gengjin white tiger.</p>
<p>However, its current size was even larger than twenty years ago before it was injured. Its eyes gleamed with a cold golden light, as if it was about to ascend to immortality.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu was quite frightened by the sudden appearance of the white tiger. She had feared this white tiger even twenty years ago, and now that it had grown even larger, it made her panic in spite of herself.</p>
<p>In her retreating steps, she accidentally stepped into thin air and fell off the cliff. As she fell, she realized that even if the white tiger was larger, with her current abilities, she could easily twist off its head.</p>
<p>The abilities gained so effortlessly sometimes made it hard for her to remember they were her own. By the time Mu Ranwu snapped out of her reverie, she had missed her chance.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When she turned herself around and jumped back onto the cliff, those two and the tiger seemed to have applied invisibility talismans again and disappeared.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu gnashed her teeth in frustration, but the Heaven-Defying Tower would soon be completed. Once the four towers were built and connected, the reversal of fate was imminent!</p>
<p>By then, she would want to go back to before she came to Xishan.</p>
<p>She remembered that Mu Qingge had thought about sending her, a young and frail girl, to be fostered by a farming family while she herself planned to sell herself to a wealthy household as a maidservant to support her. She had cried and refused to separate from her sister, and it just so happened that they encountered their master from Xishan, who then took them in as disciples.</p>
<p>*If she could go back to that time, she would absolutely not cry and let her sister become a maidservant while she would quietly wait for their master from Xishan to pass by.</p>
<p>This time, she would go up the mountain alone, learn cultivation, undergo trials at Tianmai Mountain, follow the path her sister had taken, become famous, and achieve greatness as a powerful cultivator.</p>
<p>If that happened, she would wholeheartedly redeem her sister, find a decent man for her to marry, let her live a good life in the mundane world. By then, she could peacefully watch her sister serve her husband, have children, gradually grow old, and die peacefully.</p>
<p>Perhaps then, she and her sister could get along peacefully, and she wouldn’t feel indebted to her sister anymore.</p>
<p>Hadn’t her sister also tactfully advised her that if she couldn’t bear the hardships of cultivation, she could go down the mountain and get married? Since marriage seemed so good, she could fulfill her sister’s wish in this lifetime.</p>
<p>By then, she could thoroughly repair the irreparable sisterly bond and proudly accept the admiration of others.</p>
<p>With such thoughts in mind, Mu Ranwu took a deep breath and turned back to the mountaintop, directing people to continue construction of the tall bone tower.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, Xue Ranran and Su Yi Shui had already arrived at the back mountain of Kongshan. This place was the forbidden area of Kongshan Sect, rumored to be the place where the founding ancestor of the sect had passed into Nirvana. The mortal bodies of the sect’s past leaders and elders were also buried here.</p>
<p>As the burial place for Kongshan Sect’s elders, this area was deep in the woods, with gurgling streams and breathtaking scenery. However, what Xue Ranran and Su Yi Shui saw when they arrived was toppled gravestones and ruined graves everywhere.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran felt a pang of sadness, and Su Yi Shui also frowned. They walked forward, and the ground was littered with open graves. It seemed that the black bone tower on the mountaintop had used a lot of materials from here.</p>
<p>However, the further they went, the fewer graves there were, and the more dignified the remains in those graves seemed to be.</p>
<p>At the center of the back mountain, there was only one large grave covering several acres of land. The tombstone read “Tomb of Kongshan Sect’s Founding Ancestor, Wen Yi An.”</p>
<p>Ranran remembered the stories about the sect that Wen Chunhui had told her on the way here and immediately understood that the person buried here was the founding ancestor of Kongshan Sect, Wen Yi An.</p>
<p>Her cultivation back then was not beneath that of the great cultivator Duntian, but in the end, instead of ascending, she chose to pass away and was buried in eternal sleep on this slope facing Tianmai Mountain.</p>
<p>Instead of going to Duntian’s side after ascending, she chose to give up and silently watch over the abandoned Tianmai Mountain from afar, maintaining a quiet vigil…</p>
<p>Ranran felt that this Elder Wen Yi An was a very special woman.</p>
<p>The contrast between this tomb and the chaotic graves around it was striking. Surprisingly, this tomb of the founding ancestor was intact and had not been disturbed.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran exclaimed softly and exchanged a glance with Su Yi Shui before hurrying to the tombstone.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran looked around again and whispered, “It’s strange. Almost all the graves of Kongshan Sect have been dug up, so why is the tomb of the founding ancestor left untouched? Could it be that her remains are not suitable for building the tower?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui also raised an eyebrow slightly, and the two of them speculated for a while. Could it really be that the founding ancestor lacked enough cultivation, or maybe she didn’t pass away here on the back mountain but elsewhere, and this tomb doesn’t contain her remains?</p>
<p>Just then, Su Yi Shui suddenly listened intently for a moment, then pointed to a distance and gestured to Xue Ranran to stay quiet. They both used techniques to conceal their spiritual energy, making sure none leaked out.</p>
<p>They had kept the invisibility talismans on them, so unless someone knew beforehand, they wouldn’t be able to detect them even if they were right in front of them, immortals included.</p>
<p>After a moment, footsteps approached, and a figure wearing black clothes, tall and slender with a mask on his face, walked over. His movements were slow and graceful, almost as if he floated along like the wind. *<em>lol if he was so graceful why were there footsteps…</em></p>
<p>He carried a large basket and seemed to be here to tend to the graves. When he reached Wen Yi An’s tomb, he bent down, plucked the grass covering the tomb one by one, then took out a bowl containing meat buns and a bunch of rare golden chrysanthemums out of this season from the basket.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui stared at the newcomer, his muscles slightly tensed.</p>
<p>At this point, Xue Ranran had a faint guess about this person, likely the Fantian Sect’s Master that Mu Ranwu had mentioned.</p>
<p>Since he wore a mask, his face couldn’t be seen clearly, but he came to tend to the grave of the Kongshan Sect’s deceased ancestor.</p>
<p>It was unlikely that he came here out of guilt for taking over their mountain. He must have some connection with Kongshan Sect, to come pay respects to the deceased.</p>
<p>At that moment, the person wiped the dust off the tombstone with his sleeve while speaking ‘Since the two of you have come here, why not reveal yourselves and speak? I am temporarily the owner of this mountain. Naturally, I will treat you as guests.’</p>
<p>After saying that, the person casually flicked two blades of grass with his fingers. The originally soft grass shot straight towards the two figures hidden in the distance, hitting the invisibility charms on their chests precisely, causing them to lose their invisibility.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Since they were now revealed, Su Yi Shui and Xue Ranran boldly approached.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran sniffed the faint herbal scent in the air and suddenly clasped her hands courteously, ‘Thank you, Senior, for guiding and assisting me several times.’</p>
<p>Her sense of smell was sharp. She immediately recognized the scent from the fake Medicine immortal she met at Tianmai Mountain.</p>
<p>Later, she encountered the old shepherd by the flower sea and the elder who gave her grass shoes at the foot of Red Flame Mountain, both carried the same scent.</p>
<p>Therefore, she was certain that she had met this masked person at least three times.</p>
<p>The person didn’t seem surprised that Ranran recognized him. He simply said, “You’re quite clever to recognize me.”</p>
<p>Ranran replied, “The herbal scent on you is very distinctive and unforgettable.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the smell of herbs but a mixture of bitterness and sweetness with an indescribable sense of decay, making it memorable to Ranran.</p>
<p>The person said in a low voice, “I once traveled to the lowest level of the Netherworld, carrying the stench of decay from there. I can only cover it up with the scent of herbs…”</p>
<p>Ranran, sensing no hostility from him, tried to probe further, “May I ask if you are the Master of the Fantian Sect?”</p>
<p>The person stood up from in front of the tomb, looked towards the distant silhouette of Tianmai Mountain, and said mildly, “I just exchanged some things with a group of greedy individuals. They come and go freely, and I am not some grand master of a sect. Everyone will take what they need, and we part ways when we’ve benefited enough.”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui, who had been observing him, spoke coldly, “So may I ask, why do you command those people to attack various sects, collect the bones of powerful cultivators to build these bone towers? What is your purpose?”</p>
<p>The man continued in a distant tone “The name ‘Heaven-Defying Tower’ itself is the answer, isn’t it? I want to defy the heavens, turn back time, and repeat the past. The deceased will be reborn.”</p>
<p>Ranran continued to probe, “The one you want to be reborn… is it the person in the grave right now?”</p>
<p>The man took a few steps back, looking down at the tomb, “The person lying here is someone I once wronged. But she should have already reincarnated by now, living a new life. Why would I disturb her peace?”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, a sudden thought flashed through Ranran’s mind, something she had never considered before…</p>
<p>Thinking of this, she suddenly asked, “May I ask, do you know the powerful cultivator Duntian?”</p>
<p>The man sneered, “He’s long dead. Why do you ask about him?”</p>
<p>With that, he ignored the two intruders in the mountain and turned to leave. But at that moment, Ranran started humming the tune she had learned on Tianmai Mountain.</p>
<p>Her melodious voice echoed in this chaotic graveyard, carrying a hint of indescribable bitterness and desolation.</p>
<p>The man, who had intended to leave, suddenly stopped in his tracks upon hearing Ranran’s singing. Gradually, his shoulders began to shake, and he turned around abruptly, his voice hoarse, “Stop singing!”</p>
<p>His shout carried an oppressive qi, rushing straight towards Ranran, who was singing softly.</p>
<p>Where the shockwave passed, dust and stones flew, demonstrating its astonishing force!</p>
<p>By the side, Su Yi Shui immediately raised a spiritual shield to block the man’s attack, but the immense force caused intense pain to Su Yi Shui’s entire body, almost as if his meridians were about to tear apart.</p>
<p>He could barely withstand it, was not because of his profound cultivation but because the man, in his anger, had clearly held back.</p>
<p>“I know the purpose of your visit here. But now you should understand that with your strength, you’re just ants trying to shake a tree,” said the man.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Xue Ranran tightly held Su Yi Shui’s hand, as she stared intently at the man, and said with certainty “You… could you be the powerful cultivator who should have passed away…Duntian?”</p>
<p>The man, upon hearing this, calmly said, “You are indeed very clever. Not only does your singing resemble Yao’er’s, but your intelligence is also similar…”</p>
<p>Duntian’s wife was named Rong Yao, so by saying this, he tacitly confirmed Ranran’s statement, admitting that he was indeed Duntian.</p>
<p>During the great battle between Duntian and the Demon King, Duntian ascended to become an immortal due to his choice to abandon his wife and child in the fight.</p>
<p>However, in the endless years that followed, he was immersed in the pain of losing his loved ones. If he was Duntian, then the intention behind building this Heaven-Defying Tower was clear — he wanted to turn back time, to make a different choice before his battle with the Demon King.</p>
<p>Such an insane idea, coming from an immortal?</p>
<p>If Ranran had not verified it herself, she really couldn’t believe it?</p>
<p>“You… just because of a regretful choice from years ago, you went to such lengths, opened the Netherworld privately, released demons, attacked orthodox sects, openly defying the heavenly laws… Have you forgotten that you’re an immortal, a divine being who should protect all living beings?”</p>
<p>Upon hearing Ranran’s accusations, the man laughed bitterly and then slowly took off his mask…</p>
<p>When Ranran saw the man’s face, she couldn’t help but gasp again in shock.</p>
<p>Duntian’s original appearance should have been very handsome, and one could still vaguely discern his former features from the left side of his face. However, the skin on the right side of his face had already decayed, revealing raw flesh, making him look like a corpse. It was no wonder he masked the herbal scent. Without it, his rotten odor would be difficult to conceal.</p>
<p>At that moment, Duntian chuckled coldly, “Little girl, do you still see me as an immortal? What’s the point of telling someone who’s already fallen into darkness about what they can or cannot do? Isn’t that ridiculous?”</p>
<p>Ranran pulled Su Yi Shui and took several steps back.</p>
<p>Duntian had once ascended as an immortal but had fallen into the demonic path as an immortal.</p>
<p>He had fallen into darkness, but was hundreds of times more frightening than a mortal becoming a demon.</p>
<p>Because Duntian was once a god, but he fell from the immortal path into the demonic path, such a scenario was unheard of to Ranran.</p>
<p>If a person fell into darkness, they could still be subdued. But what about a former immortal who had fallen into darkness? What kind of a dangerous and terrifying existence could they be?</p>
<p>At that moment, thunder rumbled again above Kongshan, and in an instant, thunderclouds gathered, and the calamity of a thousand tribulations was about to strike again.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>
<p>*Did Mu Ranwu not realize that their Xishan Master had only taken the two of them in as a ‘package deal’ only because he saw the potential in Mu Qingge? lol how foolish of her to expect him to still accept her with her mediocre talent for cultivation. This should be the biggest flaw in her plan? I don’t get it. Unless she thinks time reverses from this point, where her body is Mu Qingge’s and so she was the one blessed with innate talent? <em>Time travel in xiania lol </em></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">雷霆一击    STRIKE OF LIGHTNING</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Ranran furrowed her brows and asked, “After experiencing so many twists and turns to finally become an immortal, why would you fall into the demonic way? Don’t you know that such actions will inevitably bring forth heavenly retribution?”</p>
<p>Duntian seemed unfazed by the thunderous storm, with a casual wave of his hand, and the protective shield over Kongshan became even stronger.</p>
<p>This action seemed to silently answer Ranran’s question — he simply didn’t care about the ostentatious Heavenly calamity. After falling into the demonic path, Duntian gained supreme power surpassing gods. Naturally, he acted without scruples and didn’t care about right or wrong anymore.</p>
<p>He didn’t seem to harbor ill intentions towards the intruding duo, but this puzzled Ranran even more. Many things seemed to have the traces of Duntian’s manipulation behind them. What was his purpose in doing all this?</p>
<p>“Dare I ask, Senior, why have you appeared before me several times to guide me? What is your intention?” She didn’t believe he was acting on a whim, suddenly wanting to do good deeds. “Moreover, what is the meaning of sending people to capture us?”</p>
<p>Duntian cast a glance at her, seemingly reluctant to answer that question. However, his gaze towards Su Yi Shui became slightly more focused, with strong disappointment in his eyes.</p>
<p>He said mildly, “If I had known this would happen, I wouldn’t have alarmed you two so soon. You are not ready yet… You will understand in the future. If you are unwilling to leave, you can stay here. They won’t trouble you, but I hope you don’t attempt to damage the ancient tower. They won’t let you succeed…”</p>
<p>After saying these nonsensical words, Duntian vanished like a gust of wind, leaving no trace behind.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran felt that Duntian’s kindness towards her and Su Yi Shui was actually a kind of contempt. When you have absolute power, you don’t bother looking down to see what a couple of ants are up to.</p>
<p>Duntian was once an immortal, standing in the clouds. However, in his heart, did the once cherished mortal beings of the world gradually became insignificant, like ants?</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui asked Ranran to wait for him at the foot of Kongshan, as he wanted to try something at the Spirit Tower. However, Ranran refused and shook her head, insistent on accompanying him.</p>
<p>When they arrived under the Spirit Tower, none of the Fantian disciples stopped them, allowing them to come up all the way to the Black Bone Tower.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui narrowed his eyes at the black bone tower and suddenly tried to push it with his power. Before he could touch it, he was flung out and crashed through the trunks of three thick trees.</p>
<p>The unfinished ancient tower now already possessed a concealed demonic nature, making it impossible for anyone to approach. Even those constructing the bone tower only scattered bones from afar, and the tower would automatically absorb them to gradually take shape.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Ranran began twitching her nose again, as if sensing some unusual scent.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui knew that this little gourmet’s sense of smell was extraordinary. Just as he was about to ask what she smelled, Ranran asked, “What should we do?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui’s expression turned grave. “Let’s leave first, and inform others about the situation here.”</p>
<p>Dealing with someone who was once an immortal but now turned into a demon was a precarious matter. They needed to inform the other immortals hovering in mid-air and see if they had any solutions or could bring reinforcements.</p>
<p>When the intermittent thunder from the Heavenly calamity stopped, Su Yi Shui used his old method to take Ranran and the white tiger out of the protective shield.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>However, when they emerged, the Heavenly calamity from above seemed even fiercer than when they entered. Lightning mixed with purple light continuously exploded overhead, and the frequency grew denser.</p>
<p>At the moment they emerged, the thundering should have paused momentarily to let them pass through. But the next wave of lightning followed closely.</p>
<p>So, the two, along with the white tiger, had to dodge swiftly, hoping to pass through quickly.</p>
<p>Just as they were about to exit the array, a lightning bolt flashed towards Xue Ranran. </p>
<p>Seeing that Xue Ranran couldn’t dodge in time, without any hesitation, Su Yi Shui instinctively changed direction and quickly knocked Ranran out of the thunder array.</p>
<p>And the lightning, glowing with purple light, struck Su Yi Shui directly.</p>
<p>After Xue Ranran was knocked out of the thunder array, she turned around and saw Su Yi Shui being struck by lightning, and couldn’t help but cry out. She turned to enter the array again, but the white tiger that had just leaped out seemed to know how powerful the thunder array was and used its body to block Ranran.</p>
<p>Seeing the light in the white tiger’s eyes, Ranran instantly understood that Su Yi Shui’s primordial spirit had already possessed the white tiger’s body at the moment of the lightning strike.</p>
<p>So, the one blocking her from entering the array now was Su Yi Shui’s himself. However, his physical body was still inside the array. If they didn’t pull him out quickly, Su Yi Shui would be stuck as a tiger for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t have time to think. She just remembered how Su Yi Shui had guided the lightning with silver needles. She took out something she had on her, and threw it hard towards the lightning bolt.</p>
<p>What she had thrown out, was the box she obtained on Dragon Island which could not be opened. This was left behind by Mu Qingge, but she had never been able to open it.</p>
<p>The item was made of a metal similar to refined iron and was indeed conductive. The lightning in the sky was instantly attracted to the box, sparing the man from being struck by lightning.</p>
<p>At that moment, the white tiger leaped quickly into the thunder array, threw the body onto its back, and turned to run. After being struck by lightning, the iron box actually did not turn into smoke but was bounced out with a crack, the lid opening and falling at Xue Ranran’s feet.</p>
<p>But at this moment, Ranran didn’t have time to look at it. She just put it back in her pocket, then hugged Su Yi Shui’s body, which was covered in wounds from the lightning strike, and looked over him anxiously.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Just then, the Medicine Immortal and the others hurried over. They had seen Su Yi Shui’s body being struck by the Heavenly calamity from afar.</p>
<p>Ordinary cultivators wouldn’t dare to face heavenly thunder unless it was their ascension time. There were even those unscrupulous masters who used their disciples to attract thunder for their own benefits during tribulations.</p>
<p>What Su Yi Shui had faced was not ordinary heavenly tribulation but the Ten Thousand Tribulations Heavenly calamity. So, after being struck, his chances of survival were slim.</p>
<p>But Xue Ranran didn’t care about all that. She desperately stuffed medicinal pills into Su Yi Shui’s mouth and activated her technique to protect his heart meridians.</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal, who had been on the path of medical immortality, also quickly extended his hand to protect Su Yi Shui’s heart meridians.</p>
<p>However, he couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise, “His body hasn’t been destroyed yet. Why is there no primordial spirit?”</p>
<p>Ranran felt the body under her hands slowly resumed breathing, and she let out a sigh of relief. She pointed to the white tiger beside her and said, “His primordial spirit is in this tiger.”</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal furrowed his brows without speaking. Although they had extended timely treatment and the girl’s pills was potent, according to common sense, Su Yi Shui’s body should have been badly charred. </p>
<p>Why was he only slightly injured with no major problems?</p>
<p>Thinking about how this mortal had once managed to guide Mu Qingge’s soul to be reborn on the tree, the Medicine Immortal found this man attached to the tiger was even more difficult to figure out than before…</p>
<p>Because Su Yi Shui’s body had suffered a heavy blow from the lightning, his primordial spirit needed to return to his body as soon as possible.</p>
<p>However, at the moment he returned, the pain from the lightning strike immediately invaded his senses. The man, who should have fallen into a coma, immediately moaned quietly in pain.</p>
<p>Ranran held his hand tightly with tears of distress in her eyes, and gently applied a cooling ointment to his wounds to ease the pain.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu circled many times around Su Yi Shui, seemingly weighing the chances of killing his archenemy, and the pros and cons of retaining or breaking alliances.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran glanced at the corner of her eye and immediately understood Wei Jiu’s intentions. So she immediately threw out the shocking news, disrupting Wei Jiu’s plans.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>She briefly explained the situation inside. When she mentioned that Duntian, who should have passed into Nirvana, had turned into a demon and was the mastermind behind the Fantian Sect, everyone’s expression changed. Even the immortals looked at each other, and their indifferent faces finally showed some changes.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu looked at the immortals with a cold gaze and said, “A god from the divine class willingly fell and stirred up unrest in the Three Realms? Don’t tell me none of you noticed anything?”</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal’s expression was solemn, and he suddenly spoke, “I remember when Duntian passed, the four tools of the Four gods of time had suddenly disappeared. Could they be… taken by Duntian?”<br/>*四值功曹 <em>four deities in charge of time, Year, Month, Day and Hour</em></p>
<p>The Four gods who managed time, had four tools, coronas, that had the power to adjust the seasons.</p>
<p>When the four coronas had disappeared, the Four deities were indeed panicked for a while. In the end, they barely managed by using the Eye of Zhu Long, which also could control the changes of time.<br/>*烛龙 : 钟山的山神，无足之龙，开眼为昼、闭眼为夜<br/><em>The mountain god of Clock Mountain, a dragon with no feet; when its eyes opened its day, when its eyes closed its night</em></p>
<p>If that were really the case, Duntian’s ascension had been a long-planned conspiracy. The four bone towers he built corresponded to the four coronas, thus, they indeed had the ability to reverse time!</p>
<p>When the Medicine Immortal mentioned this, the other immortals also became agitated.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Two of them exchanged looks and immediately turned and hurried back to the Heavenly Realm to report what was happening here to the higher gods.</p>
<p>They were just minor lower gods and couldn’t make decisions on such major events.</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal, along with the white-haired immortal who had previously taught Wei Jiu a lesson, stayed behind to continue monitoring the situation at Kongshan.</p>
<p>According to the Medicine Immortal, other mountains were also experiencing thunderstorms. Duntian seemed to have the ability to split himself and had protective shields on all four mountains, resisting the Ten Thousand Tribulations Heavenly Calamity.</p>
<p>At this moment, Su Yi Shui seemed to have recovered well. After a long period of silence, he slowly stood up and asked, “Other than the Ten Thousand Tribulations Heavenly Calamity, is there any other way to dismantle the bone tower?”</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal sighed, “I have never seen such a tower that defies the heavens, so how would I know how to unravel it? Now we can only wait for the higher gods’ response and see if they can come up with a strategy.”</p>
<p>That’s all they could do for now, so they patiently waited under Kongshan.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The Medicine Immortal’s character was still not too bad. During the time they had while waiting, he cleared the black rain mud around Kongshan and treated the wounds of the injured. With a wave of his hand, the medicine healed their wounds, earning him the people’s respect, who bowed repeatedly, wanting to build temples and statues for him in the future.</p>
<p>However, true immortals seemed uninterested in earthly offerings and he quickly erased the memories of the people with a wave, sending them back home.</p>
<p>According to the Medicine Immortal, after becoming a god, if there were too many people thinking of them in the mortal world, it would actually be a burden on their cultivation. After all, responding to too many worldly desires would keep them very busy.</p>
<p>Most people who ascended to immortality, other than seeking eternal life, desired inner peace. If immortals were like magistrates who managed all kinds of trivial mundane affairs, won’t that only add to their troubles?</p>
<p>So, many ascended immortals even abandoned their secular names, seeking a state of pure tranquility without any attachments.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran listened to all this in astonishment. Clearly, these true immortals were far from the benevolent saviors of mankind as she had imagined. Thinking about those who constantly bothered the immortals with offerings, perhaps the immortals were gritting their teeth while accepting offerings and cursing from their caves!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After applying ointment to Su Yi Shui’s wounds, although the pain eased, the wounds healed very slowly. The usual methods of rapid recovery for cultivators seemed ineffective against the thunderous tribulations of the Ten Thousand Tribulations Heavenly Calamity.</p>
<p>Before sunset, another heavy rain fell. Xue Ranran was afraid that the rain would wash over Su Yi Shui’s wounds, so she chose a spot under a low tree on a hillside, used her spiritual power to create a spirit shield to block the rain, and then moved Su Yi Shui, who was resting in a state of recovery, under the tree.</p>
<p>Afterward, Xue Ranran sat silently beside him, gazing at the bone tower under the dark clouds of Kongshan.</p>
<p>It was unclear how much time passed, but Su Yi Shui finally woke up. Slowly opening his eyes, accompanied by the pouring rain, he looked at the girl sitting quietly beside him. He sat up and draped the cloak on him over her, then asked softly, “What are you thinking about?”</p>
<p>Ranran turned to look at him, carefully avoiding his wounds, reached out to hold his arm, and whispered, “I’m thinking, if Duntian really reverses time and changes everything, maybe we won’t get to meet again?”</p>
<p>Such a reversal of fate, if it happened, would likely cause a chain reaction. By then, with the world undergoing tremendous changes, they might become two insignificant specks, never to meet again, strangers forever…</p>
<p>Thinking about this, Ranran couldn’t help but feel a bit melancholic.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui didn’t seem to like her hypothesis. He just held her hand gently, then said softly, “Don’t worry, he won’t succeed…”</p>
<p>Listening to Su Yi Shui’s firm tone, Ranran’s rare moment of uncertainty instantly dissipated. She raised her spirits and said, “I won’t let him succeed either. He doesn’t know how difficult it was for me to take you all in as disciples back then. So, no one should think of making me start over!”</p>
<p>Her words made Su Yi Shui frown, recalling the mischievous look of this little demoness when she used various tricks to take him as a disciple.</p>
<p>He couldn’t help but ask in a low voice “You’re only reluctant to part with your disciples?”</p>
<p>Ranran tilted her head, looking uncertain “Of course, a few less disciples probably wouldn’t matter. Maybe… it would be better if you… hadn’t met me… ah!”</p>
<p>Before she could finish her sentence, Su Yi Shui had already pulled her into his arms. “Bad habits die hard! You first provoke me and then say such nonsense. Tell me, which disciple do you want to abandon if you were to reverse time?”</p>
<p>Ranran looked at his stern face, couldn’t help but laugh softly, and said as if coaxing a child, “Alright, even if I don’t want the others, I will still accept my little disciple Shui’er… ah… um…”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui clearly didn’t want to hear his carefree master’s nonsense anymore, so he simply sealed her remaining words with his lips… In the meantime, between kisses, he whispered, “If you dare say such things again, don’t blame me for making you copy the sect rules…”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran had originally closed her eyes to accept his passionate kiss. When she heard this, she gradually opened her eyes, looking at Su Yi Shui with disbelief, and slowly said, “You… remembered?”</p>
<p>Making his disciples copy sect rules was something that Su Yi Shui loved to do the most before he lost his memories. She almost had swollen wrists from being punished by him back then…</p>
<p>As she looked up to closely examine the man in front of her, Su Yi Shui’s facial features remained unchanged, but the gloominess and cynicism between his brows disappeared, replaced by a calmness honed by the passing of time…</p>
<p>After being struck by lightning just now, her… her Shifu had finally returned! Su Yi Shui reached out and embraced Ranran, ignoring the pain in his wounds, and tightly held her in his arms.</p>
<p>When he was struck by that heavenly thunder, the effectiveness of the Soul-cleansing talisman was completely nullified, and memories of Mu Qingge and Ranran rushed into his mind like a torrential river.</p>
<p>No one could know what Su Yi Shui felt at that moment, only his lingering fear.</p>
<p>Fear that he had almost killed Ranran, fear that Ranran would distance herself from him because of this, fear that he had endured for twenty years, only to face such a twist of fate…</p>
<p>Fortunately, Ranran did not give up on him. Otherwise, he would definitely be strangling himself now, killing the reckless and selfish self who had lost his memory…</p>
<p>At this moment, heavy rain poured down. the two who had been together day and night but felt like they had been apart for a long time, were under the cover of the spiritual shield, with many things to say…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Wei Jiu lay diagonally on a large rock, able to see from afar through the heavy rain, beneath the tree on the hillside, where a pair was partially obscured.</p>
<p>Although raindrops splashed on the spiritual shield, making it impossible to see clearly inside or hear what they were saying.</p>
<p>But Wei Jiu wasn’t a naive child; he could naturally imagine what a man and a woman alone could do.</p>
<p>Those imagined, sickeningly sweet Xishan styles had obviously repulsed Lord Wei Jiu.</p>
<p>He couldn’t help but glare at the other disciples of Xishan and said, “What are we doing at this critical juncture? Your Sect Leader, who was just struck by lightning, still has the mind to enjoy romantic moments. Do you expect such a person to change the current  disadvantaged situation? I think we might as well wait for our doom.”</p>
<p>Gao Cang and Bai Baishan didn’t like to engage with this devil, but thinking that if Duntian succeeded, causing chaos in the world, they were both worried and anxious.</p>
<p>Especially Gao Cang, he didn’t want the world to start over again. Whether it was his master, his junior siblings, or his loved one, Qiu Xier, he didn’t want to miss any of them.</p>
<p>Now the distant tall tower seemed to be almost completed. No one knew what earth-shattering events would happen next.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But at this moment, the Medicine Immortal and the white-haired immortal who had been sitting there suddenly opened their eyes, their faces serious, and their lips trembling slightly.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu knew they were probably communicating with someone, but as immortals, their ability to communicate over long distances was extraordinary. They could sense each other even from thousands of miles away.</p>
<p>The white-haired immortal was still fine, but the Medicine Immortal seemed to be arguing with someone. However, in the end, he seemed to have been persuaded by someone. Helpless, he sighed deeply and said to Su Yi Shui and Xue Ranran, who had just come over, “I’m leaving, and you should leave quickly too… Activate all your spiritual power and go as far as possible!”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui looked at the Medicine Immortal’s serious expression and narrowed his eyes, saying, “Would the Immortal please explain clearly, what decision has the divine class in the Heavenly Realm made regarding the Tower of Reversal?”</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal looked at Su Yi Shui. He originally didn’t want to reveal the heaven’s mandate, but for some reason, he decided to speak up in the end. “…The Towers of Reversal must not be allowed to be completed. Otherwise, there will be chaos in the Three Realms. Since the Ten Thousand Tribulations Heavenly Calamity cannot destroy the tower, then we must activate the earth’s veins and level the four mountains…”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu, hearing this, glared angrily, “Are you all mad?! This way of doing things is even more like the demonic path compared to my actions! Once the earth’s veins are activated, the entire surface within a radius will be overturned! By then, not just the four mountains, but even the manors and farms within a thousand miles will be destroyed! It will be a scene of extensive devastation, with great suffering… From what I can see, you immortals are not any wiser than Duntian in your actions!”</p>
<p>Faced with Wei Jiu’s accusations, the Medicine Immortal also sighed deeply, “You’re right, but if there were any other way out, the Heavenly Realm wouldn’t make such a decision. But now that the towers are about to be completed, if Duntian succeeds, the chaos caused in the Three Realms will be much worse than the destruction of the four mountains. Given the lesser of two evils, sacrifices must be made to stop Duntian’s madness.”</p>
<p>There was another part that the Medicine Immortal didn’t say out loud. As a lower immortal, his opinion was insignificant, and the higher immortals only informed him to evacuate quickly, and did not consult with him. By himself, he could not reverse the decision of the higher immortals.</p>
<p>“What I can do to help you ends here. Tomorrow at noon, when yin and yang intersects and the tower is about to be completed, the earth’s veins will tremble, and the entire surface will be overturned… Find a safe place to take refuge yourselves…”</p>
<p>With that, the Medicine Immortal turned to leave.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But at that moment, a cold voice came from behind him, “You once aspired to become an immortal wholeheartedly, just to be the Heavenly Realm’s lackey and messenger? How did that spirited cultivator who was full of ideals and wanted to save the masses, end up being such a submissive person?”</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal’s body jolted, and he slowly turned around to look at the cold woman standing behind him, whose presence he hadn’t noticed until then.</p>
<p>She had golden hair and dragon horns, with a heroic aura, but unfortunately, a prominent scar on her face made people overlook her lively phoenix eyes…</p>
<p>“Fengmou!” the Medicine Immortal recognized the woman in front of him and cried out involuntarily. She was his lover before he ascended to immortality—Fengmou, the guardian god of Dragon Island.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">与你无关   NONE OF YOUR CONCERN</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>The Medicine Immortal could never have expected to meet his former lover, Fengmou, here. When he saw the scar on her face, his heart, which had become somewhat indifferent after ascending to immortality, suddenly tightened.</p>
<p>The white-haired immortal by the side was already impatient, feeling that the Medicine Immortal was talking too much with these mortals.</p>
<p>Now that even the guardian deity of Dragon Island has also appeared here, the white-haired immortal said coldly, “The orders from the higher immortals have been given, we shouldn’t linger here for too long. I’ll go on ahead.”</p>
<p>After saying that, he vanished into the clouds.</p>
<p>However, the Medicine Immortal couldn’t move his feet, only stared at Fengmou intently and asked “Are you here to see me?”</p>
<p>The guardian deity of Dragon Island looked at her former lover with cold eyes and said lightly, “I came here to settle the blood feud of the Dragon Clan. You should be returning to the Heavenly realm.”</p>
<p>She was not lying.</p>
<p>Because she did come here for revenge. When Ranran and the others left Dragon Island, she had told Ranran that if she found out who killed the Green Dragon on the island, she must inform her, and she would definitely avenge the Green Dragon.</p>
<p>The vengeful power of the Dragon Clan was unmatched. Such a large Green Dragon had been drained of blood alive by someone, and as the guardian deity of Dragon Island, she must avenge this grievance.</p>
<p>So when Ranran used water as a medium to draw a talisman on the spot and conveyed this message to Dragon Island, she broke through the imprisonment of Dragon Island once again and left the island seeking the murderer.</p>
<p>At this moment, Ranran also said, “When I was in Kongshan, I smelled a strong scent of Green Dragon’s blood on the black bone tower. I immediately understood that the blood binding those bones was from the Green Dragon. So when we were taking shelter from the rain earlier, I passed the message to the guardian deity of Dragon Island, asking her to come and check it out.”</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal shook his head with some anxiety, “This place will be leveled to the ground soon, so you all should leave quickly. Even if you know that the Green Dragon was killed by Duntian, you are powerless!”</p>
<p>However, after Xue Ranran and Su Yi Shui exchanged a glance, Ranran clasped her fists and said, “Old Immortal, this is related to the lives of tens of thousands of people. How can we cultivators shirk responsibility at this critical moment? We want to try again, see if we can destroy the bone tower before the Heavenly punishment arrives, and avoid this catastrophe of the mortal realm!”</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal continued to shake his head helplessly, “If there were other ways, the heavenly realm would not resort to this extreme measure! This is the only way to stop Duntian’s madness… You should stop trying, use this time to notify the surrounding people to evacuate quickly.”</p>
<p>But after he finished speaking, he found no one responding. Su Yi Shui had called the disciples of Xishan to him, instructed them in a low voice, and then the disciples went down the mountain one after another. It’s unclear whether they were informing the people to evacuate.</p>
<p>But with only one day and night, it’s impossible to evacuate so many people from all over the land. </p>
<p>It was also likely that if they spoke of the impending catastrophe, people would just consider them a group of lunatics. Even if the Emperor of Daqi issued an edict for so many people to leave their homes and abandon their properties and lands, it wouldn’t be easy.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Thinking of this, the Medicine Immortal looked at Fengmou again and found that there was also a young man with horns standing beside her, who seemed to be clinging to her. </p>
<p>Fengmou stood aside, looking at the black tower on Kongshan, lost in thought.</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal didn’t want to leave like this. He walked over and wanted to say something to her again, but the young man with horns suddenly jumped in front of Fengmou, showing his teeth menacingly at him, clearly still in his beastly mode despite having taken human form recently.</p>
<p>“Little Dragon, don’t be like this,” the guardian deity of Dragon Island reprimanded the youth with dragon horns in a low voice. He was her adopted son, who had taken human form early with her blessing of her golden light but still couldn’t speak, only making sounds similar to dragon cries.</p>
<p>So after she scolded him, the young man blinked his eyes innocently and made sounds like a whimpering puppy.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran watched her rescued little dragon, still not changing his ingrained habits, fond of guarding his food, couldn’t help but shake her head and smile, reaching out to pull the little dragon aside.</p>
<p>It had been a long time since these two had seen each other, and right now was an exceptionally dangerous moment. They would certainly have some private words to say about the bitterness of separation.</p>
<p>So Ranran deliberately pulled the child aside, not wanting to delay their reunion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Fengmou seemed to deliberately turn her head to one side, not wanting to let the Medicine Immortal see the scarred half of her face. The Medicine Immortal also sensed her discomfort, and could only hold his breath and ask her, “Was it because of this scar on your face that you left me with a letter, without saying goodbye back then?”</p>
<p>Fengmou didn’t speak, seeming to tacitly agree. The Medicine Immortal felt a sharp pain in his heart: “I thought… you were afraid, so you…”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Ranran’s best intentions was being let down. The Medicine Immortal had walked up, but before he could say anymore to Fengmou, a female immortal descended from the sky.</p>
<p>Ranran looked at the female immortal, her head crowned with purple aura, who was the companion of the Medicine Immortal called Yulian Immortal when he floated lotus lanterns by the river.</p>
<p>It seemed as if sensing the reunion of the Medicine Immortal with his former lover, Yulian Immortal appeared in time and reminded the Medicine Immortal that it was time for him to leave.</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal had never known that Fengmou’s appearance had been damaged in that divine punishment, and she felt so inferior that she didn’t want to see him. Thinking of how she had been alone on Dragon Island for so many years, he felt a surge of guilt.</p>
<p>Now with Yulian appearing and holding his arm, he felt a bit embarrassed, with a hint of awkwardness on his face.</p>
<p>He wanted to explain to Fengmou that the Heavenly realm’s companionship was just a cultivation partner in the same immortal cave, accompanying each other in cultivation, without the passionate emotions of ordinary men and women.</p>
<p>But all explanations froze seeing Fengmou’s cold eyes.</p>
<p>She suddenly turned her face straight on, no longer avoiding, allowing her scarred face to be exposed in front of these immortal companions. She took a glance at the declarative hand-holding between the Medicine Immortal and Yulian Immortal, sneered, then suddenly leaped up and transformed into a dragon, flying towards Kongshan.</p>
<p>Because the heavenly realm had made a decision, the Heavenly calamity also ceased, the rain storm over Kongshan ceased, but the dark clouds did not dissipate, seemingly brewing an even greater heavenly punishment.</p>
<p>And the rising golden dragon floating above Kongshan dispersed the gloom, making everyone involuntarily look at the golden dragon.</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal shook off Yulian Immortal’s hand, as he watched the dancing golden dragon, once again recalling the past… Fengmou was such a proud person, and now he finally understood why she proposed to part ways back then. It wasn’t because she was afraid of divine punishment, but because she wanted to fulfill his path of immortal cultivation. She was even more afraid that he would feel guilty seeing her disfigured appearance, so she left without a word.</p>
<p>He was wrong. Over these years, if he had gone to Dragon Island just once and understood her thoughts, would he have made the so many mistakes, one after the other?</p>
<p>The guardian deity of Dragon Island came out this time to avenge the Green Dragon, even risking the danger of being punished again by heaven. Although at the moment of leaving the island, there was still a faint hope in her heart of seeing her former lover again, to tell him personally to forget her, and not to release those lotus lanterns drifting to Dragon Island every year.</p>
<p>But now, she felt that perhaps those lanterns floating every year were not reminiscing about her…</p>
<p>A slightly throbbing heart could gradually turn cold. Dragons are a race not easily swayed by emotions. Once emotions are severed, they would be cut off with a sharp sword.</p>
<p>Having seen the vastness of the world, soaring in the sky as a dragon god, how could she accommodate sharing his heart with another woman?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Xue Ranran watched the situation in front of her, seeing the Medicine Immortal’s regretful and sorrowful expression, feeling a sense of melancholy in her heart.</p>
<p>Although she had lived two lives as a human, her understanding of “love” was still not very deep.</p>
<p>Back then, this guardian deity of Dragon Island sacrificed her own cultivation and appearance for her lover to successfully ascend, willingly destroying her own cultivation and appearance, and proposed to part ways, fulfilling her lover. This was a willingness to sacrifice oneself, loving with hidden restraint.</p>
<p>And Duntian, after becoming an immortal, willingly fell and became a demon, wanting to reverse time and space even at the cost of destroying heaven and earth, in order to save his wife and children again. That was also for “love”, being willing to sacrifice everything without reservation.</p>
<p>These two kinds of “love” seemed similar but were completely different, which made Ranran feel a bit melancholic.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, she couldn’t help but turn her head to look at Su Yi Shui beside her and said, “If something unexpected happens to me, you must never become like Duntian, becoming a demon without any regard… Otherwise, I…”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui immediately understood, he continued “Otherwise, you would never accept me like that, nor would you accept a rebirth bought with bloodshed.”</p>
<p>He understood her too well. However, he couldn’t help but ask in a low voice, “But… if something unexpected happens to me, how would you react?”</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t even think about it and said, “Even if my soul scatters, I will protect you!”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui’s eyes narrowed fiercely, as if back to the time when he had lost his memories, said with a sinister tone, “You — dare!”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran knew that her mention of “soul scattering” touched on her Shifu’s raw nerve, bringing back the unpleasant memories he had just regained. But at that moment of glaring, it was as if her Shifu who lost his memories, had possessed him.</p>
<p>But Ranran knew that no matter which side of Su Yi Shui appeared, it was still his true self. The rebelliousness of his youth had never disappeared, but had been well hidden under maturity and restraint as he grew older.</p>
<p>No matter which side of him, she still liked it… Thinking of this, she didn’t say anything else, just held his hand tightly.</p>
<p>An unimaginable great battle was about to come. Regardless of the outcome, she wanted to be with him, in life or in death.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The guardian deity of Dragon Island, who had circled above Kongshan in dragon form, transformed back into a human form and walked over, saying to Ranran and Su Yi Shui, “I went above Kongshan just now, and the tower is indeed stained with the Green Dragon’s blood. Duntian has killed my clansmen, we will be irreconcilable… However, although this Heaven-Defying Tower is built, if it is to be activated, using only the blood of the Green Dragon as a blood sacrifice is not enough; it also requires a sacrificial offering. If you want to destroy the tower, you must not let the sacrifice succeed.”</p>
<p>“Sacrifice?” Ranran furrowed her brows slightly.</p>
<p>The guardian deity of Dragon Island nodded, saying in a low voice, “The operation of the Heaven-Defying Tower inherits the obsession of humans. Only with deep enough obsession can the tower go against heaven and reverse time and space. Therefore, the person making the sacrifice must have enough regrets and an obsession to bring about change to drive the tower’s operation.”</p>
<p>Although Duntian’s obsession was strong enough, he would absolutely not sacrifice himself. It remained unknown where he would find someone to sacrifice for the spirit tower.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>By the side, Yulian Immortal couldn’t help but urge the Medicine Immortal to return to the heavenly realm quickly.</p>
<p>The situation here was simply a quandary. Being trapped here would lead to an irreversible calamity, especially with the guardian deity of Dragon Island here. She was even more anxious to get the Medicine Immortal to leave this dangerous place.</p>
<p>Just then, Ranran said, “I have already asked my senior brothers to contact the government when they went down the mountain. At the same time, I used talismans to command birds to send a message to Emperor Su Yu, trying to get as many people from the four mountains to relocate as possible. But considering the time, it’s definitely not enough, so we still want to do our best to stop Duntian. I wonder if the Medicine Immortal is willing to stay and help us?”</p>
<p>If it were before Fengmou scolded him, the Medicine Immortal might have reluctantly refused and reminded this little girl of the inevitability of fate.</p>
<p>However, Fengmou’s sarcastic words were still fresh in his mind. He also introspected, having lost his beloved, ascending to immortality, what was it all for? Was it just to stand high above the clouds during the calamity in the mortal world, pushing everything onto the inevitability of fate?</p>
<p>Now that Fengmou openly exposed the scar on her face without concealing it, yet those eyes that were once full of love never looked at him again.</p>
<p>There was a bitter feeling in the Medicine Immortal’s heart, mixed with a hundred emotions. But he knew that if Fengmou insisted on seeking revenge against Duntian, he would never leave her in this dangerous place and return to the heavenly realm alone.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he turned to Yulian Immortal and said “I want to stay here. You should hurry back… Also, after I return, I will find another immortal residence and live alone…”</p>
<p>With that, he turned around gracefully and walked away without looking back.</p>
<p>Yulian Immortal’s hands hidden in her long sleeves were trembling slightly, gritting her teeth. She turned around and flew back to the sky.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Because the calamity of the heavenly punishment had temporarily ceased, it was not as dangerous to approach Kongshan now.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui’s injuries from the lightning strikes had also been mostly healed by the Medicine Immortal’s treatment. After a brief reorganization, everyone prepared to enter Kongshan to destroy the spirit tower.</p>
<p>Although they didn’t have absolute confidence, but this time the group entering the mountain had the addition of the guardian deity of Dragon Island and the Medicine Immortal, two great powers. Although they might not be able to defeat Duntian who had turned from immortal to demon, at the very least, they could hold their ground.</p>
<p>As long as they could destroy the Heaven-Defying Spirit Tower, there would be no more incidents to defy heaven , and the Heavenly realm would not level the four mountains, causing suffering to the living beings.</p>
<p>They only had one day and one night left, time was limited and couldn’t be wasted any longer, so the group gradually arrived at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>Although the divine punishment had ceased for now, the great calamity was approaching, as if an invisible force was pressing down from the sky. The air pressure was so low that even many birds flapped their wings hard, struggling to fly low, flocking away in scattered groups.</p>
<p>Many beasts and rodents also came out of the mountains, rushing to escape in a panic.</p>
<p>And this group of people went against the flow of these birds and beasts, looking out of place. Because of this gradually descending pressure, even immortals like the Medicine Immortal were reluctant to waste effort floating in the air, and his shoes which hadn’t touched dust for a long time had to walk on the muddy ground.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Throughout this journey, Ranran seemed unaffected by the low air pressure, her mouth never idle as she ate the red sugarcane she got from the rescued villagers.</p>
<p>Several vendors selling sugarcane were very generous. Combined with the urgency to flee this area, they gave Ranran a large basket of sugarcane. Now that basket of sugarcane was on Su Yi Shui’s back.</p>
<p>The local sugarcane was sweet, but the juice was thicker in color, and the juice squeezed out was also a bright red. If one wasn’t careful, their mouth would turn rosy red.</p>
<p>As the great battle approached, everyone else was preoccupied, but the Xishan master and disciple of two lifetimes seemed so carefree. As Su Yi Shui walked along, he used his sharp sword that could cut metal like mud, to peel the sugarcane for Ranran, as if fearing she might not have enough.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu gave them the side-eye and couldn’t help but comment, “You guys are really leisurely. Are you afraid of death approaching and want to die with a full stomach?”</p>
<p>Ranran smiled faintly, “I thought you would sneak away quietly. Charging ahead like this doesn’t seem like your usual style, Lord Wei.”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu chuckled, “This kind of major battle will be recorded in the history of cultivation. Naturally, I want to enjoy it from the sidelines. Besides, those scoundrels in the heavenly realm have made a good account for themselves, even including my Red Flame Mountain’s centuries-old foundation into it. How can I fulfill their wishes?”</p>
<p>He was naturally rebellious, not following the orthodox path even during cultivation, and he had a natural aversion to those heavenly immortals. Even if he ascended in the future, he would likely fall into demonic path and not cultivate on any proper path.</p>
<p>But Ranran handed him a piece of peeled sugarcane, commending “Just for your statement of ‘not following their wishes,’ it’s worth a toast, but unfortunately, there’s no wine here. You’ll have to make do with sugarcane.”</p>
<p>This belated offering of “wine” by a beauty naturally made Wei Jiu’s eyes and eyebrows reveal a bit of smugness.</p>
<p>But just as he reached out to take it, Su Yi Shui snatched the piece of sugarcane away, “Lord Wei grinds his teeth at night, a sign of poor digestion. If you eat sugarcane, it might worsen the symptoms. Don’t harm our excellency here.”</p>
<p>Although Su Yi Shui was just being petty, he still displayed a frank and open appearance even in jealousy. With his memories restored, he also regained his sophisticated and subtly malicious demeanor.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu’s eyes narrowed coldly, “Nonsense! When did I grind my teeth?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui continued leisurely, “Naturally, it was when Your Excellency had a good dream on my bed…”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As the two bantered back and forth with cold remarks, suddenly, Ranran stopped in her tracks and pointed to the nearby river, “Look, what’s in the river?”</p>
<p>It turned out that due to the previous heavy rain, the nearby dried-up riverbed had filled with rainwater for a long time. Now that it was getting dark, with Ranran’s good eyesight, she suddenly saw something in the river. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a woman bobbing up and down in the water.</p>
<p>She was still entangled with a broken snake tail, and the strange pattern on it looked like the nine-headed monster snake.</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal waved his whisk and rescued the woman from the water. It was only then, as the woman coughed out water desperately, that Ranran recognized her as Elder Tu Jiuyuan!</p>
<p>Earlier at the inn, there was a Tu Jiuyuan who had split off from the nine-headed monster snake and came to cheat people. Now, another Tu Jiuyuan entangled with a snake tail appeared in the river, making people doubt her authenticity.</p>
<p>As Tu Jiuyuan coughed out water, Wei Jiu had already drawn out his whip and wrapped it around Tu Jiuyuan’s neck with a flick of his wrist.</p>
<p>“Speak, what does this fake want to do?”</p>
<p>After Tu Jiuyuan coughed out water, she was lifted up by the neck and could only weakly hold onto the whip with one hand, the other hand protecting her stomach, and she said with effort, “Your Excellency, it’s me, Tu Jiuyuan…”</p>
<p>Her hair was wet, the corners of her eyes were red, her voice hoarse, and the hand holding the whip had already wrinkled from soaking in water for a long time.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu relaxed his grip slightly and asked coldly, “Why are you here?”</p>
<p>After coughing twice, Tu Jiuyuan said, “A fake Excellency had infiltrated Red Flame Mountain. After I exposed him, he tricked me into going to the back mountain, wanting to kill me to silence me. Luckily, I’m familiar with the terrain and escaped through a volcanic cave. I wandered around and finally saw the hidden marks you left along the way, so I followed them to the Western Mountains. But by then, you had already gone to Kongshan with Su Yi Shui and the others. So, I tracked my way here, but was targeted by the *nine-headed monster snake, unfortunately got poisoned by the snake, and it split out a fake…”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu narrowed his eyes. When he went to the Western Mountains earlier, he did indeed leave marks to find his disciples. But how did Tu Jiuyuan discover that there was a fake on Red Flame Mountain?</p>
<p>Upon hearing his question, Tu Jiuyuan smiled bitterly, “Because he was too courteous to me, unlike Your Excellency’s hot and cold attitude…”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu was somewhat choked by his subordinate’s response, his phoenix eyes slanted slightly, coldly laughing, “Consider yourself not completely stupid!”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Ranran couldn’t help but ask, “After being replicated by it, how did you escape without being killed?”</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan fell silent for a moment, “I don’t know either, it’s just when it sprayed snake venom at me, there seemed to be something glowing in my abdomen, which let me escape…”</p>
<p>Her explanation was obviously not very believable, but fortunately, it was almost midnight when the yin and yang changed, and those holding torches could look at her shadow and know the truth.</p>
<p>However, the Medicine Immortal had already discerned the truth in advance. When he reached out to check her pulse, his brows furrowed, and said in a low voice “You… seem to be pregnant…”</p>
<p>If it’s a fake body split from the nine-headed monster snake, no matter how lifelike it is, it can’t fake the pregnancy pulse unique to humans. And the glowing inside Tu Jiuyuan’s abdomen that she mentioned, which blocked the snake venom for her, obviously came from the spiritually endowed fetus in her womb, who saved her from death.</p>
<p>After hearing the Medicine Immortal’s words, Wei Jiu was the first to give an outburst. He glared darkly at Tu Jiuyuan and her flat belly, and finally asked coldly, “Whose child is this?”</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan obviously knew about her pregnancy long before, as she had been unconsciously holding her belly since she came ashore, looking very cautious.</p>
<p>Now, hearing Wei Jiu’s question, her cheeks, which had just regained some color, turned pale again.</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan, with trembling lips finally said, “This is my private matter… it has nothing to do with Your Excellency!”</p>
<p>Ranran couldn’t bear to listen to Wei Jiu’s nonsense anymore. She pushed him aside, draped her cloak over Tu Jiuyuan, and said, “We happen to be camping here. Let the fire warm you up. Your body is too cold, be careful not to affect the fetus.”</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">真的假的    REAL OR FAKE</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>After saying that, Xue Ranran quickly lit a fire and let Tu Jiuyuan rest for a while. She also heated some sugarcane juice crushed with stones for her to drink.</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan glanced at Xue Ranran but didn’t thank her. She had grown up in a rather indifferent environment. If she accepted the kindness of others, she wouldn’t express gratitude, but she would remember it in her heart and would want to repay it as soon as possible, so as not to owe anyone.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu, on the other hand, watched on coldly, clearly neglecting Tu Jiuyuan who had just survived a disaster.</p>
<p>Actually, he knew in his heart that apart from himself, Tu Jiuyuan had no other man, and judging by the months, it couldn’t be the child of that fake. But she dared to secretly carry his child, which was already an unforgivable offense.</p>
<p>The Dragon youth beside the Dragon goddess, observing the situation with dissatisfaction, grunted. Xue Ranran couldn’t understand, so the Dragon goddess translated for him, “He said there are too many damned men here, he really wants to eat one up…”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Wei Jiu and the Medicine Immortal both glared at the boy, unsure of whom he was cursing.</p>
<p>The dragon youth silently tucked his head into the Dragon goddess’s arms, habitually arching for her to touch his little dragon horns.</p>
<p>This affectionate act made the Medicine Master Immortal feel rather sour.</p>
<p>But the situation was critical, and they didn’t have much time to dwell on the love and hatred between men and women.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Perhaps due to the excessive force used in resisting the Heavenly calamity earlier, the protective shield seemed to have less vigor than before. The Dragon Island guardian god transformed into a dragon again, and with a flick of her tail, she broke a corner of the shield, creating a gap.</p>
<p>As they entered, they encountered no resistance from the followers of the Fantian Sect. The mountain path was empty, with birds and beasts fleeing through the gap in the shield. The entire mountain seemed as deserted as its name suggested.</p>
<p>In this way, they arrived smoothly near the Spirit Tower.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the tower, they realized why they had encountered no obstacles along the way. It seemed that the tower had been almost completed, and the followers of the Fantian Sect couldn’t control themselves, committing suicide one after another, their blood splashing into the ditch at their feet and forming a small river absorbed by the Spirit Tower.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu was among them, uncontrollably drawing out her sword as well.</p>
<p>Her spiritual power far exceeded that of the other followers. Combined with witnessing the fate of those followers, her face was now ashen with fear, as she struggled to control her power and tried to release the sword in her hand.</p>
<p>But that power was too strong. She couldn’t control her hand at all. Just then, she saw Xue Ranran and the others rushing over and immediately screamed in panic, “Elder sister, hurry! Save me!”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran was truly disgusted by that “elder sister” term. But she also knew that she must not let the Spirit Tower complete its blood sacrifice, so she controlled her short sword and aimed for Mu Ranwu’s wrist, trying to knock the sword out of her hand.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu was exhausted at this point and couldn’t control her wrist anymore. Her sword, after deflecting the short blade, stabbed straight towards her own throat.</p>
<p>At this critical moment, Ranran’s other four short swords swiftly attacked.</p>
<p>Her skill in controlling the swords had become even more proficient, allowing her to simultaneously control five short blades at will. As the five blades swiftly attacked, they barely managed to block the sword aimed at Mu Ranwu’s throat.</p>
<p>In the gap where the sword was blocked, Su Yi Shui swung his hand and deflected the sword.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu, still unable to control herself, picked up another sword discarded by another follower and continued to try to cut her throat. By now, tears were streaming down her face. “Sister, please save me! I don’t want to die yet!”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran rushed up and used her mechanism staff to once again knock the sword out of Mu Ranwu’s hand.</p>
<p>As the sky grew darker, the Medicine Immortal raised true fire into the sky, illuminating the surroundings of the dark tower.</p>
<p>When the fire flickered, Xue Ranran noticed that Mu Ranwu’s eyes, which were close to her, had a moment where their pupils turned into thin lines like snake eyes, giving off an indescribable eerie feeling.</p>
<p>Although her pupils quickly returned to normal after being illuminated by the fire, this momentary change was enough to alert Xue Ranran.</p>
<p>Sure enough, just as Ranran leaned closer, Mu Ranwu’s sword suddenly reversed and stabbed directly at her.</p>
<p>Although Xue Ranran was wary now, it was still too late to dodge. She thought of the soft silver armor made for her by Zeng Yi and could only mobilize her true vitality to resist this sword.</p>
<p>But the sword in Mu Ranwu’s hand seemed to be very unusual. When it stabbed straight at her, it carried a sharp evil energy that could split mountains and stones, pierced through her protective true vitality, and stabbed straight at Xue Ranran’s chest.</p>
<p>Just as she thought she couldn’t dodge this sword, a hand suddenly extended from a diagonal direction, with two fingers holding the sword body, and true qi flowed along the fingers, making the sword emit a clang sound.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu looked up and saw that Su Yi Shui had arrived in time and caught the sword for Xue Ranran.</p>
<p>However, Mu Ranwu was not alarmed. She smirked maliciously and gently flipped her wrist holding the sword. Suddenly, more than a dozen long needles shot out from the handle of the sword, once again aiming at Xue Ranran.</p>
<p>This time, it was too fast. Although Su Yi Shui used true energy to send out a shockwave in time, one of the long needles still pierced through the true qi and stabbed directly at Xue Ranran’s chest.</p>
<p>Although she had the soft silver armor protecting her, the needle tip still pierced through Ranran’s skin.</p>
<p>In that instant, Ranran felt a fiery pain and immediately realized – this needle was contaminated, it seemed to have some kind of poison!</p>
<p>At this moment, Su Yi Shui had already reversed his sword and pierced through Mu Ranwu’s heart.</p>
<p>Only to see Mu Ranwu’s body quickly turning into green smoke, leaving behind only a grinning skull…</p>
<p>This “Mu Ranwu” was obviously fake, a creation of the nine-headed snake, which is why her eyes had a momentary snake-like change when facing the light.</p>
<p>Although the fake immediately perished, a green smoke started to rise from Xue Ranran’s head.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu and Tu Jiuyuan have experienced this. Seeing this situation, their faces changed, and they shouted together, “Not good! She’s been poisoned by the nine-headed python venom!”</p>
<p>Before they finished speaking, the green smoke condensed and indeed transformed into another Xue Ranran, identical in appearance and clothing, without any difference.</p>
<p>As soon as the fake formed, she suddenly turned and leaped towards the nearby bushes, disappearing without a trace.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran was fed a poison-clearing pill by Su Yi Shui, finally easing the pain from the snake venom.</p>
<p>At this moment, the ditch surrounding the Spirit Tower was flowing with thick black blood. After absorbing this blood, the Spirit Tower seemed to start breathing, as if it were a human body, undulating and wriggling.</p>
<p>However, these blood sacrifices were obviously just appetizers, not enough to activate the Spirit Tower.</p>
<p>Now Xue Ranran was more worried about why the Fantian Sect had gone to such lengths to create a shadow of herself?</p>
<p>Just then, the Medicine Immortal looked towards the top of the tower, his face suddenly changing, and he whispered, “The Demon King…”</p>
<p>Everyone looked up and saw a shiny golden skull at the top of the tower.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran and Su Yi Shui immediately recognized it as the skull of the Demon King that had been stolen from the secret cave in the Red Flame Mountain.</p>
<p>This skull had not been refined all this time, gathering the resentment of the Demon King. Now it was placed high on the tower, its purpose unknown.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran shouted, “Elder Duntian, please come out and talk!”</p>
<p>But her voice echoed in the empty mountains, with no response.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The bone tower was steeped with the blood of the Green dragon, a blatant provocation to the guardian god of the dragons. Therefore, the goddess couldn’t hold back anymore and transformed into a golden dragon again, accumulating true energy and fiercely attacking the tower.</p>
<p>Ranran immediately shouted, “Stop!”</p>
<p>The golden dragon charged too fast and didn’t listen to her. Just as its tail was about to sweep the tower, the black bone tower actually emitted a roar similar to a wild beast. Many sharp bone spurs suddenly appeared on its sticky and wriggling surface. These spurs could penetrate even the tough dragon scales, piercing through the golden dragon’s tail.</p>
<p>These bone spurs acted like mosquito proboscises, greedily sucking the dragon’s blood once they pierced through.</p>
<p>Dragon blood was the source of a dragon’s spiritual power. Once drained, their strength would greatly diminish. So the guardian goddess immediately let out a painful groan and quickly retreated, trying to shake off the bone tower.</p>
<p>However, the adhesive force of these bone spurs was extremely strong, firmly hooking onto the golden dragon.</p>
<p>At this moment, the Medicine Immortal and the Dragon youth were both alarmed and rushed over together.</p>
<p>The Dragon youth flipped his body, transforming into a dragon shimmering with flowing light, and used his dragon claws to pull the golden dragon, while the Medicine Immortal drew out a sharp blade and hacked at the adhered bone spurs.</p>
<p>With their combined effort, they finally rescued the guardian goddess.</p>
<p>When the golden dragon transformed back into human form and fell down exhausted, Ranran noticed that the bone spurs were embedded with barbs and were stuck in her flesh.</p>
<p>“No, this tower is alive, frantically absorbing the flesh and blood of nearby spirits. We have no way to overturn it!” </p>
<p>The goddess endured the severe pain and said in a low voice. No wonder the immortals of the heavenly realm made such a ruthless decision. Only by overturning the tower by leveling the lands and burying it deep in the abyss could they deal with it. They should have long anticipated that this tower would be difficult to approach, and both humans and gods were powerless against it!</p>
<p>Wei Jiu gritted his teeth, “What should we do? Will my years of foundation have to be buried along with Dun Tian’s Spirit Tower?”</p>
<p>All his foundation was in the Red Flame Mountain. If they couldn’t overturn the Spirit Tower, it meant that his many years of effort would be ruined. Moreover, the Spirit Towers chose locations with concentrated spiritual energy.</p>
<p>After the earth-leveling catastrophe, it would be difficult to find a suitable place for cultivation. When his spiritual energy is finally depleted, perhaps he would gradually age, fall ill and die like an ordinary mortal, achieving nothing but turning into dust.</p>
<p>Just then, the voice of Dun Tian echoed in the vast darkness, “If I don’t let you try, how would you know your own capabilities? This bone tower not only has the flesh and blood of the Green dragon but also boosted by the spiritual essence of the Demon King. It has become a tower with both form and spirit. You are no match for it, so don’t dream of ants shaking the tree…”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui looked around and loudly said, “The Heavenly realm will not allow you to go against the heavens. Instead of involving countless innocent lives, why not stop now!”</p>
<p>In the dark night, there came a melancholic laughter, “I just want to retrieve my most precious thing, but there are so many people trying to stop me. To become an immortal, one must undergo countless trials, sacrifice their most precious things. But what about after becoming an immortal? The Heavenly realm decides to overturn the world to destroy the spirit towers, and kill so many lives just by using a light phrase like ‘it’s the will of Heaven’?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui said coldly, “When you decided to sacrifice your wife and child, it was your own choice! Since you made the decision, why regret it now?”</p>
<p>Duntian stopped laughing, his voice filled with an intense coldness. “And you? When you watched Mu Qingge’s soul scatter, powerless to do anything, didn’t you regret it? Didn’t you want to kill everyone on the righteous path present there for her sake? Didn’t you want to break through heaven and earth, pulling her back from the underworld?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui remained silent, but what Duntian said was indeed his state of mind twenty years ago when he witnessed that tragic scene.</p>
<p>Although he had never met Duntian, this powerful being who fell into darkness could accurately express his thoughts from back then. Was it pure coincidence, or…</p>
<p>At this moment, however, Ranran spoke with unwavering conviction, “He won’t!”</p>
<p>“Oh? Why are you so sure? Do you really understand this man? He’s like that Demon King, both chosen demonic sons of destiny, destined to plunge the world into chaos and suffering!”</p>
<p>Facing Duntian’s questioning, Ranran spoke earnestly, “He won’t, because he knows that if he did those things, I wouldn’t live happily, and I wouldn’t want to continue living this way. Isn’t the reality proof enough? He didn’t do anything as insane as you did because of my death.”</p>
<p>Seemingly persuaded by her words, Duntian fell silent for a long while before saying, “Go now. This tower is about to activate, and everything in the world will be reset. I hope you don’t make choices you’ll regret…”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After saying this, a strong gust of wind swept through, lifting several people up and blowing them straight down the mountain.</p>
<p>In this sudden gust of wind, they were scattered.</p>
<p>When they have stabilized, they found themselves at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan’s body had been weak for a while, compounded by severe morning sickness recently, causing her footing to be unsteady, almost crashing into a tree just now.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Wei Jiu grabbed her arm, and steadied her.</p>
<p>“Be careful…” Wei Jiu said.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Tu Jiuyuan couldn’t help but look at him, her eyes seemingly trembling with something. But Wei Jiu’s next words shattered her heart: “When this matter is settled, find a reliable clinic and abort the child… Once you give birth to a mortal, you’ll have no chance of ascending to heaven!”</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan took a sharp breath, silently withdrew her arm, and lowered her eyes. “The child in my belly… has nothing to do with Your Excellency. I will take good care of it. Please don’t worry Excellency…”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu was accustomed to Tu Jiuyuan’s absolute obedience. Now, hearing her veiled words, he was immediately enraged. However, before he could glare, Tu Jiuyuan clutched her stomach and collapsed weakly, appearing exhausted.</p>
<p>With Wei Jiu’s temperament, facing insubordination from subordinates, there was never much talk, only decisive action. But now, looking at Tu Jiuyuan’s pale face, he recalled the strange sensation when he thought Tu Jiuyuan had died in the inn…</p>
<p>And so he stilled his whip that was about to strike out. He thought: once this matter is settled, he could settle the score with her slowly.</p>
<p>At this moment, other people blown down from the mountain also steadied themselves.</p>
<p>The Dragon goddess’s injury from the bone tower’s barbs continued to bleed, which would incur the loss of divine power. It needed to be stopped immediately.</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal was anxious and tried to remove the bone spines for her healing. However, the goddess evaded, coldly saying, “No need, Ranran will help to treat me.”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui from Xishan had excellent medical skills, and Xue Ranran, as his beloved disciple, naturally learned a bit. She even carried medicinal ointments for stopping bleeding.</p>
<p>So Ranran immediately took out the medicine bag from her bosom and used the tweezers inside to remove the bone spines for the Guardian.</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal felt a chill after hitting this cold wall. At this moment, he somewhat understood Duntian’s feelings. The desire to turn back time, to correct mistakes, was indeed agonizing.</p>
<p>But now, Fengmou refused to forgive him, so he could only stand silently aside, watching Ranran skillfully remove the bone spines and apply the ointment to stop the bleeding for Fengmou…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The night grew darker, approaching midnight, with only the True Fire from the Medicine Immortal illuminating them. The oppressive force from above grew stronger, making it hard to breathe.</p>
<p>They knew that if they didn’t figure out a way to topple the Heaven-Defying Tower, they would have to retreat.</p>
<p>The Divine Punishment would arrive as scheduled at midnight tomorrow, and within the Four Peaks, there wouldn’t be a single piece of intact land. Whether mortal or divine, if they stayed here, they would be dragged into the abyss below, with no chance of escape.</p>
<p>At this moment, Gao Cang, Bai Baishan, as well as Wang Suizhi and Qiu Xier who had stayed at the inn, also rushed back to join them in the darkness.</p>
<p>According to Bai Baishan, they went to nearby government offices and villages to deliver letters, but the officials and villagers looked at them as if they were crazy.</p>
<p>Even if they spoke the truth earnestly, no one believed them. There was even a villager who was particularly aggressive, using farming tools to drive them out of the village.</p>
<p>“Now, we can only hope your letter to the Emperor arrives in time. But the Emperor is far away. Even if Su Yu believed this, he probably wouldn’t have time to evacuate so many people…” Bai Baishan’s shoes were worn with holes, he relayed these words with frustration as he took them off.</p>
<p>When Qiu Xier saw Tu Jiuyuan, she couldn’t help but cried out in fright.</p>
<p>It couldn’t be helped, when she was back at the inn, she had been frightened by the fake Tu Jiuyuan. Now, seeing her again, she couldn’t help but doubt her authenticity.</p>
<p>At this moment, faint sounds of drums came from a distance, marking midnight.</p>
<p>So Gao Cang said, “Junior sister, don’t be afraid. I’ll verify the truth for you!”</p>
<p>Saying that, he lifted the torch brought along to illuminate and came to Tu Jiuyuan.</p>
<p>Although this Elder from the Crimson Gate was weak physically, her aura remained undiminished. She glared coldly at Gao Cang.</p>
<p>Her expression resembled a dead demonic snake, but her shadow was glaringly visible, very real.</p>
<p>Obviously, this Tu Jiuyuan who had escaped from death was genuine.</p>
<p>Gao Cang looked and said to Qiu Xier, “Junior Sister, don’t be afraid. This Tu Jiuyuan has a shadow!”</p>
<p>Since it was midnight, Gao Cang enthusiastically lifted the torch again to shine it on the others.</p>
<p>Originally it was just out of boredom, trying to find amusement in hardship, but his smile froze suddenly when he shone the light on one of them.</p>
<p>That person… had no shadow beneath their feet!</p>
<p>Gao Cang stiffened his neck, slowly raised his head, and holding the torch, he stared at this person’s face, cold sweat beading on his forehead…</p>
<p>The person’s smile was as sweet as ever, “Senior brother, what’s wrong with you? You look like you’ve seen a ghost?”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran was staring innocently with her big eyes, speaking cheerfully to Gao Cang.</p>
<p>Gao Cang’s chin dripped with cold sweat, and his gaze moved back to Xue Ranran’s feet—indeed, there was nothing, no shadow!</p>
<p>“Ah… she… she’s not Ranran!” Accompanied by Gao Cang’s cry of horror, everyone’s gaze also focused on Xue Ranran.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran herself also looked down, then lifted her head in confusion, “Strange… where did my shadow go?”</p>
<p>Just then, a clear voice came from the nearby bushes, “Shifu! Be careful, there’s a snake demon impersonating me!”</p>
<p>With those words, another Xue Ranran gasping for breath emerged from the bushes.</p>
<p>Gao Cang shouted, “Stay back!” Then, he raised the torch and shone it at the feet of the newcomer —a clear shadow appeared.</p>
<p>It seemed that this newcomer was the real one. They had just been blown down the mountain by Duntian’s evil wind, and everything had been chaotic.</p>
<p>Perhaps this imposter took advantage of the chaos to slip into their midst.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Gao Cang used the torch to check everyone on a whim, otherwise, who knew what this imposter might have got up to!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Just then, the imposter seemed unwilling to give up, urgently saying, “What’s going on? I am the real Xue Ranran! My… where did my shadow go? Shifu! You have to believe that I’m the real one!”</p>
<p>Saying that, she rushed towards Su Yi Shui urgently.</p>
<p>But Su Yi Shui drew his sword, pressing it against her throat in time, “Don’t move!”</p>
<p>The real Xue Ranran looked at the imposter with disgust, shouting loudly, “Shifu, this must be the imposter that appeared after I was poisoned earlier. Quick! Cut off her head to prevent her from causing more trouble!”</p>
<p>The imposter seemed furious, her face turning red, “You shut up! You’re the fake one!”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui seemed too lazy to continue this farce, and with a twist of his wrist, he aimed his sword straight at the imposter’s neck.</p>
<p>However, the imposter seemed to perfectly mimic Xue Ranran’s skills, bouncing and evading fluidly, not falling behind at all. It seemed that killing her wouldn’t be easy.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Xue Ranran immediately drew her own mechanical staff, joining Su Yi Shui in battling the imposter.</p>
<p>Once she joined the fray, the imposter’s disadvantage became evident. In just a few rounds, her mechanical staff was knocked out of her hand. Xue Ranran swiftly shook her staff, knocking the imposter onto Su Yi Shui’s sword.</p>
<p>In the flickering torchlight, the sword pierced through the imposter’s chest, crimson blood immediately dripping down the tip of the sword, staining her pristine white clothes.</p>

<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>“Shifu… I… I’m real!” After choking out these words, the imposter collapsed, limply falling to the ground.</p>
<p>But strangely, this time the imposter’s limbs didn’t immediately turn into green smoke like the previous ones did. Instead, she laid motionless on the ground.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran was suspicious that she hadn’t died, so she bent down cautiously to check for breath and a pulse—there was no movement at all. It seemed like she was quite dead!</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui also looked uncertainly at the red blood dripping off his sword, then shifted his gaze to the body lying on the ground…</p>
<p>Just then, Xue Ranran burst into laughter, “Surprised? Wondering why this imposter didn’t turn into green smoke?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui slowly shifted his gaze to her. At this moment, the dark clouds in the sky dispersed slightly, and the moonlight spilled onto the earth. However, Xue Ranran’s shadow under the moonlight gradually disappeared.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a blurry shadow appeared under the fallen imposter…</p>
<p>Now, everyone was dumbfounded, unable to immediately understand what had happened.</p>
<p>Just then, from the distant town, the sound of drums rang out again, once, twice—clear drumbeats echoed, informing everyone that it was still midnight…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Why did the drums announce midnight again?</p>
<p>Everyone’s expressions changed slightly, and they looked at each other in confusion.</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal raised his head vigilantly to look around, only to find that where the moonlight reached, the surroundings seemed to distort slightly, like ripples spreading out. But in an instant, everything returned to normal.</p>
<p>He understood… the fierce wind just now was all an illusion! Duntian used the flying sand and rocks as cover, blowing them down the mountain, then set up a twisted mirror illusion for them!</p>
<p>The drumbeats from the village just now were obviously fake, so they hadn’t actually reached midnight!</p>
<p>In this illusion, whether people had shadows or what appearance they showed was completely controlled by the illusion’s master, Duntian!</p>
<p>Over these days, the constant appearance of imposters in front of the Xishan disciples reinforced the importance of using shadows to distinguish between real and fake.</p>
<p>This made the Xishan disciples develop a habit—no shadow meant it must be fake!</p>
<p>Relying on this point, Duntian cleverly manipulated things, hiding the real Xue Ranran’s shadow and giving the imposter a shadow, then using Su Yi Shui’s sword to kill the real girl..</p>
<p>Hearing the Medicine Immortal’s explanation, Qiu Xier screamed in despair, falling onto her junior sister in a pool of blood, frantically stuffing a pill into her mouth, “Junior sister, you have to hold on, wake up, wake up quickly!”</p>
<p>Wang Suizhi was in tears, crawling towards his master on all limbs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Su Yi Shui let go of his sword, which clattered to the ground, and ran over like a madman, pushing away the people who were crying and trying to reach her, tightly embracing the girl covered in blood in his arms.</p>
<p>However, Xue Ranran, with her eyes tightly shut, could no longer suddenly open them as before, playfully smiling at him…</p>
<p>Seeing the fake laughing arrogantly, Gao Cang and Bai Baishan were filled with grief and anger. After being forcefully pushed away by their master, they roared and pounced towards the fake.</p>
<p>The power of anger was exceptionally strong, and Gao Cang’s fierce slash immediately chopped off the fake’s head.</p>
<p>The limbs of the fake immediately turned into green smoke and dissipated in the wind, leaving only the head, still sporting a proud smile…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The people who have gathered here all had differences, different allegiances, but the only thing they had in common was their varying degrees of fondness for the young girl Xue Ranran.</p>
<p>So when they saw Ranran die, the grief of the disciples of Xishan went without saying. Even Dragon Island’s goddess and the young dragon, as well as Wen Chun Hui, showed a sorrowful expression on their faces. The Medicine Immortal, as a friend of Mu Qingge, felt unspeakable regret. Even Wei Jiu and Tu Jiu Yuan felt embittered.</p>
<p>Especially Tu Jiu Yuan, who had always been grateful for Ranran’s repeated help, and had complicated feelings towards Ranran. She never expected she wouldn’t be able to repay the favor owed to Ranran now…</p>
<p>Just then, the deep voice of Duntian came from the sky again: “How is it? How does it feel to kill your loved one with your own hands?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui slowly raised his head, his eyes seemingly possessed by something, now bloodshot and his forehead showing the runes of the Netherworld Realm’s spiritual spring again. He emphasized every word “Why did you plot against us like this?”</p>
<p>Duntian laughed desolately, “You couldn’t understand why I built the Heaven-Defying Tower right? Fate is cruel, the heavens are unfair. Clearly, it’s the thing you cherish most, but you can only watch it slip away before your eyes… How can anyone know this feeling without experiencing it? Xue Ranran was the fruit born on the Tree of Reincarnation. Her soul is inherently unstable. Even if you want to use the Tree of Reincarnation again, it’s useless. For her to live again, there’s only one way! That is for you to willingly become the blood sacrifice! Stand before the Eternal Tower, dig out your heart and sacrifice it to the tower! Then, maybe when time reverses, you’ll have a chance to save your beloved…”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The Medicine Immortal’s face changed instantly upon hearing this.</p>
<p>He finally understood Duntian’s purpose behind all these scheming!</p>
<p>While the Spirit Tower could reverse time and space, Duntian’s body had already decayed from demonic corruption. He wanted to return to the past with his current memories to make up for various regrets, but he needed a brand-new body. So he went to great lengths to obtain the unrefined bones of the Demon King which still retained his spirit, and then let Su Yi Shui, the demon’s son, voluntarily sacrifice himself, and dig out his heart to exchange for the Spirit Tower to become a living tower. While reversing time, he would also obtain his own rebirth.</p>
<p>With the heart and soul of two demon lords, Duntian could also gain a larger force to control the Tower to reverse time and return to the moment of his lifelong regret, to make a different choice.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, The Medicine Immortal hurriedly shouted to Su Yi Shui, “Don’t listen to Duntian’s madness. If you die, how can you save your loved one?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui had been keeped his head bowed all this time. When he raised his head again, tears of blood dripped down his eyes, his tone sounded unusually calm, “It doesn’t matter if I die, but she will live again, won’t she?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui’s tone was too calm, and if it weren’t for the tears of blood that made people feel uneasy, it would have made people suspicious that he wasn’t that sorrowful.</p>
<p>This was the numbness that only extremely grieving people could display.</p>
<p>Everyone in Xishan knew how deeply Su Yi Shui loved Ranran, and especially this time, Su Yi Shui had killed her with his own hands, he should have been on the verge of madness from the pain. So his calm tone made people feel extremely distressed.</p>
<p>Now thinking about it, that Duntian was hateful and terrifying. He had been delaying his action all along, waiting for Su Yi Shui to remove the effects of the Soul-Cleansing Talisman before he took action. His fear being that Su Yi Shui’s love was not enough and it would be difficult to achieve the kind of pain, to regain something precious he lost, and destroy that which he had regained once more.</p>
<p>Only by using the heart of such a pained person as a sacrifice could enough grieve and resentment be generated to support the power of the tower to reverse fate…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Just then, Su Yi Shui finally slowly let go of Ranran, gently placing her on a soft grassy area, then covering her body with a cloak. He suddenly stood up and walked towards the direction of the Heaven-Defying Tower.</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal became very anxious and shouted loudly, “Absolutely can’t let him go to sacrifice himself at the tower, quickly! Stop him!”</p>
<p>Once time is reversed, chaos will ensue, and everything will change. By then, even whether Mu Qingge will be born is uncertain, let alone talking about rebirth?</p>
<p>But now Su Yi Shui was clearly dominated by regret, completely swayed by Duntian’s temptation, and single-mindedly wanted to reverse time to give Ranran a chance to be reborn.</p>
<p>Once his sacrifice succeeded, the spirit tower would become active prematurely, and the Heavenly punishment and earth calamity might also come sooner.</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal dared not think further, could only shout to everyone to stop Su Yi Shui from climbing the tower, not allowing him to ascend the tower.</p>
<p>Before the Medicine Immortal finished speaking, everyone had already rushed up, trying to stop Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu took the lead, trying to use his whip to pull Su Yi Shui down, but when his whip was pulled up, it was repelled back.</p>
<p>It turned out that Duntian had long set up a spiritual shield behind Su Yi Shui, isolating him from everyone, allowing him to dig his heart out without distractions. Even when the Little Dragon transformed into its original form and desperately rammed into the transparent spiritual shield, it couldn’t get through.</p>
<p>In the end, everyone could only watch Su Yi Shui, step by step, slowly climb up the tower along the ladder of scattered bones, reaching the top of the tower.</p>
<p>This time, the Tower of Bones did not show any aggressive spikes, allowing Su Yi Shui to slowly ascend to the top of the high tower.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When he reached the top of the tower, he could see that the golden skull of the Demon King had already merged completely with the tower, even growing black flesh like the tower’s body, and beneath the skull was a cavity that resembled a shrine.</p>
<p>Just then, Duntian’s voice rang out again: “Don’t hesitate anymore, quickly perform the blood sacrifice. As long as you are willing to sacrifice, Xue Ranran will once again gain life… This is the knife I used when I killed the Demon King back then. Use it to dig out your heart…”</p>
<p>As he spoke, a carved dragon knife floated to Su Yi Shui’s side. Su Yi Shui, with tears of blood flowing, his eyes red, picked up the knife, and then slowly asked, “Is it only my heart that can be used for the blood sacrifice?”</p>
<p>Duntian said, “Do you still remember the marrow-cleansing pools on Tianmai Mountain? I left those pools back then, the real purpose was to select the person who could offer a blood sacrifice to the living tower. Choosing the Black Pool means voluntarily severing love and affection. Those who are willing to sever emotions, when they fall in love, they fall even harder than those who are easily sentimental! Over these years, many people have come and gone at that pool, but only you are the most suitable! Unfortunately, Mu Qingge disrupted everything back then, causing my plan to almost deviate… Don’t hesitate anymore, once you miss this chance, Xue Ranran will truly be beyond saving. From now forth, there will never be such a clear and pure woman between heaven and earth.”</p>
<p>This last sentence indeed moved the man with tears of blood slightly. Su Yi Shui closed his eyes, his chest heaving violently, then suddenly raised the knife high and fiercely stabbed towards his own chest.</p>
<p>“No! Master!”</p>
<p>“Master! Don’t!”</p>
<p>At this moment, at the foot of the mountain, the disciples of Xishan were already in an uproar. Everyone was crying and desperately trying to stop Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>But that sharp blow still fell fiercely… on the golden skull of the Demon King on the top of the tower!</p>
<p>The knife Duntian used was the one used by *Huangdi to kill the monster Kui back then, a holy knife blessed by the ancient sage to ward off evil. When this knife fell, the hard golden skull instantly shattered. The jaw of the skull made a cracking sound, as if emitting a painful howl, shaking the clouds in the sky.<br/>*<em>Classics of Mountains and Seas</em></p>
<p>And Duntian let out a thunderous angry roar, “Damn it! NO!”</p>
<p>With his roar, the bone ladder under Su Yi Shui’s feet instantly collapsed, and thorns of defense grew again on the bone tower.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as the skull of the Demon King, the soul of the tower, had already shattered, the crucial point of the tower had been struck. The black flesh covering the entire tower rapidly shriveled and dried up, revealing the original skeleton.</p>
<p>The towering bone tower that reached the heavens, instantly became unstable and shaky.</p>
<p>At this moment, Duntian finally revealed his true form, standing in mid-air, half of his face rotted and twisted, he roared in anger, “How dare you? Do you even know what you’ve done! You’ve destroyed the only chance for your beloved to be reborn!”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>“Didn’t my Shifu tell you from the beginning! His choice will never be like yours! Because he knows, I will never be willing to trample on the flesh and blood of others for a chance to survive!”</p>
<p>When everyone heard this clear voice, they turned their heads in astonishment, only to find that Xue Ranran, who had already stopped breathing and in a pool of blood, was… standing spiritedly behind them.</p>
<p>It’s just that her chest was still oozing red blood, looking extremely eerie!</p>
<p>Qiu Xier’s nerves was a bit lacking, suddenly seeing her junior sister coming back to life like a zombie, before she could think to be happy, she had rolled her eyes and fainted. Fortunately, Gao Cang caught her in time.</p>
<p>But Gao Cang also screamed together with second junior brother, and the three disciples held each other tightly.</p>
<p>Duntian couldn’t believe that Xue Ranran had actually come back to life. His eyes widened slowly, “How is this possible! You clearly died!”</p>
<p>After Xue Ranran was stabbed, the hidden Duntian, had already controlled the fake Ranran and confirmed for himself that she had no breath.</p>
<p>And Duntian didn’t need to get close to sense clearly that the motionless body had no signs of life anymore, and she had shed so much blood, which couldn’t be faked!</p>
<p>Xue Ranran sighed as she looked at her timid fellow disciples, then patted the dust off her body and with a rather obscene action, reached into her bosom… to take out a leather water bag.</p>
<p>The “blood” she had just oozed was actually from the leather bag.</p>
<p> “My cheeks are so tired from chewing to get this bag of red sugarcane juice! How is it? The bright red color can easily deceive, right? Hey, don’t stare at me with big eyes, I’m a person, not a ghost!”</p>
<p>It turns out that the “blood” from her was actually the juice of red sugarcane that she had been chewing all this while. Seeing Ranran playfully rubbing her cheeks, Qiu Xier, who had just come to, laughed as she cried, couldn’t help but wonder, “Ranran… when I touched you just now, and there was no pulse! Am… am I dreaming?”</p>
<p>After saying that, Qiu Xier pinched Gao Cang’s thigh hard, making big senior brother scream in pain, repeatedly shouting that he wasn’t dreaming.</p>
<p>Ranran gave her a playful glance, then took out the talisman stuck to her chest and raised it, saying, “This is Elder Jiu’s new creation, a sudden death talisman that can completely feign death. Although its effect only lasts for thirty minutes, it’s enough for a performance.”</p>
<p>When Elder Jiu drew this talisman for her, he solemnly told her that he had created it in order to escape from the Crimson Gate sect. But the wine they brought him was too good, he couldn’t bear to feign death, so he didn’t use it.</p>
<p>As he gifted this talisman to his little friend, it was to advise her not to be too stubborn. If she were to encounter a formidable enemy, it wouldn’t hurt to use the talisman to fake death and bide some time.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, this seemingly useless thing was put to use at this moment.</p>
<p>As for the sword that pierced through her heart, it relied on Su Yi Shui’s skills. His sword was a soft sword crafted by Zeng Yi. As long as he used his ingenuity, he could puncture the water bag hidden in her clothes, bypass Ranran’s body, and let the blade exit from behind.</p>
<p>In essence, it was a magic trick from the streets!</p>
<p>Of course, Su Yi Shui’s horrifying blood tears, were also just red sugarcane juice. At this late hour, looking horrifying enough could cover up Su Yi Shui’s somewhat lacking acting skills.</p>
<p>For a man who always had no expression, portraying the wretched sorrow of losing a loved one was quite difficult. Luckily, with sugarcane juice to back him up, he wouldn’t falter!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Still not believing it, Duntian said coldly, ‘Impossible! When did you figure out my plan?’</p>
<p>Ranran threw the bag containing sugarcane juice on the ground, then took out a handkerchief to wipe off the bright red sugarcane juice from her clothes, determined to thoroughly explain and dispel Duntian’s doubts.</p>
<p>“Actually, I’ve been wondering all along, why did you send the fake Tu Jiuyuan and Wei Jiu to our doorstep that day? If it was just to capture us alive, you didn’t seem very urgent about it. So what was the purpose of this move to alert us? It wasn’t until I saw this…”</p>
<p>With that, she took out a small box from her sleeve, which was the one she retrieved from Dragon Island.</p>
<p>After the lightning bolt from the Heavenly calamity opened the box, Ranran and Su Yi Shui looked at what was inside the box together while they were sheltering from the rain under the tree.</p>
<p>At that time, Wei Jiu thought they were engaging in some romantic action and kept grumbling.</p>
<p>Inside the box was actually a page of “paper.” It looked like paper but was not quite, with the words on it appearing and disappearing, as if they were constantly changing.</p>
<p>And when they looked at it, the paper displayed one shocking line of words: “<em>In the sixth month of the Yi Kun year, at three-quarters past the hour of Hai, Su Yi Shui kills Xue Ranran.</em>..”</p>
<p>When they saw these words, they naturally exchanged surprised glances. But just then, the words on the paper blurred again, and then it read, “<em>The Heavenly mandate revealed, the world awaits its fate.</em>..”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui immediately understood that this “paper” should be a page torn from the Heavenly Book by Mu Qingge years ago.</p>
<p>Mu Qingge had violated the celestial rules, peeked at the Heavenly Book, and saw Su Yi Shui’s destiny. That’s why later on, she boldly changed his fate chart and used her own life to give Su Yi Shui a chance to escape the fate of the demonic path.</p>
<p>However, for some unknown reason, she hid this page on Dragon Island back then. It wasn’t until Su Yi Shui and Ranran retrieved it that this paper saw the light of day again.</p>
<p>As for the recent sentence, it was obviously about something that was going to happen. Unfortunately, Su Yishui and Ranran had already seen it, so “<em>the world awaits its fate</em>” indicating there could still be changes!</p>
<p>Using just this one leaked line of information, the clever Ranran immediately worked out a plan with Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>Even though they didn’t fully understand what would happen, when Ranran was poisoned by the snake venom, and they exchanged glances, they immediately understood why Duntian had sent those two fakes to the inn.</p>
<p>Perhaps he wanted to use the fake Ranran to create confusion and cause some trouble.</p>
<p>So everything that followed went smoothly. The two of them didn’t even need to rehearse. They cooperated calmly and orchestrated everything.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui was actually a bit confused at the time and couldn’t tell the real Ranran from the fake. But even if the Ranran at that time was a fake, he wouldn’t have killed her.</p>
<p>When he manipulated his sword and saw Ranran acting according to plan, he immediately discerned the truth, and everything fell into place as they took up their different roles!</p>
<p>The Bone Tower was too powerful. Without playing some tricks to lower Duntian’s guard, they could never approach it. So this master-disciple duo came up with this plan, and it worked. They managed to smash the crucial part of the Spirit Tower.</p>
<p>Just then, as the Bone Tower kept loosening and collapsing, making thunderous noises, Duntian, after hearing Ranran’s explanation, felt immense disappointment and anger surge within him.</p>
<p>The opportunity he had waited countless years for was shattered, enough to ruin the mind of this person who had once been celestial but turned demonic.</p>
<p>He gave a loud roared was he swung his sword towards Su Yi Shui.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>With the collapse of the Bone Tower, the Heavenly punishment also automatically ceased. The originally heavy atmosphere gradually dissipated, and the abilities of the Medicine Immortal and Dragon Island’s goddess could be fully exerted.</p>
<p>So when Duntian rushed over, the two divine beings also flew to Su Yi Shui’s side to help him withstand Duntian’s divine attacks.</p>
<p>But Su Yi Shui gave a wave of his hand and said, “There’s no need for you two to assist. Its better if I settle this matter with him on my own.”</p>
<p>After hearing this, the Medicine Immortal looked at Su Yi Shui somewhat incredulously. Even if his talent was very high, he was still just a mortal. How could he contend with Duntian, who had once been celestial and now turned demonic?</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui had fought against Duntian before, so he should know how formidable Duntian’s abilities were. Moreover, with the collapse of the Bone Tower and Duntian’s increased fury, Su Yi Shui’s decision to face Duntian alone seemed like a joke no matter how you looked at it.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu, who now had hope of recapturing Red Flame Mountain, seeing that Su Yishui had asked the two divine beings to stand down, suddenly became spirited and nervously shouted, “This is not the time to be stubborn! Defeating Duntian is tied to the safety of the world, and there’s no room for error!”</p>
<p>For this righteous statement, to actually came from the mouth of the devil Wei Jiu, was quite shocking.</p>
<p>But Su Yi Shui seemed resolute, and would not change his mind. After asking the two divine beings to step back, he walked forward alone to confront Duntian.</p>
<p>The disparity in strength between the two sides was too great.</p>
<p>The next moment, Su Yi Shui was heavily thrown to the ground by Duntian’s overwhelming force.</p>
<p>Seeing his master being beaten so severely, the disciples from Xishan couldn’t help but gasp in fear. Gao Cang asked anxiously, “Junior sister, should we just watch our master being beaten without helping him?”</p>
<p>Ranran couldn’t bear to see Su Yi Shui being beaten, so she simply lowered her head and looked at the “paper” in her hand.</p>
<p>At this moment, another line of words appeared on the paper – “In the sixth month of the Yi Kun year, at four-quarters past the hour of Zi, Su Yi Shui alone kills Duntian…”</p>
<p>The hour was just a little off, and Su Yi Shui was indeed facing Duntian alone. But how could he kill Duntian, Ranran couldn’t figure it out.</p>
<p>Could there be a mistake in this page of the Heavenly Book? Or was there some lack of knowledge, and accidentally, the beginning and end of this sentence were incorrectly placed, and it actually meant “Duntian alone kills Su Yishui”?</p>

<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Ranran couldn’t be blamed for having doubts, there are indeed no signs of Su Yi Shui gaining any advantage.</p>
<p>The sage said: ‘*<em>Believe nothing unless it agrees with your own reason and common sense.’</em><br/>*尽信书，不如无书 : <em>提醒人们在读书的同时要学会独立思考</em></p>
<p>When Su Yi Shui was once again brutally thrown to the ground, Ranran couldn’t remain calm anymore. She drew her mechanism stick and wanted to jump up to fight alongside Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>But just then, Duntian suddenly spoke, ‘Hand over that page of the Heavenly Book to me, and I can spare his life!’</p>
<p>This was directed at Ranran. At this moment, after Duntian had beaten Su Yi Shui to vent his fury, his anger seemed to subside slightly, allowing him to think clearly.</p>
<p>His obsession for such a long time, how could he give up on it just because the Bone Tower collapsed? So after his anger subsided, he immediately started thinking about how to remedy the situation.</p>
<p><br/>Ranran knew that if this page of the Heavenly Book fell into Duntian’s hands, it would cause a huge disaster.</p>
<p>At this moment, Duntian sneered, “Back then, Mu Qingge had such audacity, peeking at the Heavenly Book and then hiding a page… But do you know the consequences of peeking at heavenly mandate? Why were those mobs from the three major sects able to obliterate Mu Qingge? It was merely the divine realm punishing the audacious thief through the hands of the three major sects! Now, you did not learn your lesson and still peeping at the Heavenly Book. Aren’t you afraid that divine retribution will strike you again?”</p>
<p>Ranran nodded in agreement “You make a valid point…” With that, she suddenly ignited real fire to burn the page.</p>
<p>Actually, even if Duntian hadn’t spoken, Ranran knew that possessing this page from the Heavenly Book wasn’t a good thing. Otherwise, twenty years ago, she wouldn’t have hurriedly placed it on the Dragon Island before things went awry.</p>
<p>Now that Duntian wanted to snatch the page from the Heavenly Book, it was better to burn it to avoid further complications…</p>
<p>But just as the real fire touched the page, a hand suddenly reached out from behind Ranran to grab it.</p>
<p>Ranran quickly stepped aside, narrowly avoiding the attack, only to find that the person trying to snatch the page was Wei Jiu!</p>
<p>Wei Jiu smiled, “Such a precious thing, how can we just burn it? Do you know what it means to possess it?”</p>
<p>To possess the page from the Heavenly Book meant having insight into divine secrets, to be ahead of the heavens! Wei Jiu naturally wouldn’t let Ranran destroy such a precious item. He even wanted to snatch it for himself.</p>
<p>The Dragon Youth was the first to rush forward, using his divine dragon’s tail to sweep Wei Jiu aside.</p>
<p>Ranran coldly said, “Wei Jiu, must you cause more trouble at this time?”</p>
<p>Before Wei Jiu could respond, a strong wind rushed over, and Duntian came to snatch the page from Ranran.</p>
<p>Seeing Duntian attacking Ranran, Su Yi Shui immediately rushed forward with his raised sword and shouted at the same time “Protect Ranran!”</p>
<p>The Dragon Island goddess and the Medicine Immortal immediately set up spiritual shields to block Duntian, preventing him from reaching Ranran for the time being.</p>
<p>Duntian could not be bothered to deal with these people. He simply struck with deadly force, easily slashing the goddess’s arm and sent the Medicine Immortal staggering back, unable to control his breath.</p>
<p>There was no longer any obstacle before Duntian, and he aimed his blade directly at Ranran.</p>
<p>At this moment, no one was Duntian’s match. The chilling aura emanating from him almost felt like it froze people in place, making it impossible to avoid.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But just then, another figure rushed forward and blocked Duntian’s fatal blow with a sword.</p>
<p>This person who had rushed over without any regard for his life was none other than Su Yi shui!</p>
<p>However… Su Yishui now seemed like a different person altogether, his aura was no less than Duntian’s.</p>
<p>A faint mark appeared on his forehead again, and he easily blocked Duntian’s Huangdi Blade.</p>
<p>When the mark appeared on Su Yi Shui’s forehead, his entire demeanor had changed. His blood-red eyes were filled with an incomparable evil aura, and the erupting demonic power instantly pushed Duntian back.</p>
<p>Duntian was also stunned. Although Su Yi Shui had once been the demon’s son, he had already returned the Spirit Spring, so why did he still possess such demonic power?</p>
<p>And seeing Su Yi Shui effortlessly control this sudden surge of demonic power, it seemed like he was born with such power…</p>
<p>When Su Yi Shui reached out and unleashed another surge of demonic power, Duntian couldn’t even withstand it properly. The forces from both of them clashed violently in mid-air.</p>
<p>Duntian grunted, spitting out black blood from his mouth. Su Yi Shui’s previous strike had even broken through his defensive shield, hitting his heart meridian.</p>
<p>Duntian had once been an immortal, but later turned into a demon. However, whether it was demon or immortal, they could not be easily harmed by mere mortals.</p>
<p>But Su Yi Shui’s furious blow just now clearly contained divine power, far surpassing the abilities of a cultivator like him who had not been able to form a nascent soul after such a long time.</p>
<p>Duntian finally focused and carefully examined the runes on Su Yi Shui’s forehead. At first glance, these runes seemed similar to those of the demon’s son possessed by the Spirit Spring, but upon closer inspection, they were clearly the marks of a demon immortal!</p>
<p>In the celestial realm, there were countless upper, middle, and lower immortals, but demon immortals had not appeared for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Immortals like Duntian, who had once been immortal but turned into a demon due to his extreme thoughts, he was just a decaying demon in terms of his body, not a demon immortal formed from a nascent soul.</p>
<p>“Have you… already ascended as an immortal?” Duntian’s mind raced quickly, coming to this conclusion.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui said mildly “Twenty years ago, I had already ascended as a demon immortal…”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>At the moment when he saw Mu Qingge’s soul scattered, his Dao had already been completed, allowing him to ascend as a demon immortal.</p>
<p>This was also the best ending “planned” for him by Mu Qingge.</p>
<p>The divine realm had intended to use him, a demon’s son, to experience tribulations for the mortal realm.</p>
<p>Just like King Zhou used Daji, causing chaos in the world to bear the rise and fall of the mortal realm, and ultimately dying in misery. When Mu Qingge saw the Heavenly Book back then, she was determined to sacrifice her life to change Su Yi Shui’s fate.</p>
<p>Her death was Su Yi Shui’s tribulation. After passing through this tribulation, he could smoothly ascend as a demon immortal.</p>
<p>Although Su Yi Shui publicly claimed that he had sacrificed his golden core to the Rebirth Tree for a chance at her reincarnation, in reality, he had used his own demon immortal’s nascent soul to nourish the Rebirth Tree, and captured Mu Qingge’s soul just in time.</p>
<p>A golden core’s consumption could be repaired and regenerated, but the damage to a nascent soul was irreparable!</p>
<p>In other words, he used his hard-earned Immortal status to exchange for Mu Qingge’s chance of rebirth twenty years later…</p>
<p>But by doing so, his nascent soul was considered ruined, and no matter how he cultivated again in the future, it was not likely to ascend again. It was no wonder that when the heads of other sects were waiting to welcome their ascension and tribulation, he was just relaxed and indifferent.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui had completely forgotten about this part before, but now that he had been released from the soul-cleansing talisman, he naturally remembered everything.</p>
<p>He had already become a demon immortal with a half-ruined nascent soul. With it half-ruined, he couldn’t afford to consume his primordial spirit any further. Therefore, over the years, he occasionally absorbed some spiritual energy from demonic figures like Wei Jiu to replenish his vitality and completely sealed off the other half of his nascent soul.</p>
<p>But just now, at the moment when Duntian’s Huangdi Blade was about to touch Xue Ranran, Su Yi Shui completely released the prohibition, unlocked the other half of his nascent soul that had been dormant for a long time, so the demonic immortal runes on his forehead were fully displayed, and he engaged in a life-and-death struggle with Duntian.</p>
<p>Ranran looked at Su Yi Shui’s red eyes emitting an indescribable sense of danger and oppression.</p>
<p>At this moment, she felt that her Shifu seemed to be very, very distant from her…</p>
<p>The Dragon goddess’s face had always lacked many expressions of humans, but at this moment, her complexion slightly changed: “A demonic immortal… How could the Heavenly Realm tolerate him?”</p>
<p>Ranran, hearing this, couldn’t help but lower her head and look at the page of “paper” again. The line of words on the paper had not changed, still saying “I<em>n the sixth month of the Yi Kun Year, at the midnight hour, Su Yi Shui alone killed Duntian…”</em></p>
<p>But just as she focused on reading, behind those words, there were new words faintly emerging : “<em>Su Yi Shui exhausts his nascent soul, perishing together with Duntian…</em>“</p>
<p><em>Nascent soul? Su Yishui hadn’t formed his nascent soul yet, how could it be exhausted?</em> There was no time to think about it. At the moment when she saw these words, Ranran had already leaped up and attacked Duntian again.</p>
<p>Based on past experience, the content on this page of the Heavenly Book could be changed. Since the Heavenly Book showed Su Yi Shui killing Duntian alone, then she would kill Duntian together with him to change the content of the Heavenly Book’s page!</p>
<p>As Ranran stood up, the Medicine Immortal swiftly followed. The Dragon goddess and the Dragon Youth all transformed into giant dragons, soaring towards Duntian.</p>
<p>“Shifu, you must not exhaust all your nascent soul energy!” Ranran warned Su Yi Shui loudly, then joined forces with the Medicine Immortal and the two dragons to engage Duntian in battle.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan remembered owing Ranran a favor, so when she saw this situation, she was about to step forward with her sword. But Wei Jiu pulled her back: “What? Is your stomach no longer hurting?”</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan pursed her lips and said, “I don’t want to owe anyone favors…”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu knew this subordinate of his had grown up in Crimson Gate since childhood and was quite ruthless, but she hated owing favors the most.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Wei Jiu snorted coldly, “Stay here and don’t move recklessly!”</p>
<p>As he spoke, he also drew out his long whip and rushed into the chaotic battle with Duntian along with others.</p>
<p>Soon after, Wen Chunhui and other Xishan disciples also rushed up to fight Duntian.</p>
<p>Although Duntian’s spiritual prowess was profound, dealing with a half-damaged demonic immortal was beyond his game plan. Add the Medicine Immortal, two dragons, Xue Ranran, and Wei Jiu, he had to expend a lot of energy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the collapse of the bone tower had destroyed much of his rationality. As he saw these people who were preventing him from reuniting with his wife and child, Duntian’s demonic nature grew stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>At this moment, even if he died, he would drag everyone present down with him!</p>
<p>Duntian, completely unleashing his madness, his hair flying wildly, the spiritual power enveloping him could crush bones and split flesh with just a burst.</p>
<p>Those with insufficient cultivation like Gao Cang and the others were unable to get close to them, being shaken by the residual power of these experts, falling to the ground and spitting blood.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu also struggled to withstand it. After just a few rounds, he was also shaken and repelled, collapsing on the ground. Xue Ranran, because she and Su Yi Shui practiced the same cultivation technique, were mutually dependent.</p>
<p>Since the other half of Su Yi Shui’s nascent soul was on Ranran, now that his nascent soul had awakened, it also stirred the dormant power on Ranran.</p>
<p>The two fought side by side, combining their strengths. With the assistance of the Medicine Immortal and the Dragon goddess, along with the Dragon Youth, they could match with Duntian.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after several rounds of fierce battle, the Medicine Immortal and the two dragons were also heavily injured by Duntian.</p>
<p>Duntian didn’t want to linger in the fight anymore, he just wanted to snatch the page of the Heavenly Book from Ranran.</p>
<p>After repelling the two dragons, he seized the opportunity and launched a fierce attack straight towards Xue Ranran.</p>
<p>Su Yishui pulled Ranran back in time to avoid a vital hit, but that strike just happened to cut open Ranran’s clothes pouch. The page of the Heavenly Book floated down through the opening,</p>
<p>And at this moment, a figure suddenly flashed across the ground, picked up the page of the Heavenly Book, and turned to run.</p>
<p>Ranran saw it clearly, that person was Mu Ranwu! It seemed she had been eavesdropping for a long time, knowing the benefits of that Heavenly Book and wanting to reap the rewards.</p>
<p>Just as Ranran silently exclaimed that this was bad, Duntian waved his hand with a ruthless strike, directly knocking Mu Ranwu straight to the ground.</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu was in so much pain this time that she couldn’t even scream. She fell to the ground, twitching and clawing at the ground.</p>
<p>Duntian snorted coldly; she was just a puppet for him to use. Could she still become a troublemaker?</p>
<p>At that moment, Xue Ranran quickly landed and reached out to grab the page of the Heavenly Book, but Duntian arrived soon after, once again launching a ruthless strike at Xue Ranran.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>This time, Su Yi Shui stood in front of Ranran again and took on the full blow.</p>
<p>Duntian’s strength was just too strong, and the other reinforcements had been repelled by him. Su Yi Shui knew that only by going all out and risking it all could they have a chance to defeat him.</p>
<p>Otherwise, with Duntian’s abilities and deep thoughts, another major disaster would eventually brew!</p>
<p>So this time, seeing Duntian attack again, Su Yi Shui didn’t dodge or evade at all, using his hand as a blade and directly thrusting towards Duntian.</p>
<p>And Duntian’s Huangdi Blade also plunged straight into Su Yi Shui’s chest. The blade was extremely long, but Duntian only pushed forward an inch before finding it difficult to exert any more force.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran had rushed over and grabbed the Huangdi Blade with both hands, preventing him from pushing forward. Meanwhile, Su Yi Shui had already turned his bare hand into a blade, directly thrusting into Duntian’s chest and grabbing his beating heart…</p>
<p>Being a demonic immortal with half a nascent soul was still an immortal, so he could grab and hold onto the demon Duntian’s heart. At the same time, he exerted force, pulling it out in one move.</p>
<p>Although Su Yi Shui’s chest was pierced, there was a cold smile in his tone: “I thought demons wouldn’t have heartbeat or warmth anymore. Your heart turned out to still seem human…”</p>
<p>Duntian still tightly gripped the handle of the blade, covering his chest where his heart used to be, glaring fiercely, still stubbornly trying to push the blade completely into Su Yi Shui’s chest.</p>
<p>“Even if I die! I will make you join me!” Duntian’s killing intent did not diminish at all. Just one more inch, and the divine blade would pierce through Su Yi Shui’s chest!</p>
<p>Ranran exerted all her strength to hold onto the blade, her hands dripping with blood, yet she didn’t dare to let go.</p>
<p>She quickly came up with a plan and looked at Duntian’s eyes, suddenly speaking, “There’s an ilusion space in Tianmai Mountain, with a small cottage by a stream, and birds chirping by the window. That must be the place you’ve always wanted to go. We… will bury you there. You can hear the laughter of your child every day, and your wife’s lullabies…”</p>
<p>With that, she endured the pain and anxiety, softly singing the tune she had heard in Tianmai Mountain’s illusion.</p>
<p>Accompanied by her singing, Duntian’s sinister expression gradually relaxed. Unconsciously, his face turned towards Tianmai Mountain.</p>
<p>Kongshan faced directly towards Tianmai Mountain, the place his senior sister had chosen as their cultivation ground, offering a splendid view.</p>
<p>In the cooling dawn, he could see the lush green mountains of Tianmai Mountain stretching endlessly. He saw the cliffs he had climbed with his wife, where his child had clamored for fruits on trees, one after another, crying loudly after the sour taste overwhelmed him…</p>
<p>It was truly a beautiful place, but for hundreds of years, he had not dared to step into that illusion because he feared that the dream would be too good, and the pain after waking up would be unbearable.</p>
<p>But now, he was about to fall into a dream from which he would never awaken, his chest emptied of its heart, yet remembering the sweetest memories from that illusion, making his emptiness a little less hollow…</p>
<p>In Ranran’s gentle singing, his hand gripping the Huangdi’s Blade finally loosened, and then pointing towards the direction of Tianmai Mountain, he fell down dejectedly!</p>
<p>The great Duntian, as he took his last breath, widened his eyes, looking straight beyond the towering mountains, at the place where his illusion was hidden…</p>
<p>As Duntian fell, Ranran didn’t even have time to exhale a sigh of relief. Although the blade didn’t completely pierce his chest, for Su Yi Shui, it was still a fatal wound.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Thinking of the definite ending on that page of the Heavenly Book, where it stated that the two would perish together, Ranran forced herself not to cry and not to panic! There was no such thing as an inescapable fate!</p>
<p>Since she had changed fate once, she could change it a second time!</p>
<p>Thinking of this, she loudly asked the Dragon goddess, “Quickly, bring the blood of the Green Dragon from the tower to Su Yi Shui!”</p>
<p>When she said this, the goddess immediately understood.</p>
<p>Originally, the Bone Tower had been formed by the coagulation of the blood of the Green Dragon. This divine blood with infinite power would be of endless benefit to the severely injured Su Yi Shui, and more effective than absorbing a hundred Wei Jius.</p>
<p>So the dragon goddess once again soared into the sky, circling around the ruins of the tower. As a dragon god, she could command all dragons effortlessly, so she easily drew out the dragon blood attached to the tower, gathering it into a blood spring that enveloped Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>“You hold on, I’ll pull out the blade…” with the healing power of the Green Dragon’s blood to close the wound, only then Xue Ranran dared to remove the blade that had been stuck in Su Yi Shui’s chest.</p>
<p>This blade was no ordinary weapon. Once it cut, it was difficult to heal. Fortunately, the blade didn’t penetrate deeply, and thankfully, Ranran remembered about the Green Dragon’s blood.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When Su Yi Shui’s wound was finally covered by the dragon’s blood, and he managed to catch his breath, Mu Ranwu crawled over in pain “Sister… save me! Quick, use the Green Dragon’s blood to save me!”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran passed by her without even looking at her.</p>
<p>For this so-called “sister” from her past life, Xue Ranran had done her utmost.</p>
<p>In this life, she had never felt any sisterly bond with Mu Ranwu, and *the poisonous needles she had shot out earlier had erased any remaining trace of sympathy from Ranran.<br/><em>*did the author get confused again? But Mu Ranwu probably created a fake of herself willingly in order to harm her sister</em></p>
<p>The *wolf from Zhongshan was beyond redemption. Learning the lesson once was enough!<br/>中山狼: 比喻忘恩负义恩将仇报的人<em> describing ungrateful people</em></p>
<p>However, Mu Ranwu was provoked by Xue Ranran’s current indifference. “You are my sister! How can you ignore me! Haven’t you forgotten our parents’ instructions? I am your responsibility, the responsibility you can’t shirk from!”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran looked at the heavily injured Mu Ranwu, and said mildly, “But… I am no longer your sister, am I?”</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu was stung by the coldness in Ranran’s eyes. She finally realized that this girl who is friendly to everyone else, harbored an unmistakable disgust towards her.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, her sister had never looked at her with such eyes!</p>
<p>At this moment, after being wounded by Duntian’s attack, she could feel her true qi dissipating rapidly, like a punctured water bag, with the little of her remaining life ebbing away.</p>
<p>“How could you say that! You’re my sister! The sister who loved me the most, who cherished me the most! How… how can you just watch me die!” Mu Ranwu coughed up blood heavily, yet still roared bitterly .</p>
<p>Xue Ranran was treating Gaocang and Bai Baishan. Hearing this, she sighed and said with sorrow, “But didn’t you kill that wonderful sister of yours with your own hands?”</p>
<p>Mu Ranwu was rendered speechless immediately—she had been the one who betrayed her sister back then, revealing her whereabouts to the three major sects, and even lured her sister into an ambush…</p>
<p>If it were Mu Qingge, no matter what she did, Mu Qingge would forgive her, and never nitpick like this! But… Mu Qingge was gone… she had been killed by her own hands.</p>
<p>When the chilling cold of death came to Mu Ranwu, the loss of blood made her hallucinate. At that time, she was still a girl with braids, crying and hungry under the eaves of a dilapidated temple, while her sister took out a hard dry bun, feeding her while softly saying, “Little sister, don’t cry. Think of this bun as freshly cooked red meat, fragrant and tender, with just the right amount of gravy!”</p>
<p>At that time, her sister was like a mother to her! But when did she lose her sister and couldn’t find her again?</p>
<p>“Sister… I want to eat the red meat you made…” When Xue Ranran stood up, Mu Ranwu choked out her final words, and took her last breath.</p>

<p>For some reason, Ranran, who could remain indifferent to Mu Ranwu’s curses, burst into tears at her nonsensical last words.</p>
<p>But she cried in uncomprehendingly, not knowing why she was shedding tears, as if there was another self living inside her, and that “her” was currently crying in sorrow for Mu Ranwu’s death…</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui had just regained some movement in his body. When he saw Ranran crying like a lost child, shedding tears looking at Mu Ranwu’s body, he struggled to sit up and pulled Ranran into his arms.</p>
<p>Although she may have no memories of her past life now, some things are engraved deep in the soul.</p>
<p>He knew how doting Mu Qingge had been to her sister, and it was precisely because of this that he remained indifferent to Mu Ranwu’s provocations time and time again. However, fate is unpredictable, and Mu Ranwu was deeply sinful and had woven her own fate.</p>
<p>All he could do now was to give Ranran a warm embrace, letting her cry freely, and completely sever all ties with her past life’s grudges and resentments!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>However, Xue Ranran still remembered one important thing. As she bent down to pick up the page of the Heavenly Book, she found that the “paper” had become scalding hot, causing her to let go all of a sudden.</p>
<p>Just then, a divine light appeared in the dense darkness of the sky, followed by a celestial fire that ignited the “paper.”</p>
<p>“The heavenly mandate are not something mortals can peek into. Have you forgotten the consequences of prying into heavenly secrets?”</p>
<p>With this reprimand, several figures appeared in the sky.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>
<p>Were you shocked by this reveal? The Medicine Immortal had been musing about the mystery of Su Yi Shui a while ago, dropping hints to us… but I was not expecting this!<em> hehe</em></p>
<p>Finally, it would seem the final boss battle is finally over… but can our heroes finally catch a break?</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">十日之期   TEN DAYS</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p><br/>Ranran followed the voice and saw several immortals who had previously supervised the *<em>Ten Thousand Calamities Divine Punishment</em>. Now, they were all surrounding a central figure with white hair and eyebrows, yet with a youthful appearance.<br/>* <em>I referred to it as Heavenly calamity otherwise its such a huge mouthful</em></p>
<p>It was this white-haired immortal who spoke.</p>
<p>In the celestial realm, immortals are also *divided into ranks. Those with relatively shallow qualifications, like the Medicine Immortal, are only lower-level immortals. However, seeing the other arrogant immortals’ deference towards the white-haired one, he must be a high-ranking upper-level immortal.<br/>*三六九<em> different ranks</em></p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal addressed him as Venerable Purple Light, said to be one of the Eight Great Upper Immortals.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Xue Ranran greeted him with folded hands, saying, “After reincarnation, Ranran in this life, does not remember past events. I hope this Upper Immortal can understand!”</p>
<p>The white-haired immortal raised his eyebrows slightly. “You cunning little girl, are you planning to use your lack of memory as an excuse to evade responsibility?”</p>
<p>Ranran’s feelings towards these immortals were quite complicated now, especially since they had all arrived only after the fact, so she felt even weirder about them.</p>
<p>So she spoke without reservation “As a mortal, I have never stood high above and overlooked the world’s affairs. Therefore, I do everything with all my might, not betraying the conscience of heaven and earth! In order to resist Duntian and prevent the masses from falling into despair, we had to use everything available to us. This is how we barely defeated Duntian and prevented widespread disaster… Perhaps if all of you had arrived earlier, we wouldn’t have needed to pry into heavenly secrets, and victory would have been assured!”</p>
<p>Ranran’s words were like hidden steel needles within cotton! Anyone with a shred of dignity would blush upon hearing them. However, the immortals high above had long ceased to be ordinary humans, upon hearing Ranran’s sarcasm, they maintained impassive expressions.</p>
<p>What Ranran said was the truth. Those upper-level immortals had initially made a convenient decision because they couldn’t destroy the Bone Tower, opting to overturn the world to prevent time from flowing backward.</p>
<p>Now that Xue Ranran and the others had risked their lives and not only destroyed the Bone Tower but also killed the demonic Duntian, the heavens should not criticize them, morally or logically.</p>
<p>Just like mortals, immortals are judged by an invisible balance in the world. Su Yi Shui and Xue Ranran’s actions had brought substantial benefits to the people and punishing them with death right now, would likely result in bad karma on those immortals who made such a decision.</p>
<p>So even though Xue Ranran had violated a major taboo by revealing heavenly secrets, the upper-level immortals had to consider their actions carefully.</p>
<p>The white-haired immortal continued, “The theft of the Heavenly Book is no small matter. Both you and Su Yi Shui are involved, and Su Yi Shui, as a demonic immortal, had used his nascent soul to intervene in the cycle of life and death without authorization, allowing someone who should have died to be reincarnated. *What’s the difference between this and what Duntian did?… Ten days later is when the gates of the celestial realm will open, and even those who haven’t transcended mortality can ascend to the heavens. At that time, you must enter the celestial realm and plead guilty before the Celestial Sovereign…”<br/>*<em>what difference was, Su Yi Shui gave something precious of his own, and did not harm anyone else doing that lol those huffy immortals are really annoying right?</em></p>
<p>Perhaps this upper-level immortal also had difficulty deciding on the severity of punishment, so he simply passed the hot potato to the *Celestial Sovereign, who oversees the upper immortals.<br/>*天尊<em> in most xianxia this is the big voice in the sky</em></p>
<p>They had already destroyed the page of the Heavenly Book and could now report back to the higher authorities. As for other heavenly punishments, they would have to wait for the Celestial Sovereign’s decision ten days later.</p>
<p>However, the Medicine Immortal had acted on his own and joined these mortals in their nonsensical actions, so the Venerable Purple Light coldly ordered the Medicine Immortal to immediately return to the celestial realm to plead his case and await punishment.</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal didn’t care much about being punished anymore. Perhaps Ranran’s merciless criticism of immortals had awakened him, and he realized he had forgotten his original intention of ascending to immortality.</p>
<p>Today, as a lower-level immortal of the celestial realm, he shouldn’t have been involved in such matters. However, the battle today was too thrilling and satisfying?</p>
<p>Furthermore, being able to fight side by side with Feng Mou again, it felt like a beautiful dream. Unfortunately, dreams always end. He glanced reluctantly at Feng Mou but was enveloped in a halo of light cast by Venerable Purple Light, ascending to the celestial realm.</p>
<p>When he looked back down at the ground, Feng Mou, who had repeatedly risked her life to protect him during the fierce battle just now, was unwilling to look at him.</p>
<p>He wanted to say something but didn’t know where to start. He could only sigh as his body gradually ascended and disappeared into the sky…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When the immortals all left, the people on the ground began to clean up the battlefield.</p>
<p>Although there were no casualties for Xishan, their injuries were severe. Gao Cang and Bai Baishan stabilized their heart meridians after taking the pills given by the Medicine Immortal, but their dantians were damaged, requiring a long period of recuperation.</p>
<p>The most frustrating thing was, despite their desperate efforts and placing their lives on the line, they were left with a deferred judgment from the celestial realm. Qiu Xier found this extremely disheartening and began cursing loudly at the sky after the immortals had left.</p>
<p>Ranran didn’t have the mood to join in cursing. She was currently using her spiritual energy to heal Su Yi Shui. His injuries were very severe, and although he could survive because of the Green dragon’s blood, he still needed quiet rest.</p>
<p>Ranran never knew that her reincarnation was actually exchanged with Su Yi Shui’s celestial status. If he had truly perished with Duntian, she definitely would not have wanted to stay alive by herself and *would follow him.<br/>*<em>but Su Yi Shui will be so mad! lol would they be two bickering ghosts?</em></p>
<p>But now that he was still alive, she could finally feel at ease. As for what would happen in ten days, she decided to take it one step at a time.</p>
<p>While everyone was recuperating, Wen Chunhui went up the mountain to inspect the houses of the Kongshan Sect. Despite Duntian falling into darkness, he wasn’t inherently bloodthirsty. The followers he had controlled were weak-willed and greedy, so most of the disciples of Kongshan Sect were imprisoned and those who had been controlled were gradually regaining their senses without fear for their lives. She instructed the injured to stay in guest rooms on the mountain until they recovered enough to leave.</p>
<p>However, Wen Chunhui politely excluded Wei Jiu and urged him to return quickly to Red Flame Mountain to assess the situation.</p>
<p>The Bone Tower in Kongshan was the main tower of the Heaven-defying tower, and now that the main tower had collapsed, the other towers were likely gone as well. As the backbone of Red Flame Mountain, he must return.</p>
<p>Wen Chunhui saw through Wei Jiu’s character, he was a true despicable schemer!</p>
<p>At such a critical moment, Wei Jiu still found opportunities to scheme. Now that Duntian had been dealt with, if Wei Jiu went up the mountain, who knows what trouble he might cause at Kongshan.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu also sensed the subtle hint in Wen Chunhui’s polite words, so he laughed coldly three times and waved his sleeve, telling Tu Jiuyuan to follow him back to Red Flame Mountain.</p>
<p>He was also eager to see how much of his foundation remained and had no interest in staying here any further.</p>
<p>Even though Su Yi Shui was injured now and it was an excellent opportunity to kill him. However, with those two dragons around, he would not be likely to succeed.</p>
<p>He had always felt that his abilities were comparable to Su Yi Shui’s, but Su Yi Shui had already cultivated into an immortal with the body of the demon’s son twenty years ago!</p>
<p>Wei Jiu finally understood the vast difference between them, and this bitter taste was enough for him to ponder over for the rest of his life. So he left rather quickly, without any dragging of his feet.</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan pursed her lips and followed Wei Jiu.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>However, not long after, Tu Jiuyuan secretly returned to Kongshan by herself.</p>
<p>Ranran was leading a few disciples of Kongshan in the mountains to gather herbs when she suddenly returned. Naturally, she asked her if she had lost something.</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan, however, knelt down in front of her with a thud. “I already owe you a great debt, so I’m shamelessly asking for another favor. Please think of a way to protect my child.”</p>
<p>As the saying goes, a mother’s love knows no bounds. Wei Jiu made it clear that regardless of whose child was in her womb, she couldn’t keep it. If she returned to Red Flame Mountain with him, she would have to drink a bowl of abortion medicine.</p>
<p>But if she tried to escape, the punishment for traitors from Red Flame Mountain was bloody and brutal, and she still couldn’t escape death.</p>
<p>So after thinking it through, Tu Jiuyuan could only come to Xue Ranran and see if this clever girl could come up with a solution.</p>
<p>Ranran looked at Tu Jiuyuan’s pale face as she held her stomach and reached out to check her pulse. Despite Tu Jiuyuan’s tumultuous emotions, her fetal pulse was stable, indicating a healthy baby inside.</p>
<p>Ranran pondered for a moment before saying, “Originally, I could shelter you in Xishan, but with the celestial punishment awaiting me and my master in ten days, without knowing what will happen, I can’t offer you complete protection… Perhaps there is a place where you can seek refuge, but you need the owner’s permission. I can ask on your behalf.”</p>
<p>When Xue Ranran later brought this up with the Dragon goddess Feng Mou, Tu Jiuyuan realized that the ideal place Ranran spoke of was the legendary Dragon Island.</p>
<p>Surrounded by dragons, it was an extremely dangerous place. Even Wei Jiu, with his prowess, wouldn’t dare to venture and harm a pregnant woman there.</p>
<p>However, Ranran wasn’t sure if Feng Mou would agree, as Dragon Island was a forbidden place, unwelcome to mortals.</p>
<p>Ranran was shocked how Feng Mou immediately agreed to this, when she broached the subject with her.</p>
<p>However, Feng Mou mentioned that her help was also self-serving, it depended on whether Tu Jiuyuan would agree.</p>
<p>It turned out that the Dragon goddess had violated heavenly rules by leaving Dragon Island without permission, and punishment was inevitable. Feng Mou had previously lost five hundred years of cultivation due to divine punishment, and her appearance was also greatly affected. If she were punished again, it would be even more severe.<br/>*<em>I thought she took on the Medicine Immortal’s tribulations for him, why was this lumped together haha</em></p>
<p>So Feng Mou was willing to form good karma and help Tu Jiuyuan protect the child in her womb. When the punishment arrived, it was uncertain whether her good deed would lessen the punishment.</p>
<p>More importantly, unborn babies were pure and untouched by sin; divine punishment wouldn’t harm the pregnant woman, as the child has yet to sin in this life.</p>
<p>If Tu Jiuyuan agreed to help her as her protector in the future, she might be able to escape calamity.</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan agreed immediately. Growing up in Crimson Flame Mountain, influenced by the environment, she was ruthless in her actions but had a strong sense of loyalty. So when Feng Mou straightforwardly told her the situation, she readily agreed.</p>
<p>Regardless of where she went, she wouldn’t be able to escape Wei Jiu’s pursuit, so she might as well take a gamble. Even if something unexpected happened, she would take her child with her!</p>
<p>Feng Mou seemed to sense Ranran’s worry and added, “Don’t worry, even if I don’t survive the heavenly tribulation, since there’s no divine punishment, the little Dragon will also protect her. After she gives birth, he will send the mother and child out of Dragon Island.”</p>
<p>The Dragon she mentioned was the young dragon. Born outside Dragon Island, it hadn’t been imprinted with restrictions, so he wouldn’t incur divine punishment even if he left the island. That’s why she had brought it out of the island with her earlier.<br/><em>*LOL technical oversight</em></p>
<p>Hearing the Dragon goddess’s words, the young dragon immediately protested with howls, seemingly unhappy with its godmother’s bleak words.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After arranging everything, Ranran bid farewell to the two dragons and Tu Jiuyuan, then returned to take care of her Shifu, prepare his medicine and wait on him by the sickbed.</p>
<p>They hadn’t had a chance to be alone since Su Yi Shui regained his memories.</p>
<p>Now, after a major battle, here was a rare moment of tranquility.</p>
<p>After feeding him the medicine, with the sun yet to set, but rain started to fall again. </p>
<p>They were staying in a guest room surrounded by dense banana plants. The sound of raindrops hitting the leaves made people drowsy.</p>
<p>So after feeding him the medicine, like a tired and coquettish kitten, Ranran climbed onto the bed as well, and buried her face in Su Yi Shui’s chest.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui thought she was tired and wanted to rest, so he didn’t disturb her. He just held her, sniffing the faint fragrance on her body, and closed his eyes to rest.</p>
<p>But soon, he felt his shirt becoming damp. He raised her chin with his hand and saw tears streaming down her tender face.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” he couldn’t help asking with a furrowed brow.</p>
<p>Ranran choked out “You big fool, you actually gave up your nascent soul for me. Don’t you know that its different from a golden core? Once damaged, it’s hard to repair!”</p>
<p>Cultivators spend their lives pursuing immortal cultivation to transcend mortal life and achieve eternal life.</p>
<p>But Su Yi Shui cultivated into a true immortal with the body of the demon’s son, and yet he easily gave it up for her. Did he know what exactly he had given up?</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui wiped the tears from her face with his long fingers but found that the more he wiped, the more tears appeared. So he stopped wiping and directly used his lips to kiss away the tears on her cheeks, then lowered his head to kiss her lips, swallowing her sobs as well.</p>
<p>When the two separated, Ranran’s breathing was unsteady, and she found it was hard to work up the feelings to continue crying.</p>
<p>“I’m talking about something serious, why are you being so unserious?” She couldn’t help but try to push him away, but the man was like a rock, to heavy to be pushed away no matter how hard she tried.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui’s gaze deepened as he stared at her, as if he wanted to devour her in one gulp.</p>
<p>He asked softly, “Do you know why I was able to have a breakthrough with the demon son’s body and ascend so quickly back then?”</p>
<p>Ranran swallowed and shook her head.</p>
<p>“Back then, there were too many men milling around you, but you never looked at me. I was thinking, when could I become stronger, strong enough that you couldn’t ignore me, and your eyes would be filled with me…”</p>
<p>Ranran couldn’t help but laugh at his sincere words. Did jealousy motivate one to progress? There were plenty of jealous people in the world. Following his logic, wouldn’t everyone be able to become an immortal from the demonic path?</p>
<p>“What about now? If other men appear around me, would you become like Duntian and fall into darkness again?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui raised an eyebrow. “I can save the trouble now. Haven’t I already proposed, and your parents have agreed? Although I’ve become an immortal, I still want to follow the secular etiquette. Tomorrow, let’s return to Xishan and get married.”</p>
<p>By then, he would be her husband, and if any reckless person dared to approach her disrespectfully, he would be absolutely justified in killing them!</p>
<p><em>Huh?</em></p>
<p>Ranran had thought Su Yi Shui would be worried about the heavenly punishment and discuss countermeasures with her. But she didn’t expect him to bring up marriage out of the blue.</p>
<p><em>This…was completely unrelated!</em></p>
<p>Su Yi Shui deeply regretted his arrogance when he had lost his memory. He didn’t know how to seize the opportunity. He should have consummated the marriage when he proposed, instead of wasting so much time.</p>
<p>So he felt it was time to move the wedding forward.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran wanted to say something, but Su Yishui was afraid she would refuse, so he simply covered her mouth with his hand. “When I remembered everything, you were afraid that I only loved you from twenty years ago; after I lost my memory, I forgot all the old feelings, didn’t I still fall for you and landed into Xue Ranran’s hands again? If you make any more excuses, I will have to take you to court. Are you just toying with me and refusing to give me your heart?”</p>
<p>Ranran and he were nose to nose, and she looked at him as he questioned her coldly, while showing a fierce look as if he was afraid of being toyed with. It was just like his bad behavior back when he lost his memory!</p>
<p>In fact, in this life, Ranran had regarded Su Yi Shui as her master for the first two years since they have met. As for when it evolved into deeper affection, thinking back, it seemed to have happened when he lost his memory.</p>
<p>At that time, Su Yi Shui had none of the demeanor of being a master, and his temperament was very difficult! He was completely like the wild beast from the Fierce Beast chapter in the [Playing Classics]. But it was precisely because of this that she saw the bad temper beneath his usually aloof and perfect appearance and *couldn’t help but fall for him…</p>
<p>Ten days would fly by, and when that time came, she would face the celestial trial with him, with uncertain outcome.</p>
<p>But if she could marry him now, even if it was just ten days of sweetness, she would have no regrets in this life!</p>
<p>Thinking of this, she forcefully pushed away his hand covering her mouth and deliberately showed a flirtatious smile, teasingly lifting Su Yi Shui’s chin, looking at his handsome face with leering eyes, and couldn’t help but give him a kiss, saying, “Since you’re so eager to get married off, I’ll reluctantly accept you… A~h…”</p>
<p>She hadn’t finished her careless words yet when Su Yi Shui turned and pressed her beneath him, and for a while, they were swept away by passion under the waves of the blankets, their low laughter continuing… lessening the apprehension of facing the heavenly trial.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The next day, the group from Xishan finished their preparations and were ready to return.</p>
<p>Along the way, Ranran had some free time to quietly ponder over what Feng Mou had told her before they left.</p>
<p>Feng Mou said that the Heavenly Book was originally a wordless book set up on the Ascension Platform in the heavenly realm. The pages of the book were closed all year round and couldn’t be opened by ordinary people.</p>
<p>So how did Mu Qingge manage to enter the heavenly realm to read the wordless book and even tear out a page? It seemed to be an impossible and bizarre experience.</p>
<p>If Ranran could remember everything from her past life, perhaps she could solve the mystery. When they faced the heavenly trial, she could also handle it more calmly.</p>
<p>As for Su Yi Shui’s identity, it was indeed an awkward existence for the heavenly realm.</p>
<p>The demon’s son had been born as a tribulation for the mortal realm. If his merits were completed, there was still a possibility of ascending after exhausting his use, rewarded with a lower immortal status and slowly enduring hardships to progress up the ranks.</p>
<p>But those who became immortals with demonic bodies were already outside the hierarchies of the immortals and were not under the jurisdiction of the Heavenly Sovereign. Such a variable, and his mere existence made all immortals uneasy. And Su Yi Shui’s abandonment of his nascent soul was actually welcomed by the heavenly realm.</p>
<p>Even the Rebirth Tree Su Yi Shui had obtained back then was guided by a higher power. Whether it was done with good intentions or ulterior motives, it was up for debate.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui looked at Ranran, who was lost in thought, and said mildly, “Don’t worry, I won’t let anything happen to you.”</p>
<p>But Ranran couldn’t help but ponder everything that had happened. After experiencing a series of twists and turns, she looked at everything around her with suspicion.</p>
<p>Additionally, there was a thought that had been lingering in her mind—was it also a conspiracy that Mu Qingge managed to see that Heavenly Book?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When they returned to Xishan, Ranran’s parents were already restless from waiting.</p>
<p>During these days, there were sudden changes in the world, especially with the four black towers surrounding Xishan. Lightning and thunder even reached Xishan, making everyone feel uneasy about the situation over at Kongshan.</p>
<p>Later Ranran had used messenger birds to inform Emperor Su Yu and at the same time informed uncle master Zeng Yi who was at Xishan, to take her parents and escape first.</p>
<p>However, when Qiaolian and Carpenter Xue had heard that their daughter was in danger, they flatly refused to leave. They cried and said they couldn’t leave Ranran alone to face the danger. They insisted on staying in Xishan and waiting for Ranran to return.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Heaven didn’t let down their love for their daughter, and Ranran finally returned all in one piece.</p>
<p>Qiaolian cried tears of joy and wanted to hold her obedient daughter in her arms like a baby, then hurried to the kitchen to prepare food and let her daughter who had worked hard for several days rest and recuperate.</p>
<p>Others may not know, but her obedient daughter was a first-rate hero who saved the world!</p>
<p>At the dining table, Ranran’s bowl was filled to the brim with food picked out by her mother.</p>
<p>Of course, Su Yi Shui took advantage of the mealtime to announce two things.</p>
<p>The first thing was that he was going to step down as the Sect leader of Xishan and return Xishan to Xue Ranran, at the same time severing the master-disciple relationship with Ranran.</p>
<p>This statement stunned the cheerful diners, and Bai Baishan asked cautiously, “Master… are you going to exile yourself from the sect?”</p>
<p>Su Yishui nodded, and Gao Cang immediately looked like he was close to tears. “Master, don’t you want us anymore? Moreover, how did Junior Sister anger you? You’re actually going to leave Xishan by yourself?”</p>
<p>Ranran felt that the table was full of delicious dishes that needed to be savored, but Su Yi Shui’s cryptic behavior was making everyone lose their appetites, which was a letdown for the chickens, ducks, fish on the table.</p>
<p>She glared at Su Yi Shui and then, ignoring her own embarrassment, loudly declared, “Don’t worry, although your Master is exiling himself from the sect, he has also found a good place to settle down… um… I’m getting married!”</p>
<p>Qiaolian blinked her eyes and was the first to understand. Her daughter had finally figured things out and was going to marry Master Su!</p>
<p>In this way, giving Xishan to her daughter would be part of her dowry, but wasn’t it still circling back to Master Su? Thinking that her dowry accumulated over all these time was finally being put to good use, Qiaolian was overjoyed. She grabbed Su Yishui’s hand and started calling him her son-in-law, my son…</p>
<p>Now, everyone finally relaxed and burst into laughter.</p>
<p>However, those who had been to Kongshan still had a hint of bitterness in their smiles.</p>
<p>They had heeded Ranran’s repeated urging and didn’t reveal the fact that they would have to face heavenly punishment for prying into heaven’s mandate, to Qiaolian and her husband.</p>
<p>So now, after hearing the news that the two were about to be married, their hearts were filled with mixed feelings: ten days later, facing the heavenly trial was going to be an unknown thunderbolt.</p>
<p>But for now, they still needed to prepare wholeheartedly for the wedding of this immortal couple.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this joyous occasion couldn’t stop evil from coming to the mountain. On the second day, just as everyone was preparing the decorations, Wei Jiu had barged into the Xishan gate, aggressively questioning Su Yi Shui, “I’m asking you, where did you hide Tu Jiuyuan?”</p>

<p>To be brutally honest, while I enjoyed this novel very much, the author’s writing is not very subtle. The 伏笔 foreshadowing sometimes is done in a very clumsy way.<br/><br/>*what can I say she loves the same bad boy like Mu Qingge did hahaha <br/>Kind of sweet she didn’t dare to love the perfect guy but couldn’t resist the imperfect one?</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">堂堂正正   HONORABLE AND LEGITIMATE</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Su Yi Shui stood in front of the mountain gate, watching as Gao Cang and Bai Baishan hung red lanterns on the gate of Xishan. He gave a wave of his hand, indicating that the lanterns were slightly crooked and needed to be straightened before saying slowly, “She is not a disciple of Xishan, why have you come looking here?”</p>
<p>When disciples of the Crimson Gate Sect join the sect, they were given a poisonous bug. Usually, it’s fine, but should they betray the sect, as the sect master, Wei Jiu can naturally activate the spell and track down their whereabouts.</p>
<p>When Wei Jiu discovered that Tu Jiuyuan had quietly run away, he was livid. Considering her pregnancy and physically weak, he didn’t immediately activate the poisonous bug, hoping that Tu Jiuyuan would calm down and return on her own to admit her mistake.</p>
<p>However, after waiting for two days without any sign of her return, Wei Jiu was completely enraged. He couldn’t wait any longer and immediately activated the poisonous bug. However, to his surprise, when he activated it, there was no response at all.</p>
<p>At that moment, Wei Jiu suspected that Tu Jiuyuan had returned to seek help from those from Xishan and that they had hidden her using some clever method.</p>
<p>So he came to Xishan in a rage to search for her, not knowing what was going on when he saw Xishan being decorated with lanterns and decorations.</p>
<p>When he understood that Su Yi Shui was getting married, Wei Jiu’s heart felt even more sour than ever.</p>
<p>After hearing Su Yi Shui’s denial, he sneered, “You sure denied it so completely, hiding my woman, are you preparing to become an instant father?”</p>
<p>Ranran, who was coming down the mountain, happened to hear Wei Jiu’s sarcastic words and spoke up, “Rest assured, the child you don’t want will have someone to love and care for him. You don’t need to worry about who his godfather will be.”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu had been suppressing his anger, but now, hearing the implied meaning in Ranran’s words that Tu Jiuyuan had found a new father for her unborn child, his anger soared. Through gritted teeth, he said, “Su Yi Shui, do you think you, a half damaged demon immortal, can intimidate me? If you don’t hand over Tu Jiuyuan, after your heavenly punishment, I’ll bring people to slaughter Xishan and torture your disciples to the bone!”</p>
<p>Although he had no intentions to become a father, let alone have Tu Jiuyuan give birth to a child, the thought of Tu Jiuyuan carrying his child and being with another man made him seethe with jealousy.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Su Yishui did not want to deal with Wei Jiu, but now, hearing his blatant threat, Su Yi Shui’s eyes also turned fierce as he slowly turned towards Wei Jiu.</p>
<p>After Wei Jiu finished speaking, he realized that Su Yi Shui’s gaze was full of killing intent, and he realized that he had said something stupid.</p>
<p>By saying that, wasn’t he forcing Su Yi Shui to kill him before the Heavenly punishment?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he quickly retreated, but it was already too late. Su Yi Shui’s attack had arrived, each move ruthless and without holding back.</p>
<p>Since the battle at Kongshan, Su Yi Shui no longer deliberately sealed off his half of the demonic immortal’s nascent soul. When he made a move, even though it was just one arm attacking, his movements were as swift as a thousand-armed Guanyin.</p>
<p>In just a moment, Wei Jiu had already been hit several times, spitting out several mouthfuls of  blood.</p>
<p>“Su Yi Shui! Damn you! We had fought side by side against enemies, and yet you disregard our past friendship like this!” </p>
<p>Wei Jiu struggled to withstand his blows, immediately backing away while cursing and clinging to their past alliance.</p>
<p>But Su Yi Shui turned a deaf ear, showing no intention of stopping; he was intent on killing Wei Jiu.</p>
<p>Wei Jiu now fully understood the huge gap in power between him and Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui wasn’t in a hurry to kill him; he seemed to be playing with his prey like a cat with a mouse, and he was almost about to shatter Wei Jiu’s internal organs!</p>
<p>Helpless, while coughing up blood, Wei Jiu shouted “I was just kidding earlier! How could you take it seriously! I can even make a Soul oath, even if you’re struck by divine punishment, I will never harm your disciples at Xishan even by a hair!”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>At this moment, Ranran spoke up, “Yi Shui, we are about to be married, it’s not suitable to have bloodshed. If he’s willing to make an oath, let’s hear what he has to say!”</p>
<p>With their divine punishment looming, Ranran didn’t want Su Yi Shui to commit more killings.</p>
<p>Finally, after Wei Jiu failed miserably to get what he wanted, after he made a perfect Soul Oath as a wedding gift, he could finally get lost.</p>
<p>As he was leaving, he still wouldn’t give up, and turned to Xue Ranran to say “Where is Tu Jiuyuan really at? I could swear another Soul Oath and I guarantee that I will not harm her and her unborn child!”</p>
<p>But this time, Xue Ranran shook her head, “She just wants to raise her child well; the poisonous atmosphere at the Crimson Gate is not suitable for a child to grow up in. She has never schemed against you, and she was your thankless caretaker, doing so much dirty work for so many years without any pay. You have already taken all the advantage you possibly could. If you had an ounce of compassion, you shouldn’t have forced her to the wall like this. You never cared about her life or death. Letting go of an insignificant woman, what loss is that to you?”</p>
<p>Wei Jiu was stumped by Xue Ranran’s words. He admitted to himself that he didn’t love Tu Jiuyuan. It’s just that over the long years, he had already gotten used to her care, and only she knew all of his preferences.</p>
<p>But to grovel like this for an insignificant woman, really touched his bottom line.</p>
<p>Unable to gain any advantage here, Wei Jiu finally left with a snort.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui hugged Ranran, as they watched Wei Jiu disappear into the distance, and their West Mountain’s gate was finally peaceful again.</p>
<p>Tu Jiuyuan was on Dragon Island, shielded by the Dragon Shield, which cut off all trace of her presence in the mortal realm. Wei Jiu probably would never find Tu Jiuyuan and her child in his lifetime.</p>
<p>But Wei Jiu, who such an arrogant person, had just volunteered to swear a Soul oath for a woman he considered unimportant.</p>
<p>Moreover, after hearing that she was about to marry Su Yi Shui, he didn’t even care about being jealous, he just wanted to know Tu Jiuyuan’s whereabouts, which was quite intriguing.</p>
<p>Thinking of Wei Jiu and Su Yi Shui, both of whom had entered the Tianmai Mountain’s Black Pool, Xue Ranran couldn’t help but lament. The curse of the Black Pool, which severed love and affection, would make people experience the pain of losing their loved ones.</p>
<p>Perhaps the curse of that pool was to make people lose their loved ones when they realized their affection?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, she sighed and said, “Elder Wen of Kongshan sent a messenger pigeon, saying that they have found the illusion in the ruins of Tianmai Mountain and left Duntian’s ashes in the illusion, which kind of reunites their family…”</p>
<p>After the trial, Tianmai Mountain had collapsed, making it difficult to find the illusion. Elder Wen volunteered for this task, allowing Su Yi Shui and Ranran to make good use of the precious ten days.</p>
<p>After all, the Divine punishment was uncertain, and every single hour for this couple who had been through so much was precious.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Su Yi Shui reached out and adjusted the necklace hanging around Ranran’s neck. The pendant was a transparent glass bead, inside was the Rebirth tree nurtured on the precious xiran soil.</p>
<p>Upon closer look, the rebirth tree has grown twice as big, its crown spreading out, and its branches filling up most of the glass bead.</p>
<p>Ranran’s inherent defiency had been mostly healed thanks to the protection of the rebirth tree. Her features now carried more charm from her past life, and her once petite figure had not only grown taller but also become more womanly…</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui looked at Ranran, feeling a tightness in his throat. He held her in his arms and whispered in her ear, “Don’t think about unrelated people anymore. We’re getting married tonight. Are you ready?”</p>
<p>Although Ranran was once known as a seductive demoness who flirted with three thousand handsome youths, she knew that she was only all talk no action, just for show twenty years ago, bearing the reputation of a demoness for nothing.</p>
<p>In fact, Su Yi Shui who appeared so proper and overflowing with a sense of abstinence, seemed very experienced when he teased and was frivolous with her!</p>
<p>Especially when they were fooling around in the Kongshan guest room, even though he stopped in time, he still took alot of advantage… Those savvy moves didn’t seem like those of an inexperienced novice!</p>
<p>Thinking of his past romantic encounters, she couldn’t help suspecting that he had some untold stories with Wen Hongshan and others, so she also felt a little jealous, saying, “How should I prepare? Don’t you already know everything? You said you never had feelings for any other women… Could it be that you don’t have feelings, but just did things?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui looked at Ranran’s rare jealous expression and chuckled softly, whispering in her ear, “What have I done with anyone else? It’s just that for the past twenty years, there’s always been a foxy woman in my dreams, calling me ‘Shui’er’ and seducing me. Perhaps after so many dreams, many things became self-taught…”</p>
<p>Ranran heard this and quickly looked around, afraid that Gao Cang and others might hear it. Fortunately, Gao Cang and Bai Baishan were perceptive; Seeing the new sect master getting lovey-dovey with the former sect master, they had ran off long ago.</p>
<p>Ranran laughed and hit his chest, saying, “I’ve never heard of anyone learning that in their dreams. Was the one in your dream a fox spirit?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui smiled, his thin lips curling. “Tonight, I must take a good look to see how many fox tails she really has!”</p>
<p>Ranran’s face turned completely red this time. She was just a newly turned nineteen-year-old girl who hadn’t had many messy dreams yet. Just thinking about what he said made her feel like her face was red to the point of dripping blood.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But no matter how shy she felt, it was time for the ceremony in the evening. Su Yi Shui refused to delay even for a day, he insisted on holding the ceremony at night.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Qiao Lian was eager to marry off her daughter and had been saving up the dowry for a long while. So, although the wedding only had people from West Mountain and the ceremony was simple, it was still lively.</p>
<p>However, the wedding dress Ranran wore was not prepared by Qiaolian. Su Yi Shui opened the West Mountain’s storage room and took out a sandalwood box from inside.</p>
<p>When he opened the wooden box, Su Yi Shui took out a fiery red dress from inside.</p>
<p>The fabric of this dress was made of an unknown material, with golden threads running through the red, and the chest and hem were adorned with sparkling gems. The long skirt trailed on the ground like the tail of a fire phoenix.</p>
<p>Such a luxurious and beautiful dress, both in fabric and craftsmanship, couldn’t have been completed in just a month.</p>
<p>Ranran asked Su Yi Shui, “This… couldn’t be something you prepared twenty years ago?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui nodded, quite willing to open up about his past awkward feelings. “You liked red clothes back then, so Su Yu wanted to appeal to your taste and bought a lot of fabric to gift to you. What he picked out with his coarse taste was so really so tacky. So, I specially sought out the Crimson rainbow weave fabric, and had a skilled embroiderer spend a whole year making it…”<br/>*<em>not Su Yi Shui thinking his uncle’s taste is bad and then ordering what could only be haute couture for his master for everyday wear</em></p>
<p>Looking at the dress that was completely new, with no signs of being worn, Ranran asked, “Then why didn’t I wear it?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui didn’t speak, but his brows furrowed again.</p>
<p>Ranran suddenly understood. On the day the dress was finished, she was probably no longer in the world. Su Yi Shui, filled with remorse, locked away the dress which had arrived too late in the sandalwood box and sealed it.</p>
<p>But based on his difficult personality, twenty years ago, he only enjoyed drowning himself in vinegar and never confessed to her. If there had been a chance to give her the dress, it wouldn’t have been a pleasant message.</p>
<p>It would probably be something like: “I got this dress by chance, and this kind of vulgar flashy gems suits you well, so I’ll give it to you since its a waste to throw away…”</p>
<p>Ranran thought this and said it out loud with a smile.</p>
<p>But Su Yi Shui reached out, playing with her loose strands of hair, and said mildly, “When a man gives a woman clothes, pay no heed to what he says, deep down, he hopes to see how she would gently remove the garment.”</p>
<p>Ranran felt a bit embarrassed hearing his improper words. She hugged the dress to her chest, turned and ran out of the storage room. But soon after, she peeked back in, and said to him “So, when I wear it, will you personally help me take it off?”</p>
<p>As she said this, her cheeks were flushed, she bit her red lips softly, and her eyes were shining shyly.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui’s eyes filled with something at her words, and he swallowed involuntarily. The mark of the demonic immortal between his brows even appeared.</p>
<p>He reached out to grab the seductive little demoness, but Ranran slipped away like a fish in water, and ran away laughing.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>On their wedding day, Ranran wore the dress that had been locked in the box for twenty years. Her hair was styled high, secured with a magnificent crown adorned with gold threads and jade, set with large pearls from the East sea, just enough to suppress the extravagance of the dress.</p>
<p>She wore a thin layer of red veil on her head, her delicate hands decorated with red nail polish, gently holding the hand of her second uncle master Yu Tong, she walked gracefully towards the hall.</p>
<p>Qiu Xier stared at her fixedly, whispering in awe, “Wow, isn’t this a fairy descending to earth? Ranran, you look so beautiful!”</p>
<p>And Ranran slowly raised her head, unable to help herself from looking at the man who had waited for her for two lifetimes.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui was also wearing a red robe, with a golden crown and tied hair. Although the festive color was easy to make people appear frivolous, Su Yi Shui’s naturally aloof temperament added a hint of gravity to the red clothing.</p>
<p>He walked slowly towards her, reaching out to gently hold her hand. Although there were constant laughter and chatter around them, he still felt like he was in a dream, as if he might suddenly wake up and find that this was only a dream…</p>
<p>But the hand he held tightly grasped back, the unmistakable strength indicating that all of this was real.</p>
<p>The day he had been waiting for has finally arrived, he was to marry his little master in red!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Qiao Lian watched her daughter finally get married in good health, crying uncontrollable tears of joy. At the same time, she prepared a jar of medicinal wine for her son-in-law filled with dog kidneys, deer pen*s, with plenty of red ginseng, placing it on the bedside of the newly weds room.</p>
<p>As a mother-in-law, she was still worried about Su Yi Shui’s age and needed to add some kindling to feel more reassured.</p>
<p>She also hoped to hold her grandchildren in her lifetime. She didn’t want the couple to focus only on cultivating immortality and leave no descendants in the mortal realm.</p>
<p>Elder Jiu enjoyed such occasions with a full table of dishes to accompany his drinking. While drinking, he did not forget to hand a small brocade box to Su Yi Shui. “Here, this is what you asked me to draw… Remember to use it with control!”</p>
<p>Ranran, with the red veil covering her head, couldn’t help but half lift the veil slightly, her big eyes staring at the box. The jar of medicinal wine her mother prepared was definitely enough for one person to drink, so why did Elder Jiu bring another talisman as a wedding gift?</p>
<p>Forgive her for her temporary lack of seriousness but she couldn’t think of any legitimate use for that talisman.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui seemed to see her full of questions, smiled slightly, pulled down her veil properly with his hand, and at the same time, his lips moved slightly, as if channeling some message to her.</p>
<p>This time, Ranran abruptly lifted the veil again, staring at Su Yi Shui with wide eyes, and then slowly covered her veil again…</p>
<p>Although this wedding was not as grand as those of worldly officials, almost everyone close to Ranran attended. Even after the ceremony, Zhu Que, who had left for a long time to seek a mate, appeared with two fiery little vermilion babies in the sky above West Mountain.</p>
<p>Accompanied by a long chirping sound, the adult and two babies flew in the night sky, their scattered red feathers shimmering with golden light, like fireworks filling the sky, dazzling yet impossible to look away from.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>That night, the wedding wine that the newlyweds drank together was the Ten-Ingredient Tonic brewed by Su Yi Shui’s mother-in-law. Qiao Lian’s son-in-law did not let down such a potent good wine .</p>
<p><em>Under-aged readers, pls jump to the next Chapter</em></p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:200px"></div>
<p>By the time night fell, Ranran felt that Su Yi Shui was surprisingly serious and diligent in examining for fox tails.</p>
<p>She even felt that she hadn’t exerted this much effort even in the life-and-death battle with Duntian!</p>
<p>Exhausted, she had to surrender in the end, preparing to get out of bed, as she warned Xishan’s exiled disciple in her capacity as the Sect master “You’re being so unrestrained… never satisfied, isn’t this wilfully being overcome by thoughts of greed? It’s greatly detrimental to cultivation! A~h~!”</p>
<p>Before she could finish her words, he pulled her back onto the bed.</p>
<p>He also replied with righteous indignation. He had been starved for twenty years and if he was not  allowed to eat his fill, this would be too much of a grievous injustice!</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui now felt as if he had taken the appetizing version of the Qingxin pill made by Ranan. His appetite has been greatly increased, and it was only halfway through the feast, so the main course was not to be taken off the table!</p>
<p>And so the newlyweds’ bridal chamber remained closed for three days.</p>
<p>Ranran could only be thankful that she had practiced cultivation seriously before; fasting for three days was not a problem, or else she would have starved to death on the rumpled red sheets.</p>
<p>On the fourth day, she looked weakly at the handsome man with  long hair falling loosely beside her. At this moment, he was half-dressed, looking dangerous yet charming.</p>
<p>But in this *honeymoon phase, clearly, he was the one exerting the most effort, so why did he now still look so alert and energetic, without a trace of fatigue?<br/>*形容新婚时的欢乐</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui lay on his side, supporting his head with one hand, looking at the sleepy woman, and took out Elder Jiu’s gift box from under the pillow, and took out a golden talisman about the width of a finger.</p>
<p>Ranran opened her eyes and looked at the talisman, somewhat skeptical. She asked, “Are you sure you want to use it now?”</p>
<p>This question clearly offended the man greatly. He narrowed his eyes and said in a low voice “Are you doubting my ability?”</p>
<p>Ranran was now all too familiar with this look. She quickly pulled the covers closer and buried her face in the quilt, laughing softly.</p>
<p>“Anyway, Elder Jiu only drew just this one; it all depends on whether you have the ability or not… A~h, I’m sorry, I won’t tease you anymore!”</p>
<p>For a while, there was only playful laughter in the newlyweds’ room.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, outside the window, the delicate flowers were vibrant, refreshed by the recent rain, tapping against the window. Two little vermilion birds fluffed their feathers, jumping around the branches like two red velvet balls…</p>
<p>When the newlyweds finally stepped out of the room, there were only two days left until the ten day deadline.</p>
<p>After serving a cup of delayed tea to her parents as a newlywed bride, Ranran couldn’t even think about being shy. She asked in a hurry, “Quick, I’m so hungry. Mother, is there any leftover Five-Spice Braised Pork Elbow from the wedding day? Just give me some to fill my stomach.”</p>
<p>Qiao Lian looked at her son-in-law Su Yi Shui who was also present and couldn’t say too much, so she could only say with amused exasperation, “How many days has it been now? Even if it’s hanging in the well to keep cool, it must already be full of maggots! I’ll make you two some braised meat noodles!”</p>
<p>However, while she was cooking, she took the opportunity to sneak into the newly weds’ room and took away the jar of tonic wine.</p>
<p>This health tonic was too potent! Her daughter was delicate and fragile; she couldn’t let her body be harmed by too much nourishment!</p>
<p>The two newlyweds were inseparable and spent each day blissfully. Unfortunately, the happy times were too short; the ten-day deadline arrived in the blink of an eye, and today was the day the heaven’s gate would open and they have to meet the Celestial Sovereign.</p>
<p>According to the heavenly rules, mortals were not allowed to enter the heavenly realm.</p>
<p>Although Su Yi Shui had ascended to become an immortal with a demonic body, he had shattered his nascent soul and lost the qualification to open the heavenly gate by himself. Only when the heavenly realm actively opened the gate and led them could they pass through the gate into the heavenly realm for their trial.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When they woke up in the morning, they saw the clouds in the sky changing, first like fish scales, then quickly gathering together, layer by layer stacking up. It seemed as if an invisible giant hand was grabbing the white clouds, piling them up like mud, and quickly forming a platform. On the platform appeared a tall gate, with the sun embedded in it, radiating light so dazzling that people couldn’t look directly at it, and the end of the gate could not be seen from outside.</p>
<p>As the white cloud-formed gate took shape, stairs appeared descending from the platform, extending into the sky above West Mountain.</p>
<p>Gao Cang and the others looked up at the white cloud steps above their heads, full of astonishment and awe.</p>
<p>Ranran ignored the obvious steps prepared for them and whistled. With the whistle, a fiery figure flew to Ranran’s side, was Zhu Que who had just returned.</p>
<p>Ranran pulled Su Yi Shui onto Zhu Que. Zhu Que seemed a little intimidated by the wide-open heavenly gate, and seemed uneasy. It fluttered its body in resistance. It wasn’t until Ranran calmed it down that it relaxed, carrying the two towards the towering heavenly gate in the distance.</p>
<p>After flying for a while, they saw a beam of light, and the Purple Light Immortal appeared from the radiance, frowning at the two and saying, “You two have no etiquette. The Celestial Sovereign has decreed to lay down the guiding heavenly steps for you, yet you insist on flying over yourselves. Isn’t that being disrespectful to the Celestial Sovereign?”</p>
<p>Ranran smiled and said, “Greetings, Immortal! While these heavenly steps seem convenient, they are haphazardly laid out and may have tens of thousands of steps. Walking on them would be time-consuming and exhausting, not to mention that by doing so, it would be our admission of guilt. I may have some minor faults, but it’s nothing major. This audience with the Celestial Sovereign is to present our case, not to admit wrongdoing. Flying over ourselves not only saves the Celestial Sovereign from waiting long, but it also makes us more comfortable.”</p>
<p>Her meaning was simple, the heavenly steps were for convicted criminals to ascend. But she and her husband were going to the heavens to investigate the hidden secrets of why the Heavenly Book was leaked, which was an honorable and legitimate action.</p>
<p>Even if the heavenly steps were provided, they wouldn’t take them!</p>

<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>The Purple Light Immortal didn’t expect these two who had violated the heavenly rules to be so strong-willed. With a cold snort, he said, “If you don’t pass through the guiding heavenly steps to enter the heavenly gate, you will have to endure the pressure of the heavenly realm as you pass through. By the time you reach the Seventh Heaven, you will be slapped back to the human realm. If you don’t want to delay any longer, you’d better obediently take the heavenly steps!”</p>
<p>Ranran looked at the heavenly steps, which seemed like a straightforward path leading straight up. However, upon closer inspection, she could see that there were countless fine thorns on the steps.</p>
<p>Moreover, Su Yi Shui had mentioned that those led by the heavenly steps were great evildoers who were going to the heavenly realm for trial. Once they stepped on the heavenly steps, it was actually a path of confession of guilt guided by the heavens. With each step, the fine thorns pierced in would involuntarily make one recall their past sins. The ten thousand steps were like ten thousand tribulations. When reaching the top, one often couldn’t help but repent, shedding tears of remorse.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran felt she had done nothing wrong, so why should she go through the ordeal of repentance on the ten thousand heavenly steps? Even if she stood trial in the heavenly realm, she didn’t want to end up in tears, begging for mercy on the ground.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui thought the same way. He calmly said, “Please don’t block our path, Immortal.…”</p>
<p>As he spoke, he gave a wave of his sleeve, causing the Purple Light Immortal’s figure to sway slightly.</p>
<p>This action made the Purple Light Immortal’s face darken with anger. He was one of the Eight High Immortals in the heavenly realm, only beneath the Celestial Sovereign and the three Imperial Emperors, highly esteemed and powerful in his own right.</p>
<p>However, just now, a half-disabled demonic immortal had flicked his sleeve, and the wind from his sleeve actually made him sway slightly.</p>
<p>This unexpected turn of events made the Purple Light Immortal both surprised and furious. While he felt his dignity had been offended, he also harbored doubts — what kind of existence was this demonic immortal? With such an unconventional background, did his divine power surpass that of legitimate High immortals?</p>
<p>Just then, the Vermilion Bird carrying the two had soared all the way to the Fourth Heaven, ascending continuously with a constant long cry.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>As the “Tai Xuan” text states, the heavens have nine layers. By the time they reached the Sixth Layer, it was no longer accessible to ordinary beings.</p>
<p>Although the Vermilion Bird was a sacred divine beast, it had not reached the stage of ascension, so when it ascended towards the Seventh Layer, it began to struggled a little…</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui and Xue Ranran obviously noticed this, so when they reached the Seventh Layer, they lightly tapped the Vermilion Bird’s feathered back with their toes and leaped up, soaring straight towards the Seventh Heaven.</p>
<p>Although Su Yi Shui only had half of a nascent soul, the other half was within Xue Ranran, so each of them had half a nascent soul of a demonic immortal. They were able to withstand the force of the ascension when reaching the Seventh Heaven.</p>
<p>However, when they reached the Eighth Layer, Ranran felt a tremendous force pressing down from above, as if an invisible giant hand was stopping them from advancing.</p>
<p>Ranran’s figure became unstable, and if it weren’t for Su Yi Shui pulling her, she would have almost fallen.</p>
<p>Having watched them ascend all the way up, the Purple Light Immortal, who had been wearing a displeased expression all along, now looked slightly relieved. Standing on the Ninth Heaven, he sneered, “Mere mortals, how can you ascend on your own? If that were possible, wouldn’t those who ascend to immortality after countless tribulations become a joke? You two should know your limits and climb the heavenly steps step by step! But with the thorns on these steps grow as time passes, since you two have delayed for so long, you’ll have to endure more suffering when you finally climb up.”</p>
<p>His words were full of mockery, sounding very unpleasant to the ears.</p>
<p>Feeling Xue Ranran’s body weakening, Su Yi Shui grabbed her hand in time, and true energy continuously flowed from him, protecting her heart meridians. He also said, “The heavens breathe, just like human respiration. You must find the right rhythm of inhalation and exhalation. When the heavens exhale, you cannot go against it, but when it inhales, you can move forward.”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran understood his meaning. The heavens breathe, and when they exhale, it’s impossible to move against them, but when they inhale, there’s a chance to advance.</p>
<p>Although it sounded simple, in reality, these subtle changes were hard to perceive. It required great insight and perception to notice such nuances.</p>
<p>So the Purple Light Immortal just smiled coldly hearing this, preparing to witness the girl’s failure.</p>
<p>After listening to Su Yi Shui’s words, Xue Ranran closed her eyes. As a Wood element practitioner, she had been cultivating in the Ice Lotus Pool of Xishan, and every pore of her body had become unusually sensitive due to the constant immersion. She could keenly sense changes in the water vapor and airflow, even as a tree would. When she who had been born from the Rebirth tree, tried to feel the inhalation and exhalation of the heavens, she did so by feeling with every inch of her skin, an experience that could only be sensed but not expressed.</p>
<p>After a few tries, she really felt the subtle changes in airflow. So she stopped wasting her true vitality and tried to relax her body as much as possible, her sleeves fluttering, like a feather, drifting through the Seventh Heaven.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui did the same. The two of them followed the rhythm of the heavens, ascending step by step, soaring straight up through the Nine Heavens!</p>
<p>Behind the Purple Light Immortal, several other immortals had also arrived. They watched in astonishment as a partially disabled demonic immortal who could never ascend again, and a mere mortal arrived not by the heavenly steps but like feathers ascending to the heavens. Each and everyone of them was left dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Putting aside whether they had violated heavenly rules, even on a rare day like today when the heavenly gate was open, in the thousands of years past, no one had seen a mortal ascend so effortlessly to the heavens!</p>
<p>If everyone knew about this loophole, what would be the point of cultivation? Wouldn’t the heavenly realm be overcrowded with high, middle, and low-level immortals?</p>
<p>So when the two from Xishan finally reached the Ninth Heaven by drifting effortlessly, the gazes of the immortals towards them were quite unfriendly.</p>
<p>Even the Jade Lotus Immortal, who had been *”invited” out of their immortal cave by the Medicine Immortal, had a complex expression as she watched them.<br/>*<em>he kicked her out lol</em></p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ignoring the hostile gazes of the immortals, Xue Ranran just looked around, searching for the figure of the Medicine Immortal.</p>
<p>In this realm of the heavens, he was the only familiar person she knew, so finding him would make things easier.</p>
<p>However, as she scanned around, she didn’t see the Medicine Immortal anywhere.</p>
<p>The Purple Light Immortal seemed to have guessed who she was looking for, so he coldly said, “The Medicine Immortal, as a lower immortal, acted on his own and intervened in matters of life and death in the mortal realm. Therefore, he has been punished by the Celestial Sovereign and is confined to his immortal cave.”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran sighed softly, “So it turns out that there’s not much difference between the heavenly realm and the mortal realm. Those who took action made mistakes, but those who don’t do anything can hold themselves high and act like saints…”</p>
<p>With this statement, the faces of the immortals tightened. Actually, they had also felt that the Medicine Immortal’s punishment was a bit excessive. It was because the Purple Light Immortal had given exaggerated accusations which led to the Celestial Sovereign’s punishment of the Medicine Immortal.</p>
<p>Nobody wanted to offend the Purple Light Immortal, so naturally, they didn’t speak up. This punishment of Dun Tian was originally the responsibility of the Purple Light Immortal. Although overturning the Four Mountains would cause heavy casualties, subduing the demonic Dun Tian would also be a great achievement.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, this great opportunity had been snatched away by Su Yi Shui, that young girl, and the Medicine Immortal, which made the Purple Light Immortal very displeased.</p>
<p>Moreover, if the Medicine Immortal were to ascend the ranks based on this level of achievement, he would ascend to become a Higher immortal. Unfortunately, there could only be Eight high-level immortals in the Heavenly Court. If he ascended, someone else would have to step down.</p>
<p>So the Purple Light Immortal’s accusations were actually quite subtle. The other immortals were also cunning enough to see through it without exposing it, understanding the situation without saying it outright.</p>
<p>The Purple Light Immortal also noticed that this little girl was sharp-tongued and quick-witted. However, now that they were in the heavenly realm, the Celestial Sovereign would have his own judgment on these bold and reckless individuals. It seemed that her chance to talk her way out with her silver tongue was limited.</p>
<p>So he coldly raised his white brows and said, “You’ve wasted enough time. Please follow me to meet the Celestial Sovereign before the heavenly gate closes!”</p>
<p>With that, he and a group of immortals stepped on colorful clouds and headed forward.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui and Xue Ranran glanced at each other, then tightly held hands and followed behind him.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The Celestial Sovereign had cultivated for ten thousand years, undergone nine hundred and ninety-nine tribulations to become the beginning of all things. He had long since transcended physical form.</p>
<p>As they progressed forward, they arrived at the realm of emptiness.</p>
<p>Here, mist and water were everywhere, and only a mirror-like body of water appeared before them.</p>
<p>The immortals stood on both sides in an orderly manner, waiting with their hands down for the Celestial Sovereign’s instructions.</p>
<p>Just then, the water rippled slightly, and a voice echoed in the void, “Su Yi Shui, Xue Ranran, you two are truly rebellious troublemakers. Despite providing the heavenly steps, you refuse to ascend with it. Do the rules of the heavenly realm mean nothing to you?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui replied mildly “Rules are established by consensus and followed by the masses. This is the case with all worldly laws. Only the heavenly rules are the most elusive. Who set these rules, and who agreed to them?”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, the Purple Light Immortal’s face changed drastically, and he sternly reprimanded, “How dare you! You’re speaking to the Celestial Sovereign. He is the beginning of all things, and his words naturally set the rules!”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran looked at him strangely and said in a small voice “If ascending to the heavens wasn’t so exhausting, I would have doubted whether I had entered the palace of the mortal realm. To find that there are also bootlickers in this remote place outside of creation…”</p>
<p>The Purple Light Immortal’s face turned red with anger, but he didn’t want to argue with mere mortals, which would lower his status. So he just gave her a cold glare, preparing to see how she would end up in a while.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Su Yi Shui’s words, the Celestial Sovereign’s tone seemed calm, “You are indeed a rare case of the millennium, a demonic being ascending to immortality, truly of a rebellious nature. Heavenly rules are not established by gods or humans, nor are they my personal whims. They follow the natural order of heaven and earth. Otherwise, chaos would ensue, and both gods and humans would face calamities. You peeked at the Heavenly book, which is a fact. How could you not be punished to set an example and warn those with ill intentions?”</p>
<p>Although the Celestial Sovereign’s tone was calm, the mirror-like water surface had begun to ripple, and it seemed like the wrath of thunder was imminent.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran spoke loudly, “May I ask the Celestial Sovereign, there’s something I don’t understand. The Heavenly book is a forbidden existence in the heavenly realm, inaccessible to most. Why was I able to accidentally glimpse the heavenly mandate twenty years ago, even steal a page of the heavenly book and bring it to the mortal realm?”</p>
<p>The Celestial Sovereign seemed to pause for a moment before speaking, “Xue Ranran… or should I say Mu Qingge. Do you know that Su Yi Shui was originally the Imperial Emperor YuanYang who violated heavenly rules, and reincarnated into the mortal realm to experience tribulations? His fate chart is peculiar, and the reasons for it are not to be mentioned. He was not destined for love, but you forcefully changed his fate for him, thus creating the karmic bond between you two. When the Heavenly book suddenly appeared in the mortal realm and fell into your hands twenty years ago, it was a strange case, and the truth cannot be revealed to heaven’s eyes… So I cannot answer how the heavenly book was lost that day.”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Hearing these words, the faces of the immortals changed.</p>
<p>Within the heavenly realm, the Celestial Sovereign was the highest authority, followed by three Imperial Emperors managing the rest of the immortals.</p>
<p>Among them, the YuanYang Emperor was the supreme deity of masculinity. All male immortals ascending to heaven had to pay respects to him before joining the ranks of immortals.</p>
<p>However, they hadn’t seen this Imperial Emperor for a long time.</p>
<p>For an immortal to descend into the mortal realm to experience tribulations was akin to a high-ranking official being demoted, something none of the immortals wanted to experience. They only knew now that Su Yi Shui was actually the reincarnation of the YuanYang Emperor! Before, they only heard that the YuanYang Emperor had violated some heavenly rule, and was grounded by the Celestial Sovereign, and his cave had been sealed for a long time. These Immortals were unaware of when the YuanYang Emperor had reincarnated into the mortal realm.</p>
<p>But now, a perfectly fine and well-respected Imperial Emperor had become a half-disabled demonic immortal after experiencing mortal tribulations, with no hope of ascending to heaven again. This situation was difficult to reconcile, and the Celestial Sovereign must have been quite troubled by it?</p>
<p>Xue Ranran widened her eyes upon hearing this, then turned to look at Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>He was once an Imperial Emperor! What kind of unforgivable heavenly rule had he violated back then to be demoted to the mortal realm to endure such a tumultuous fate?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Celestial Sovereign seemed unwilling to say more and just coldly said, “Regardless, you have peeked at the heavenly book twice, and cannot escape punishment. According to heavenly rules, you will receive the punishment of the Destruction of Divine Thunder, never to be reborn again! And Su Yi Shui, for destroying your nascent soul and tampering with life and death of another to revive Mu Qingge and disrupted the cycle of reincarnation, you shall also receive this punishment. Do you two have any objections?”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Just then, a divine cloud suddenly appeared in the sky, and a clear female voice spoke, “The heavenly book had been stolen, and the reason was unclear. If this woman accidentally stumbled upon it, human nature cannot resist curiosity, and few glances can be forgiven. Why mete out such a heavy punishment?”</p>
<p>Everyone turned towards the voice and saw a woman with long hair, forehead adorned with a crescent-shaped divine light, flying on a cloud surrounded by several female immortals. Surprisingly, the Medicine Immortal, who should have been grounded, also followed behind her.</p>
<p>Seeing her, all the immortals quickly paid their respects.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran learnt that this woman was the Xuan Tian Holy Mother, who had ascended to the heavens together with the Celestial Sovereign as his immortal companion.</p>
<p>The Celestial Sovereign had cultivated to a formless existence, but it would seem that the Xuan Tian Holy Mother was unwilling to do so, and still maintained her elegant and holy human form.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the Xuan Tian Holy Mother’s arrival, the Celestial Sovereign seemed somewhat displeased and asked, “Aren’t you supposed to be cultivating on the Western Jade Mountain? Why did you suddenly return?”</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal didn’t want to trouble the Xuan Tian Holy Mother and immediately knelt down to apologize, “As a humble immortal, I dared to act rashly and wanted to plead for leniency for these two young friends from the mortal realm. That’s why I have implored the Holy Mother to come, hoping to spare them from death penalties!”</p>
<p>Hearing his words, the Celestial Sovereign coldly said, “You’ve ascended to immortality but still can’t let go of mortal affections. This is a great offense! Originally, I intended to punish you with a three-year confinement, but now it seems it must be increased. Within ten years, you are not allowed to leave your cave! If you disobey again, your immortal status will be removed by Divine Thunder and you can go to the mortal realm to cultivate again!”</p>
<p>The Celestial Sovereign grew angry, and the Medicine Immortal naturally was sincerely fearful and immediately accepted the punishment without protest.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Since the Xuan Tian Holy Mother had spoken, the Celestial Sovereign couldn’t directly refute her, so he softened his tone and said, “You’ve always stayed out of heavenly affairs, so you naturally don’t understand the intricacies. These two individuals have acted recklessly, and if they are not punished, it will not appease the grievances. It’s better for you not to interfere.”</p>
<p>However, the Xuan Tian Holy Mother remained unmoved, her tone icy as she said, “I have stayed out of heavenly affairs, due to the loss of my beloved daughter. When you and I ascended together, I was already pregnant, but ascending required me to abandon this child. I couldn’t bear to let her perish, so I brought a Bodhi tree from Yaochi, letting her inhabit it. Originally, a thousand years would have been enough for her to attain physical form and become an immortal of plants and trees. Unfortunately, the tree withered overnight, and the fruit disappeared… This Xue Ranran was also born from the fruit of a tree, and I seem to have an affinity with her. I wish to save her, and I hope the Celestial Sovereign will grant me this favor!”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran widened her eyes in astonishment. She had prepared herself to receive punishment when she ascended to heaven, but she never expected the highly esteemed Xuan Tian Holy Mother to come forward to plead for her.</p>
<p>It seemed that although the Medicine Immortal’s status in the immortal realm was not high, his connections were quite powerful!</p>
<p>The Purple Light Immortal hadn’t expected the Xuan Tian Holy Mother to personally intervene and plead for this arrogant mortal woman. Thinking that the Medicine Immortal was causing trouble behind the scenes, the Purple Light Immortal frowned again: the Medicine Immortal was indeed overstepping his bounds, showing a lack of etiquette!</p>
<p>So he spoke, “Holy Mother may not know, that Su Yi Shui is the reincarnation of the YuanYang Emperor, originally destined to rejoin the ranks of immortals after tribulations. However, due to this woman’s peeping into the heavenly mandate and altering his fate chart, he cultivated a demonic immortal body, damaged his nascent soul, and they now have a ridiculous karmic bond. Just a few days ago, they got married, and the YuanYang Emperor can never return now. They have also violated heavenly laws together. If they are not punished, how can others be convinced?”</p>
<p>After the Xuan Tian Holy Mother arrived, although she glanced at Xue Ranran several times, she never once looked at Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>But after hearing the Purple Light Immortal’s words, the Xuan Tian Holy Mother’s gaze turned to Su Yi Shui. Hmm… her beautiful eyes were beautiful, but they now shine with a fierce light, like a mother wolf protecting her cub.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran couldn’t help but use her body to shield Su Yi Shui, not allowing the Holy Mother to glare at her husband!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The Holy Mother looked at Xue Ranran protecting Su Yi Shui like a mother hen, and her gaze actually softened. She moved closer to Xue Ran Ran and comforted her, “Your cultivation foundation is excellent. I’ve heard from the Medicine Immortal that you have saved countless people, accumulating immense merit. The heavenly principles are clear, and your good deeds will not be forgotten. If you sincerely repent, the Celestial Sovereign may not punish you so severely.”</p>
<p>After listening to the Holy Mother’s words, Xue Ranran asked earnestly, “If we sincerely repent, can the Celestial Sovereign spare us from the death penalties?”</p>
<p>Perhaps to grant deference to the Holy Mother, the Celestial Sovereign spoke, “Your marital fate was not originally in either of your destinies. If you two are willing to end this karmic entanglement and never meet again, there might be a glimmer of hope. Su Yi Shui’s nascent soul is half-destroyed, and his immortal status is ruined now. But he can live hundreds of years in the mortal realm, lead an enjoyable life, and when his lifespan ends, he can re-enter the cycle of reincarnation and cultivate immortal fate again. As for Xue Ranran, you have a profound connection with immortality. You have also saved countless lives, and your blessings are not shallow. If you can overcome this emotional hurdle and separate from Su Yi Shui, you will definitely ascend to immortality and become a high-ranking immortal in the future. Are you both willing to accept this arrangement?”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran and Su Yi Shui looked at each other. They didn’t need to channel any secret messages, they understood each other’s answer from their eyes.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran turned her head slowly and said aloud, “No need. Since we cannot escape heavenly punishment, we are willing to endure it. I just want to ask, how many times will this punishment come? If we miraculously survive, will the Celestial Sovereign continue to punish us relentlessly?”</p>
<p>The Celestial Sovereign said, “No one has ever survived the Destruction of Divine Thunder. If you can withstand it once, then consider the punishment fulfilled. From then on, the past will be forgotten.”</p>
<p>The Celestial Sovereign’s meaning was simple: Either die or part ways!</p>
<p>Peeking into the heavenly books was the original sin, but what the heavenly realm seemed more concerned about was the fact that these two individuals, who were not supposed to have a marital fate, had intertwined their fates. So, even if they had to use divine thunder, they would split them apart!</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Hearing this, Xue Ranran held Su Yi Shui’s hand tightly and said clearly, “In that case, we have decided only death will part us. Please, Celestial Sovereign, deliver the punishment!”</p>
<p>When she said that, the Holy Mother’s face became extremely ghastly. She reached out to hold Xue Ranran’s hand and said, “If struck by the Destruction of Divine Thunder, your divine soul will be obliterated, and you can never enter the cycle of reincarnation again. Why did you agree so recklessly? Don’t tell me…”</p>
<p>The Holy Mother’s words stopped halfway, her expression becoming strange, and then she slowly let go of her hand, and stopped trying to persuade her.</p>
<p>Perhaps she felt that Xue Ranran was too head-strong and not worth persuading anymore.</p>
<p>The Celestial Sovereign seemed to have anticipated that these two wouldn’t give in easily. Seeing this situation, he only said coldly, “Since that’s the case, you two will have no chance to regret your choice.”</p>
<p>As soon as he finished speaking, iron chains suddenly appeared and entangled the two. These were the Heavenly Binding Iron Chains, and once bound, they couldn’t break free. Once fixed in place, thunderous lightnings appeared above their heads, resembling giant dragons, even more terrifying than the Heavenly Tribulation of Ten Thousand Calamities.</p>
<p>If struck, their divine souls and bodies would immediately be destroyed, never to be reincarnated again!</p>
<p>The Purple Light Immortal watched the Medicine Immortal’s anxious expression with a slight cold smile. Then, he clasped his hands towards the sky and said, “The Celestial Sovereign’s wisdom will rectify chaos and restore order to the heavenly realm!”</p>
<p>But as soon as he finished speaking, he saw the Xuan Tian Holy Mother glaring at him coldly, with a chilling smile on her lips.</p>
<p>The Purple Light Immortal respectfully lowered his head, but he didn’t really care in his heart. The other immortals respected her because she used to be the Celestial Sovereign’s companion. But now that the Celestial Sovereign had become formless, their so-called marital relationship was just a name without substance. The Xuan Tian Holy Mother usually lived alone by herself. Even if he offended her, so what?</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Xue Ranran and Su Yi Shui were bound together now. Tears glistened in Xue Ranran’s eyes as she said, “We just got married, and now we have to part… I’m really reluctant…”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui lowered his head and kissed away the tears at the corner of her eyes, “Trust me…”</p>
<p>Ranran nodded vigorously and then shouted loudly, “Come on!”</p>
<p>The Celestial Sovereign seemed to sigh, the sound of which was like the helplessness of a stern father facing a stubborn child. Accompanying this sigh, the thunderous Destruction of Divine Thunder, as thick as a wandering dragon, roared towards Xue Ranran’s head.</p>
<p>However, as the fearsome blow came down, it exploded just one inch above Xue Ranran’s head and abruptly stopped.</p>
<p>Beside them, the Purple Light Immortal looked on, unable to help but exclaim in astonishment, “What’s going on? How did she manage to evade the Destruction of Divine Thunder?”</p>
<p>At that moment, the Celestial Sovereign spoke up, asking, “Purple Light Immortal, why is there fetal movement in her body?”</p>
<p>The thunderous heavenly punishment does not harm new life, a basic rule that all immortals are aware of.</p>
<p>Before this, the Purple Light Immortal had reported to the Celestial Sovereign that Xue Ranran was not yet married, and although they had married within a short ten days, it was impossible for them to conceive so quickly.</p>
<p>Could it be that the Purple Light Immortal had neglected his duty and withheld information?</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">一粒新芽   A NEW SPROUT</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Hearing the Celestial Sovereign’s questioning, the Purple Light Immortal became anxious and also puzzled.</p>
<p>He had intended to punish Xue Ranran and the others earlier, but due to the gravity of the situation, he didn’t dare to act without authorization, so he allowed them ten days.</p>
<p>At that time, he had clearly used his Heavenly Eye and saw that Ranran was not with child, that could interfere with the heavenly punishment. How could she suddenly have a three-month-old pregnancy in just a few days?</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui watched as the lightning above Ranran’s head gradually faded away, and he was finally able to settle his anxious heart.</p>
<p>The heavenly rules were indeed strict, but there were ways to bypass them. When he married Ranran, Elder Jiu had given him an improved brewing talisman.</p>
<p>Elder Jiu was fond of wine, so he used the talisman to shorten the brewing time. A ten-year-old vintage could be obtained overnight.</p>
<p>And this improved talisman limited the accelerated time to within three months.</p>
<p>Of course, although the talisman provided the boost, this was also based on the man’s own ability! Su Yi Shui managed to let his wife conceive right away after marriage, which was another skill that was not easy to flaunt!</p>
<p>The heavenly might descended, formidable and irresistible, but with a child in Ranran’s belly, even the heavenly thunder had to yield.</p>
<p>When the Holy Mother grabbed Ranran’s arm earlier, she had also noticed this, so she remained silent, standing aside and waiting for the heavenly thunder to automatically avoid her.</p>
<p>Now that it was made certain that Ranran was three months pregnant, the heavenly locks naturally released, allowing her to return to the mortal realm.</p>
<p>But even though Ranran was spared the heavenly punishment due to her pregnancy, Su Yi Shui, being a man, couldn’t possibly be pregnant. He had violated the norms of the mortal world, a crime that was hard to escape from. Once Ranran was removed, Su Yi Shui would undoubtedly face the heavenly thunder’s punishment.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Just as Ranran was released from the shackles, a force suddenly pulled her away from the Immortal Execution platform, leaving Su Yi Shui bound alone.</p>
<p>In a swift move, Ranran managed to break free from that force and threw herself back onto the platform, tightly embracing Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui lowered his head, his loose black hair falling onto her cheek. He whispered softly, “Be good, it’s too dangerous here, stand further away, remember what I told you… Don’t worry about me…”</p>
<p>Ranran suppressed her tears with difficulty and took off her necklace from her neck, hanging it around Su Yi Shui, then kissed his lips.</p>
<p>She knew that once she left the Immortal Execution platform, although they were only a few yards apart, they might be separated forever.</p>
<p>She didn’t know what kind of grievances they had from their past lives, but their love in this life was so rocky, falling in love easily, but staying together was so difficult…</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui also kissed his newlywed wife fiercely. They had only been married for a few days, yet they were about to be separated. If he could, he would have torn apart the heavens and overturned the obstacles that separated them.</p>
<p>The inseparable couple clung to each other tightly, reluctant to part. Although most of the immortals present were indifferent to love and separation, they couldn’t help but be moved.</p>
<p>The Destruction of Divine Thunder, devoid of human emotions, came rolling once again towards Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>At that moment, the Holy Mother intervened with urgency, gently waving the white cloth draped over her arm to pull Xue Ranran away from the platform.</p>
<p>As Ranran was pulled away, the thunderous dragon-like lightning struck towards the Immortal Execution platform.</p>
<p>When Ranran struggled to get up and saw the thunder striking towards Su Yi Shui, she couldn’t help but scream loudly, “Shifu!”</p>
<p>Although she had married Su Yi Shui, in moments of danger, out of habit, she still called him Shifu.</p>
<p>But as soon as she finished her cry, the heavenly thunder struck, and in an instant, Su Yi Shui was enveloped in a dazzling flash of lightning…</p>
<p>When the lightning dissipated, not even a trace of clothing was left on the Immortal Execution platform.</p>
<p>The YuanYang Emperor, who had failed the tribulation upon descending to the mortal realm, had perished on the Immortal Execution platform… This scene touched all the immortals present, filling them with sorrow.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran broke free from the cloth wrapped around her and rushed back to the platform as if she had gone mad, crawling on all fours as she searched for any trace of Su Yi Shui on the ground.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, apart from some tiny fragments of glass and pieces of broken chain, there was nothing on the ground at all.</p>
<p>The man who lay beside her with picturesque features, softly kissing her cheek, seemed to have disappeared into thin air, leaving no trace behind…</p>
<p>The Holy Mother couldn’t bear to see her in such a state, so she walked up to her and tried to help her up.</p>
<p>But Xue Ranran suddenly shook off her hand, focusing on the small green shoot sprouting from the divine earth…</p>
<p>At that moment, the Celestial Sovereign spoke, “Su Yi Shui has disrupted the heavenly rules and has been punished on the spot. His previous sins are thus forgiven. Xue Ranran, the heavenly gate is about to close in a moment, hurry and leave, return to the mortal realm!”</p>
<p>After speaking, the surroundings gradually dimmed, everything became silent and still. After delivering judgment on this earthly couple, the Celestial Sovereign left.</p>
<p>The other immortals also dispersed one after another. The Purple Light Immortal had originally intended to stay and escort Xue Ranran back to the mortal realm. But the Holy Mother coldly said, “I will escort her, you can return to your abode…”</p>
<p>Since the Holy Mother commanded so, the Purple Light Immortal had to comply and left respectfully.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>On the Immortal Execution platform, only Xue Ranran remained sprawled on the ground, with the Holy Mother who watched her helplessly.</p>
<p>“Child, get up. You are also a mother now, you need to take care of yourself…” The Holy Mother spoke softly.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran didn’t speak, just with teary eyes, she turned to the Holy Mother and asked, “May I borrow a flowerpot from you, Holy Mother?”</p>
<p>The Holy Mother frowned slightly but still conjured a black-gold sand tray and handed it to Ranran, saying, “This is the pot I used to plant immortal herbs in Yao Chi back then. What do you need it for?”</p>
<p>Without a word, Ranran used her hands as a shovel, carefully transferring the tiny green shoot the size of a grain, along with the divine soil around it into the flowerpot. Then she held the pot like a treasure and said, “Thank you, Holy Mother. I will be leaving now.”</p>
<p>The Holy Mother glanced at the small shoot, suddenly understanding something. She then said thoughtfully, “Ranran, your immortal fate is deep. If you can sever emotional ties, you will surely achieve great cultivation. Do not be entangled by human emotions and stagnate. The heavenly punishment now can be an opportunity. You must understand that earthly love is fleeting, ultimately empty. If you leave this shoot in the immortal realm, I will take good care of it for you. This way, you can focus on cultivation and ascend to immortality soon…”</p>
<p>However, Xue Ranran shook her head firmly and said, “No, I made a vow with him. We will not miss each other again in this life. Thank you, Holy Mother, for pleading for me. But I am attached to the worldly life and cannot sever love to pursue enlightenment. I hereby bid farewell to the Holy Mother, we will probably never meet again…”</p>
<p>After saying this, Ranran protected the flowerpot with spiritual energy, cradling it in her arms, and walked towards the heavenly gate. Her seemingly fragile figure was resolute, never looking back at the heavenly realm that everyone yearned for.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>The Holy Mother watched her retreating figure which never looked back, and suddenly, tears flowed from her usually cold eyes.</p>
<p>Just as Ranran descended the heavenly ladder, the heavenly gate gradually closed. The Holy Mother couldn’t hold back any longer and wanted to call out to her, but the heavenly gate closed too quickly, blocking her voice.</p>
<p>As she choked up, the voice of the Celestial Sovereign sounded in her ear again, “Su nu, she is no longer our child. Why are you so persistent and unwilling to let go?”</p>
<p>The Holy Mother, upon hearing this, turned around angrily, “Why isn’t she? She is the daughter I nurtured for a thousand years, almost forming under the Bodhi tree! Our daughter was about to be born, but because that bastard YuanYang Emperor got drunk, he prematurely picked the fruit from the tree. He made such a mistake, yet he only had to face one round of tribulations in the mortal realm. My thousand years of waiting turned into nothing! What did I do wrong? Why couldn’t I keep our only daughter in the heavenly realm? She had to follow that bastard to face the tribulations in the mortal realm. But that bastard keeps entangling my daughter in the mortal realm… Is he leading her step by step, so that she would never return to the heavenly realm?”</p>
<p>The Celestial Sovereign sighed helplessly, “So, you have been trying with all your means to guide Mu Qingge into the Yao Chi illusion, and let her see the heavenly mandate in the Heavenly Book. You originally hoped she would see the grievances that would happen between her and Su Yi Shui, so that she wouldn’t care about him anymore and focus on cultivation in order to ascend to immortality. You also hoped it would be best, if she could kill her demonic disciple to achieve enlightenment and end this karmic entanglement… But unfortunately, your cleverness backfired, making things worse the more you tried to help. Instead, she modified Su Yi Shui’s fate chart for him to ascend immediately, even if it meant sacrificing herself. They were supposed to face a tribulation and return to the heavenly realm, but now they are entangled together and had to suffer the heavenly punishment…”</p>
<p>The Holy Mother stopped choking up and just said coldly, “So you knew everything. No wonder you suddenly ordered me not to go to the mortal realm in private and even took away my Heavenly Mirror for watching the mortal realm… Then why not expose me publicly, take me to the Immortal Execution platform for trial, and prove your enlightenment by killing your wife?”</p>
<p>The Celestial Sovereign remained silent for a while before saying softly, “The heavenly way is clear, there are arrangements preordained. Now you can only look on as she has no hope of ascension and have to return to the mortal realm. Isn’t this the greatest punishment for you?”</p>
<p>Hearing this, the Holy Mother’s long hair flew as she screamed into the air, “She was also once your daughter! Don’t you feel sorry for her even a little?”</p>
<p>The Celestial Sovereign fell silent again, finally turning into a halo of light that tightly wrapped around the desolate Holy Mother. “I am formless for the sake of universal love, but has my love for you ever diminished? When Su Yi Shui obtained that Transmigration Tree back then, do you think it was picked from thin air? That Transmigration Tree was the Bodhi tree by the side of Yao Chi! I moved it to the Jue Mountain and guided Su Yi Shui in a dream on the way to extend Mu Qingge’s life. That’s the last thing I could do for her as a father. But her parental connection is no longer with us. You need to learn to let go. Although their marriage destiny is not written in the Heavenly Book, now their fates charts have been messed up and are entangled and intertwined together. I am the Celestial Sovereign, but even I cannot interfere too much. Isn’t she living well in the mortal realm? Free-spirited and carefree, very much like you in the past!”</p>
<p>Wrapped in this warm light, the Holy Mother felt as if she had returned to the embrace of her lover from years ago. She gradually calmed down, asked sadly, “Is she…really doing well like this?”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this time the Celestial Sovereign couldn’t answer her.</p>
<p>He had been away from the love in the secular world for too long, and have forgotten how warmth or cold feels.</p>
<p>But those two children, when faced with life and death choices, still chose each other without hesitation, wasn’t that the best choice they believed in?</p>
<p>After the heavenly punishment, the grievances and karma of past lives were thus wiped away. <em>May she never have to regret her choice…</em></p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Time in the mortal realm passed swiftly and unknowingly. In the blink of an eye, six years had flown by.</p>
<p>The grass and trees on the Western Mountain were even more lush, and a little child wearing red, with a tall pigtail, was playing around in the woods.</p>
<p>If someone passed by and saw this scene, they would surely suspect that the ginseng in the mountains had turned into a spirit, transforming into a child to play in the woods!</p>
<p>Just then, a tiger’s roar shook the dense forest, and a huge tiger leaped out from the woods, calling out softly to the child in red.</p>
<p>The little child was so shocked that he fell sitting down on the grass, with a mournful face saying, “Bai Bai! You cheated, I clearly said fifty counts! I haven’t hidden properly, why did you look for me so quickly? It doesn’t count! It doesn’t count! Let’s start over!”</p>
<p>But before he could finish complaining, a beautiful woman appeared and lifted the little child up, saying, “I asked Bai Bai to find you. Have you finished today’s homework? Sneaking out to play while I wasn’t looking again!”</p>
<p>The child turned his head and saw that it was his mother who had come, so he stopped pouting immediately and said with a pitiful look, “Mother, just let me play a little while longer, before I go back to do my writing?”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran smiled at her son, mischievous like a monkey, her eyes round and stern, deliberately grumpy, “I don’t want to deal with you, I’ll go to your father and complain about you!”</p>
<p>The child quickly shook his chubby face and said, “No! Mother, don’t say bad things about me to Father!”</p>
<p>But his mother was not lenient at all, she head-locked her little son with her elbow and walked straight towards their residence.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>In the courtyard, various medicinal herbs were planted in the low fence. Amidst the fragrance of herbs and flowers, a dense big tree stood in the center of the courtyard like an open umbrella.</p>
<p>The naughty little child slipped out of his mother’s arms like a slippery loach, then with nimble footwork, climbed up the tree in a few steps. On the thickest branch, there was a large fruit. Perhaps to prevent it from falling prematurely due to its size, a net was carefully tied below the fruit, supported by a few poles, very secure.</p>
<p>The child climbed onto the branch and leaned his face against the big fruit, speaking in a babyish voice, “Father, I wrote a lot of big characters today, I was a little tired, so I went to play hide-and-seek with Bai Bai. Mother says she’ll spank me, you can send a dream to mother tonight, and tell her to be gentle, use her hand, don’t use the chicken feather duster. The chicken feather duster made by Grandmaster Zeng hurts when she uses it, if Shen’er gets hurt, who will water and pull weeds for you?”</p>
<p>As he spoke, the child started to feel very wronged, even sniffing and shedding tears.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran, watching her son “complain” like this, initially felt amused and annoyed, but seeing him with red eyes in the end, she also felt sad.</p>
<p>Over the past year, her son had grown up gradually, and she had taken him to play at Uncle Master Yu Tong’s house at the foot of the mountain several times.</p>
<p>After coming back, her son kept asking questions non-stop, such as why other children’s fathers below the mountain were human and not a big fruit? When his dad would come down from the fruit, he didn’t want to play hide-and-seek with Bai Bai anymore, he wanted to play with his dad, and he wanted his dad to lift him high and buy sugar cakes together in the market.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran had always been strong and optimistic in front of her son, but hearing these words, she quickly pressed her son’s little head against her, hiding her tears in the moonlight.</p>
<p>She sniffed, then forced herself to soften her voice and comforted her son, “Soon, when Shen’er grows up, your dad will naturally come down from the tree to find you…”</p>
<p>Little Shen’er felt that something was off with his mother’s voice. He half-raised his head, and saw tears in his mother’s eyes. He quickly straightened up, gently patting her back, and kissed her on the cheek, saying, “Mother, I don’t need Father, I have you, that’s enough! Don’t cry, Mother. Father is fine on the tree, you don’t have to wash his clothes and cook for him, he just needs to drink a few sips of water every few days… Be good, Mother, don’t cry.”</p>
<p>Xue Ranran looked at her son earnestly comforting her with his little face, feeling that he looked more and more like Su Yi Shui!</p>
<p>Every time she saw her son, she seemed to see her husband when he was young.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When she returned from the heavenly realm six years ago, apart from the baby in her belly, there was only the small sprout in the flower pot.</p>
<p>She transplanted this small sprout into the courtyard and then set up a mat next to it. Day and night, she almost didn’t dare to close her eyes, guarding this small sprout fearfully, afraid that something might happen to it.</p>
<p>Back then, when they discussed how to deal with the punishment from the heavenly realm, they had already made a plan. Xue Ranran could escape punishment with the baby in her womb. But Su Yi Shui had no way to avoid it, he could only bear this fatal blow.</p>
<p>And the Transmigration Tree sealed in Xue Ranran’s glass bead necklace was their last chance.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui said he was confident that when the heavenly thunder struck, he could abandon his body and move his soul onto the Transmigration Tree, so she hung the necklace containing the Rebirth Tree around Su Yi Shui’s neck.</p>
<p>However, in that instant of lightning and thunder, anything unexpected could happen. Xue Ranran was mentally prepared, but when she saw Su Yi Shui being struck by lightning and disappeared into thin air, she still lost all her strength and collapsed on the ground. She did not even know how she descended from the heavenly gate.</p>
<p>And the small sprout on the ground was her entire hope.</p>
<p>That tree was a spiritual tree and couldn’t be boosted with Elder Jiu’s talisman. It could only absorb the essence of the sun and moon bit by bit, slowly growing and sprouting.</p>
<p>Watching the sprout grow taller bit by bit every day, Xue Ranran’s heart was suspended high because she didn’t know if, at the critical moment of life and death, Su Yi Shui’s soul had managed to attach itself to this spiritual tree.</p>
<p>Would this tree she guarded day and night, turn out to be an empty tree?</p>
<p>But this tree grew much faster than ordinary trees. *The day when her baby moved in her belly, the small sprout the size of a beansprout had grown tall enough to reach her waist.<br/>*<em>might be around 20 weeks</em></p>
<p>On Xue Ranran’s delivery date, when Yutong, who helped with the birth, came out with hot water, she saw that the tree, which was already taller than a person, had actually borne a tiny little fruit!</p>
<p>When Xue Ranran carried the newborn baby to the tree, she could even feel the extremely familiar spiritual energy emanating from the fruit even without touching it.</p>
<p>At that moment, Xue Ranran finally set her heart at ease.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui’s soul had been completely captured by this Transmigration Tree. They only had to wait for the moment the fruit ripened and fell, and their family of three could finally reunite.</p>
<p>She lifted the sleeping baby to the tree and said softly, “Son, look, this small fruit is your Father.”</p>
<p>The baby yawned, struggling to open his eyes, looked at the small fruit, then entered dreamland with a smile.</p>
<p>Ranran knew that all she had to do now was wait patiently for the moment when the fruit would fall.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But six years had passed and there was no sign of the fruit falling despite it growing bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>Now, Ranran had developed a habit. Every day, after reading with her son and putting him to sleep, she would come to the tree and chat with the fruit about the events of the day.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui had never told her before how he endured the long years before the fruit of the Transmigration Tree fell.</p>
<p>But now, she could empathize, fully understanding Su Yi Shui’s feelings at that time, of the mixture of hope, anxiety, desire, and fear he must have felt.</p>
<p>She was probably not be as strong as him, only six short years had passed, but she was already feeling overwhelmed with longing and anxiety.</p>
<p>Today was no different. After educating her mischievous son, Shen’er, she sent him to the study to practice writing.</p>
<p>With nothing else to do, Ranran carried a bucket and ladle, watering the tree while sitting underneath it, chatting about her and her son’s recent daily life.</p>
<p>“Two days ago, I took Shen’er to the town at the foot of the mountain. In these two years, many young people have appeared in the town. I wonder what they have grown up on, all of them seem to be filled with vitality, and they all have thick eyebrows and big eyes. I wonder if our Shen’er will grow up to be as handsome… If you still don’t come down from the tree, I may consider taking on some young disciples in the town, teaching them and passing the time. It’s been a long time since Xishan took in new disciples…”</p>
<p>Ranran talked to herself, unaware that after she finished speaking, the branches of the tree moved slightly even though there was no wind.</p>
<p>“Oh, by the way, Su Yu’s body couldn’t hold out in the end. Wei Jiu’s method of prolonging his life was cunning but harmful, and the backlash was very severe. He probably only had a few days left. There’s fierce infighting in the court now. Zhou Feihua and her father, with the help of Qin Xuanjiu and their old comrades, have set sail from Central Land. Oh, Qin Xuanjiu came to Xishan yesterday, crying and saying he wants to return to cultivate. This is the tenth time in these six years he’s talked about resigning and cultivating immortality… It seems West Mountain will become lively soon… Wei Jiu, that demon, is also quite bored. He hasn’t been able to extract Tu Jiuyuan’s whereabouts from me over these years. He even wrote a letter asking if I needed his help to find a ready father for our child. He’s also bored since he is so free, so it’s convenient for him to come and take care of us, the single mother and orphan.”</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">三世一镜 MIRROR OF THREE LIFETIMES</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>After finishing recounting these daily trivialities, Ranran sighed slightly. She was lamenting how Tu Jiuyuan and her daughter had been living in seclusion on Dragon Island. The Dragon goddess once sent her a message, saying that Tu Jiuyuan had a daughter who looked just like her father, implying she would grow up to be a beauty. It was a pity for the exquisite and innocent girl, growing up isolated on Dragon Island due to having a heartless father….</p>
<p>However, if this sigh were to reach the ears of others, they might suspect that a woman who had been alone in bed for six years was finding the loneliness hard to bear, receiving letters from improper men and feeling a stir of youthful desires.</p>
<p>After this, Ranran gave the tree two more scoops of water, and prepared to rest in her room.</p>
<p>Nowadays, every night after putting her son to sleep, she would have trouble sleeping and sometimes will meditate under the tree all night.</p>
<p>During the day, the noise outside and her son’s laughter while playing would make her feel sleepy, so she had developed a habit of taking a nap in the afternoon.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Today was no different. After returning to her room, she took off her outer garment and lay down on the soft herb mat, half-closing her eyes.</p>
<p>As her son had said, every time she fell into a deep sleep, the man who had been absent for six years would occasionally appear in her dreams. Especially when she couldn’t sleep deeply during the day, it was hard to tell if it was a dream or reality when she was in a half-asleep state.</p>
<p>Just like right now, she had only just started to dream, she felt the door creak open and someone lifting the curtain and sitting on the bed.</p>
<p>She wanted to open her eyes but her eyelids felt very heavy, and she just couldn’t lift them. So, she could only let the person reach out and gently stroke her cheek before slowly lying down beside her…</p>
<p>Half-asleep, Ranran was tightly held by familiar arms, and she took in the scent which she had longed for six years, and felt as if she had returned to the first few days of her marriage.</p>
<p>She couldn’t help but hug the broad shoulders back, tears in the corners of her eyes, softly calling out, “Shifu…”</p>
<p>This soft murmur made the arms around her tighten even more, with an almost suffocating force, and a low sigh, “My little fruit…”</p>
<p>And then came the overwhelming, suffocating passionate kiss…</p>
<p>This kiss was too eager and real. Even in the deepest dreams, it would make one wake up breathless.</p>
<p>Anyone waking up suddenly to find a man by their side, holding them and kissing endlessly would be frightened out of their wits.</p>
<p>However, Ranran had her skills, so her first reaction wasn’t to scream for help but to immediately turn her wrist and control the five short blades hanging on the screen, to pierce through the curtain, ready to stab the lecher!</p>
<p>The five spirit-controlled short swords came fiercely, instantly reaching the man’s back.</p>
<p>But at that moment, a deep voice sounded in Ranran’s ear, “After such a long time, this is how you welcome back your husband? Your moves are so ruthless, do you want to become a widow?”</p>
<p>Accompanied by the man’s deep voice, the five short swords fell to the ground with a clatter as Ranran pushed the man off with force, and stared with wide open eyes at the intruder’s face…</p>
<p>Thick, dark eyebrows like mountains, eyes sparkling with starlight, and that straight and captivating nose, all belonged to him, whom she had revisited in her dreams countless times…</p>
<p>“You… are Su Yi Shui? Am I dreaming?”</p>
<p>The man didn’t answer, just bent down to kiss her again, their lips intertwined with longing and sweetness of reunion.</p>
<p>After a long time, he looked up, “Do you now know if you are in a dream or reality?”</p>
<p>The tingling sensation on her lips reminded her that the man in front of her was real! Her Shifu had only grown on the tree for six years, and now the fruit has ripen and fell!</p>
<p>Ranran was overjoyed and immediately hugged him, “You… how did you come down so quickly?”</p>
<p>This took Ranran by complete surprise. She had been prepared to meet him again twenty years later. If he could manage to come down before their son got married, that would have been good.</p>
<p>But to the man who had just enjoyed his drink of vinegar, there seemed to be a hidden meaning in her words, “What? Is this not the right time for me to come back? I suppose, you could be more at ease when you are taking in young disciples when you are alone. After all, there are so many young flower youths in town, just waiting to be carefully appreciated… Right, when is Wei Jiu coming to West Mountain to acknowledge kinship? I need to prepare and welcome him properly…”</p>
<p>Ranran’s daily ramblings under the tree were just idle talk, and she never thought the fruit on the tree could hear everything, and couldn’t wait to hold her accountable!</p>
<p>Now that she had been found out, she could only laugh and cry as she hugged him tightly, “…You still provoke me. Do you know how much I missed you all these years without you?”</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>How could Su Yi Shui not know? When his body was destroyed by heavenly thunder, his primordial spirit was drawn into the seedling. Although he was initially in a chaotic state of consciousness for the first few years, he could always feel a woman whispering next to his ear while holding a babbling baby.</p>
<p>At first, he couldn’t hear it clearly, but he felt that the woman’s voice was like the sound of trickling water, soothing and calming his restless emotions.</p>
<p>Later on, if he didn’t get to hear her voice daily, he would feel anxious and uneasy. Eventually, the babbling baby started to talk, always held by someone under the tree pointing at him and shouting, “Guo Guo…”</p>
<p>The gentle woman would always correct the baby, “This is your Father, look, how big and round and so cute! Quick, call Father…”</p>
<p>Then, as his consciousness gradually cleared, he began to recall the past and realized that the gentle voice belonged to his Ranran, and the babbling baby was his son whom he hadn’t seen yet.</p>
<p>Thinking of Ranran raising their child alone without him, he was more anxious than anyone else. He wished he could fall earlier, hug the woman who had insomnia tightly in his arms, and lift the jumping mischievous child high up, and kiss his little face fiercely.</p>
<p>However, his primordial spirit was tethered to the tree and he couldn’t break free even if he wanted to. He could only silently listen to her soft whispers, endure the lonely nights, and absorb the essence of the sun and moon to mature faster.</p>
<p>Finally, on this day, the big fruit finally fell, and he broke out of the shell, feeling the warmth of the sun on his skin.</p>
<p>The fragrant herbs in the garden reminded him that he had come alive again. He could walk step by step toward the familiar courtyard, push open the door, and see his beloved woman, with black hair scattered on the fragrant mat, snow-white skin and rosy lips, exactly as he had yearned for six years…</p>
<p>At that moment, he couldn’t hold back anymore, he just wanted to hold her tightly, to soothe the pain of longing.</p>
<p>As the wind gently blew, half-closing the door, it also kept the steamy scene hidden inside…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>But for Shen’ ‘er, he had only had his afternoon lessons. When he went to look for his mother in the courtyard, the big fruit on the tree was gone.</p>
<p>As he cried loudly in a panic, a tall man in wide robes and long loose flowing hair walked out of the room.</p>
<p>His master uncles Gao and Qiu, both cried tears of joy, prostrating themselves and calling him their master. It wasn’t until the tall man lifted him up high in one lift, that he vaguely realized—his father had returned!</p>
<p>Shen’er nervously pursed his lips and tentatively called out “Father…”</p>
<p>The man fiercely kissed his tender little face, then placed him on his shoulders and casually asked him, “Do you want to go down the mountain to see the lanterns?”</p>
<p>Shen’er looked for his mother, but Su Yi Shui said with a smile “Your mother is tired and needs to rest for a while. Come on, I’ll take you to make paper lanterns!”</p>
<p>As the sun set, Ranran was finally able to get up with her sore waist.</p>
<p>Tonight happened to be the night of Qixi Festival. The canals in the town were filled with lotus lanterns. Many shops also hung lanterns at night, and groups of young boys and girls in the town were laughing and playing, making the place lively.</p>
<p>Ranran walked hand in hand with Su Yi Shui on the streets, while Shen’er sat proudly on his father’s shoulders, eating sweet cakes and holding the lotus lantern his father made for him, showing off to the other children nearby, “Look, I also have a father, my father is human, not a fruit!”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the other children stared at him blankly after his boasting. They were not stupid and naturally could tell the difference between a person and a fruit. Was this child from West Mountain trying to insult them?</p>
<p>However, the couple was just too perfect. The man was tall and handsome, the woman was beautifully captivating, both exuding the aura of immortals. The child on the man’s shoulder was white and cute, they were truly enviable.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui was still the same as before, now bringing two food lovers, big and small, eating from one end of the street to the other. The streets were bustling with people, filled with the atmosphere of the worldly life.</p>
<p>When someone set off fireworks across the river, the sky was filled with brilliance, like stars.</p>
<p>Ranran hugged Su Yi Shui tightly, whispering softly “It’s worth dying to stay by your lover’s side, let’s be a pair of mandarin ducks and not envy immortals…”<br/>*得成比目何辞死，愿作鸳鸯不羡仙 <br/>比目鱼 鸳鸯 <em>are animals used by ancient poets</em></p>
<p>Su Yi Shui listened to her suddenly reciting ancient poetry and said in a deep voice, “Don’t think about life and death recklessly, I will always be by your side…”</p>
<p>Thinking back on the hardships they had faced in their relationship, almost missing each other several times being separated by life and death, the peaceful years now were precious, no curse is to be allowed.</p>
<p>Ranran smiled playfully, cuddling with her son together in Su Yi Shui’s arms. They watched the brilliant fireworks in the sky, wondering if the gods in the sky also envied mandarin ducks rather than immortals when they saw this scene.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>At that moment, the Medicine Immortal stood in the sky, looking at the riverbank adorned with lotus lanterns, especially the reunited family of three, also let out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you go down to the mortal world to light lotus lanterns this year?” Suddenly, someone behind him asked.</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal turned to look at the Qinglian Fairy standing behind him at some point, with a slight wry smile. He said lightly, “She already has a good person by her side, so I don’t need to disturb her worldly affairs anymore…”</p>
<p>In these past few years, he had hesitated several times about going to Dragon Island. It was only last year when the barrier around Dragon Island suddenly showed a crack, seeming to allow him to enter.</p>
<p>At that time, he thought that Feng Mou had finally forgiven him, naturally felt ecstatic.</p>
<p>However, what he saw when he entered was Feng Mou nestled in the arms of a tall young man.</p>
<p>The look in Feng Mou’s eyes as she looked at the young man was so familiar, filled with love. She had once looked at the Medicine Immortal with such affection as well…</p>
<p>“I called you here to let you know that everything is fine now. I hope you won’t disturb my peace anymore…” as she said this, Feng Mou’s eyes finally turned to him, but they became extremely cold.</p>
<p>At that moment, the Medicine Immortal looked at the woman standing beside the now grown-up little dragon and finally realized that his fate with Feng Mou had ended…</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal could only turn around and leave, but he didn’t see Feng Mou coldly pushing away the hands of the young dragon when he turned around, causing the young man to look at her with a flushed face and red eyes…</p>
<p>After that trip to Dragon Island, he never again released a lotus lantern.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, the Medicine Immortal didn’t want to recall memories related to the lotus lantern. The fundamental reason why he had remained a lower Immortal and couldn’t ascend the ranks was that he had always harbored guilt in his heart. Now that Feng Mou had someone to take care of her, he could focus on his cultivation.</p>
<p>However, recalling the instructions from the Xuan Tian Holy Mother, he still needed to visit the mortal realm and give something to that couple.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Three days after Su Yi Shui came down from the tree, the Medicine Immortal arrived at the Ice Lotus Pool in West Mountain.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran didn’t expect the Medicine Immortal to appear so unexpectedly and cautiously greeted him, “Is the Immortal here to take us to trial for the Heavenly Court again?”</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal smiled wryly, “Although I am a Lower Immortal, I am not in the position of the God of Misfortune, so I don’t come bearing bad news every time.”</p>
<p>Ranran immediately heaved a long sigh of relief upon hearing this. When they were punished in the heavenly trial, they had managed to avoid the death punishment by each finding a loophole.</p>
<p>Especially Su Yi Shui, after attaching to the Transmigration tree, he essentially experienced rebirth. His original nascent soul had been damaged and he couldn’t ascend again. But now, he was like a newborn who continued with his previous memories and retained his spiritual power, a fortuitous turn of events that will allow him to continue cultivating without limitations.</p>
<p>If the Celestial Sovereign disliked them and wanted to look for trouble after six years have past, disrupting their hard-won reunion as a family of three, it would be troublesome again.</p>
<p>When the Medicine Immortal handed her a small box, Ranran blinked in confusion and asked tentatively, “What is this?”</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal said, “It’s the Three Lives Mirror from the immortal realm, capable of peering into a person’s three lifetimes. The Holy Mother knows that Su Yi Shui has come down from the reincarnation tree, so she sent this, hoping that you two can understand your past lives and achieve enlightenment, breaking free from the entanglements of emotions and ascend to immortality soon…”</p>
<p>Although the Celestial Sovereign advised the Holy Mother that their familial fate had ended, and it shouldn’t be forced, she was still persistent. That’s why she sought out the Three Lives Mirror and had the Medicine Immortal deliver it.</p>
<p>The word “emotion” was a difficult obstacle for most cultivators. To pass or not to pass, it was a matter of great importance.</p>
<p>Consider Dun Tian, originally talented enough to ascend directly to the ranks of Higher Immortals, but because he couldn’t let go, he gradually went astray and ended up with a tragic end.</p>
<p>The Holy Mother didn’t want Ranran to follow the same path, so she sent the mirror, hoping she could understand the beginning of the karmic entanglement between her and Su Yi Shui.</p>
<p>If they understood it, they could let it go.</p>
<p>But Ranran, after hearing this, exchanged a glance with Su Yi Shui and pushed the wooden box aside, politely saying, “This kind of immortal treasure, please let the Holy Mother keep it for herself. I can’t even remember my past life, let alone three lifetimes. Although there is karma from past lives in the world, we don’t need to know everything in detail. Otherwise, what’s the point of Meng Po’s hot soup?”</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal seemed to have anticipated Ranran’s independent and unconventional nature long ago. He flicked his whisk, and the wooden box opened, revealing an ancient bronze mirror hovering in mid-air. It flashed towards Su Yi Shui and Ranran’s foreheads, and two strange lights entered their foreheads.</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui was vigilant and kicked the wooden box along with the bronze mirror, smashing them to pieces, and then glared coldly at the Medicine Immortal.</p>
<p>The Medicine Immortal shook his head helplessly, “Imperial Emperor, you need to improve this temper of yours. Fortunately, this Immortal Mirror is a private item recently acquired by the Holy Mother and not registered in the Immortal Register. Otherwise, you would have violated the Heavenly Rules again with that kick of yours, and will have to get another thunder punishment on the Immortal Execution Platform…”</p>
<p>With that, the Medicine Immortal’s figure gradually became transparent and disappeared, as he left West Mountain.</p>
<p>Ranran was a bit puzzled. Was that bronze mirror supposed to be that fragile? What kind of immortal item was this? Wasn’t it supposed to reveal three lifetimes?</p>
<p>However, since the Medicine Immortal didn’t persist, and she didn’t feel any discomfort, she could easily overlook this incident.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When the two were separated by life and death, they had just gotten married. Now, after six years of separation, the excitement of reunion naturally surpassed that of a new marriage.</p>
<p>Even Shen’er had been found too much of a hindrance by Su Yi Shui and temporarily sent to play at Yutong’s for two days.</p>
<p>Before it was fully dark, Su Yi Shui impatiently dragged Ranran into the curtains of their bed.</p>
<p>Ranran felt that Su Yi Shui’s eagerness didn’t match his immortal like image. But Su Yi Shui told her not to take advantage of the situation and pretend to be coy, “This rebirth of mine also counts as I have handed over both of my virgin bodies to you. You should obviously cherish this and take responsibility. Why are you protesting so much now?”</p>
<p>Ranran was stunned by his shamelessness, but what he said was all factual and reasonable, leaving no room for rebuttal.</p>
<p>Cherishing the virgin body of two lifetimes naturally required effort and dedication. By the time the two embraced each other and fell asleep, it was already the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Since Su Yi Shui’s return, Ranran had not suffered from insomnia at night. This sleep was naturally deep.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>However, not long after falling asleep, she plunged into a dream. </p>
<p>In her dream, she suddenly couldn’t move at all, and there was a lush green leaf blocking her vision.</p>
<p>After a gust of wind blew through and dispersed the leaves, she suddenly realized that she was hanging on a tree. Ranran felt annoyed for a moment, thinking that this dream was rather strange and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>But at this moment, someone below the tree was manipulating a suspended pen on the table, writing something on a scroll. Perhaps tired of writing, the person looked up expressionlessly and stared at her.</p>
<p>When she looked down, she was shocked to see Su Yi Shui standing under the tree… However, in this dream, Su Yi Shui seemed even colder with icy eyes and silver hair, clearly a cultivated immortal.</p>
<p>Behind him were a group of immortals, seemingly chatting and laughing with him, respectfully calling him the YuanYang Emperor, waiting for him to register and arrange an immortal position for themselves.</p>
<p>Facing everyone’s respectful banter, he showed no joy on his face, maintaining an extremely indifferent expression.</p>
<p>Ranran was like a trapped fruit, unable to move freely. However, she felt that her dream was extremely realistic. That ferocious beast had become an immortal in her dream, but still with the same arrogant attitude…</p>
<p>Later on, a voice sounded in the sky, and Ranran heard the invisible Celestial Sovereign speaking again, “YuanYang Emperor, the mortal realm needs an emperor. Many years later, there may be a calamity involving humans and demons. We need a true immortal to respond to the calamity and handle this disaster. Whom do you think should go?”</p>
<p>The YuanYang Emperor replied coldly, “Fellow immortals knows it is difficult to cultivate, and no one has violated the heavenly rules. Who would want to go? Moreover, the trials of the mortal realm are predestined. Such calamitous matters do not need our intervention.”</p>
<p>After hearing this, the Celestial Sovereign sighed, “You were the Boy of Chunyang, ascending to immortality at a young age. Although you have boundless spiritual power, you lack the experience of human emotions. People say that one needs to sever love and emotions to become an immortal, which is a fallacy. If one lacks love and compassion, how can they govern all living beings with benevolence…”<br/>*纯阳童子 <em>how to translate this? Boy of pure masculinity?</em></p>
<p>The YuanYang Emperor heard this, with a faintly mocking smile, he glanced at the fruit on the tree and said, “So the Celestial Sovereign means that because I haven’t married and had children like you, that is why my current cultivation is inferior to yours?”</p>
<p>It was evident that this YuanYang Emperor’s character was too arrogant and unyielding, disrespecting even the Celestial Sovereign. There was a hidden mockery with his reference to how the Celestial Sovereign had failed to protect his daughter—If he truly had compassion, why had the Celestial Sovereign’s own flesh and blood remained hanging on the Bodhi tree by the Yao Chi?</p>
<p>The Celestial Sovereign was treated with contempt, but he was not angry. He simply said, “I know you are unwilling to be limited to the position of the Imperial Emperor, and you even aspire to replace me as the Celestial Sovereign, to control everything. Naturally, it would be good if someone could replace me in the cycle of heaven and earth. However, if you want to achieve higher cultivation and transcend the constraint of the three realms, you may have to tread the path of the demonic immortal. In the thousand years of the heavenly realm, there have been cases of immortals turning demonic, but never demons becoming immortals… If you can’t understand compassion, what use is it even if you ascend further?”</p>
<p>After saying these words, the light in the sky dimmed, and the Celestial Sovereign’s voice gradually disappeared…</p>
<p>The YuanYang Emperor of smiled mockingly, then looked up at the fruit on the Bodhi tree and used a brush to lightly sketch on the fruit. After a few strokes, he turned and left.</p>
<p>After he left, Ranran looked down at the Yao Chi pond under the tree. It clearly reflected a round and cute large fruit.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the fruit had been painted with an ugly face, with a fake smile on its lips.</p>
<p>Obviously, the Imperial Emperor thought that the Celestial Sovereign’s earlier words of his willingness to give up his position were all false, so he drew a hypocritical smile on the Celestial Sovereign’s daughter’s face.</p>
<p>Although it was a dream, Ranran still felt very angry. This was obviously a smooth and good-looking fruit, so why did it have to be painted like this?</p>
<p>However, just now, when the Yuanyang Emperor raised his handsome face and lightly drew on the fruit’s skin with a brush, she felt the fruit she was currently in, had throbbed rapidly like its heartbeat increased, and the fruit seemed restless within the fruit’s skin.</p>
<p>Handsome men are truly dangerous!</p>
<p>He just possessed a handsome face, yet he could even enchant a fruit…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After some time, it seemed like another period had passed. The YuanYang Emperor carried a pot of wine and came to sit under the tree while drinking. It seemed like some immortals were trying to console him, “Emperor, you really shouldn’t antagonize the Celestial Sovereign like that. This time, it seems like the Celestial Sovereign intends to send you down to the mortal realm to experience the tribulation!”</p>
<p>The Emperor, lying half-drunk under the tree, raised his cup and sneered, “Those sent to respond to calamities are burdened with wrongdoing and experience tribulations to atone for their sins. Although he is the Celestial Sovereign, he also needs a valid reason to send me. If I am unwilling to go, what can he do to me? You can all leave and let me be alone…”</p>
<p>Obviously, the earlier celestial banquet had ended with the Imperial Emperor and the Celestial Sovereign not parting on good terms.</p>
<p>At this moment, he was just finding a quiet place near the Yao Chi pond to rest. However Ranran was hopping around on the tree in great anxiety.</p>
<p>Because she noticed that a red-eyed snake with long horns was slowly crawling out next to the tree, moving towards the intoxicated Imperial Emperor.</p>
<p>Immortals in the immortal realm had to discard and refine their distracting thoughts and demonic thoughts from time to time, in order to maintain a state of unity with heaven and man. After these distracting thoughts were refined, they often evolved into spirit snakes and spiders.</p>
<p>Occasionally, if they weren’t cleaned up in time, these poisonous creatures would wander in the heavenly realm.</p>
<p>Although these poisonous creatures were no match for immortals under normal circumstances, the Imperial Emperor had drunk quite a bit of wine. If he were bitten by such a creature, he would undoubtedly be influenced by demonic energy, and affect his cultivation.</p>
<p>Ranran felt that the fruit she was in right now, seemed very anxious and kept shaking a few weak leaves to try to drive away the venomous snake.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the rustling sound had no effect at all!</p>
<p>The fruit seemed so anxious that it was about to burst juice. With a strong effort, it actually broke free from the branch, fell with a bang, scared away the spirit snake, and coincidentally landed in the Imperial Emperor’s arms…</p>
<p>Just then, two child immortals responsible for taking care of the Bodhi tree came over. When they saw the green-skinned unripe fruit fall into the Emperor’s arms, they immediately exclaimed, “This is bad! The Imperial Emperor is drunk and has plucked… plucked the spirit fruit!”</p>

<p>As legends go, a day in heaven is a year on end. <br/>So don’t think badly of the Holy Mother. To her, only a week passed since she last laid eyes on her daughter. <em>hehe</em></p>

<p>This Chapter is for all the loose ends lol <br/>Ranran you may not want to know all the details but we do!<br/>Who else got the impression that the Celestial Sovereign had sneakily manipulated everything?</p>
<p>Honestly, my question is: why wasn’t the fruit being watched 24-7? lol</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">完结 : 一盒福糕</h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:100px"></div>
<p>Ranran’s mind became tumultuous when she heard that accusation. She had previously heard briefly from the Medicine Immortal about the reason why the YuanYang Emperor was demoted to the mortal realm.</p>
<p>But she never expected it to be like this, a complete misunderstanding!</p>
<p>After the Xuan Tian Holy Mother came over in a rage, it then became a miscarriage of justice, like that of Dou E.<br/>*窦娥冤 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Injustice_to_Dou_E" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">The Injustice to Dou E,</a> related to Snow in June</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When the YuanYang Emperor was demoted to the mortal realm to undergo training, he coldly looked at the large fruit being held by the nearby fairy boy.</p>
<p>The fruit’s skin was soaked in heavenly dew, growing brightly red and quite adorable! However, the wide-open mouth he had drawn on it last time was still visible, seemingly mocking him.<br/><em>*this author is really not keeping  proper notes, just the previous chapter the writer said the fruit was unripe and green, now its red and cute … I don’t know which is the right one</em><br/><em>Mu Qingge did favor red in her lifetime haha</em></p>
<p>Despite suffering a great injustice, the Imperial Emperor did not argue. Instead, at the moment of falling into the mortal realm, he suddenly leaped forward and snatched the silly laughing fruit from the fairy boy’s arms and plunged straight into the mortal world…</p>
<p>The Xuan Tian Holy Mother was so shocked that she almost fell down too but she could not hold onto the rebellious Imperial Emperor.</p>
<p>And so, the YuanYang Emperor and the unlucky red fruit descended together into the mortal realm to face their tribulations…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>Ranran felt dizzy and disoriented as she fell with the Imperial Emperor, surrounded by mist and clouds.</p>
<p>This kind of confusing dream really do not feel good at all!</p>
<p>When she regained consciousness, she found herself lying on a boat surrounded by endless green lotus leaves, and she now had hands and feet, but was wearing bright red clothes.</p>
<p>Ranran was puzzled because even in a dream, this red color was definitely not her style!</p>
<p>She also had a wine gourd in her hand, appearing to be leisurely boating and drinking on the lake…</p>
<p>She couldn’t help but looked into the lake, where a charming and lively woman’s reflection appeared… Her lively brows and eyes were quite similar to Xue Ranran herself. Yet Ranran recognized her at a glance. It was her from over twenty years ago, wasn’t it?</p>
<p>Back then, she wasn’t Xue Ranran yet but the carefree Mu Qingge…</p>
<p>Just then, her boat suddenly collided head-on with another approaching boat.</p>
<p>The impact was strong, directly knocking a young couple out of the opposing boat’s cabin.</p>
<p>Ranran looked closely and saw a remarkably handsome young man, despite looking only fifteen or sixteen. His face already showed a divine charm, with clear brows and bright eyes exuding youthful vigor…</p>
<p>As she stared blankly, Ranran had only one thought in her mind: Shifu was so charming and cute when he was a youth…</p>
<p>Yes, although the young man was much younger, Ranran immediately recognized him as the young Su Yi Shui. He was indeed fresh and tender!</p>
<p>Even in her dream, Ranran felt like she was staring so hard and about to drool.</p>
<p>But before she could wipe her mouth, she noticed a young girl next to the young man was actually holding onto Su Yi Shui’s arm!</p>
<p>Ranran glared angrily but found the girl familiar. She looked like Wen Hongshan before she had been disfigured and twenty years younger!</p>
<p>Although Ranran had long known they had almost been married, the delayed jealousy hit her even harder.</p>
<p>She wanted to shout loudly, telling Wen Hongshan to release her claws and let go of her husband.</p>
<p>But when she actually spoke, it came out in a casual careless tone, “This young gentleman looks really good. I feel inexplicably happy just looking at him. Our meeting at West Lake must be fate… I am Mu Qingge from Xishan. How about you become my disciple and return to West Mountain with me to cultivate immortality?”</p>
<p>Although the words came out of her mouth, but they were completely out of her control!</p>
<p>Although she knew what she said was sincere, when heard by a stranger that just met, it sounded like a dandy flirting with a respectable lady!</p>
<p>Indeed, the young man’s face turned frosty after hearing such disrespectful words. Although he was at first stunned when he saw the woman in red, after the initial amazement, there was an instinctive dislike, especially towards her red clothes, making her look like a round red fruit as she squatted there on the boat… just really displeasing to the eye!</p>
<p>After hearing her frivolous words, he coldly said, “I am a disciple of Jiuhua Sect. There’s no need to take another master. Thank you for the kind offer from Xishan’s leader…” With that, he shook slightly underfoot, separating the boats that had collided, displaying his formidable spiritual power.</p>
<p>Ranran felt a sudden joy, a sense of wanting talent as if she had struck gold: “Your foundation is really good! What can you learn from Jiuhua Sect’s hypocritical gentleman spouting righteousness? It’s a pity, it’s a pity… It’s better to change your path early and come to my West Mountain!”</p>
<p>The young man’s face became even colder after Mu Qingge’s disrespectful words. Wen Hongshan also shouted angrily, “Mu Qingge! You collect handsome young men everywhere, your bad reputation precedes you! However, Yi Shui is pure and not someone you, a devil, can provoke. Leave now and don’t make trouble for yourself!”</p>
<p>She didn’t realize that her words were counterproductive, actually arousing Mu Qingge’s rare competitive spirit.</p>
<p>She raised her wine gourd high, took a sip of pure brew, and then laughed loudly, saying, “Oh? Then I really must make a bet with you. Do you believe that I will make him call me master within three days?”</p>
<p>Once she said this, not only Wen Hongshan but even Su Yi Shui’s lips curled in a scornful smile: “Oh? What are we betting on?”</p>
<p>Mu Qingge, in her red attire and frivolous manner, laughed and said, “If I lose, I will kowtow the whole way to Jiuhua Sect to apologize to that old man Kaiyuan. But if you call me master, you must change allegiance to West Mountain and become my obedient disciple!”</p>
<p>Hearing this absurd bet, the young man’s face showed a confident smile, “Are you serious?”</p>
<p>Ignoring the handsome disciples behind her trying to dissuade her, Mu Qingge readily said, “I mean what I say. Now, do you dare to make a soul oath with me?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui smile coldly, “Why not?”</p>
<p>Thinking of this frivolous woman in red, kowtowing the entire way from the foot of Jiuhua Mountain, Su Yi Shui actually really felt like he was looking forward to it!</p>
<p>Xue Ranran couldn’t believe that back when she was still Mu Qingge, she had recruited Su Yi Shui in such a manner.</p>
<p>Although it was in a dream, the scenes kept jumping, yet Xue Ranran pieced together the story from a few scenes. Mu Qingge going to Elder Jiu’s place and exchanged a few illusion charms with a pot of “Detain Heaven’s Immortal” brew. Then she cleverly set up a scene, transforming into the appearance of Master Kaiyuan before Su Yi Shui and Wen Hongshan, pretending to be ambushed by disciples of West Mountain, and feigning serious injuries lying on the ground.</p>
<p>The following events unfolded smoothly, like sheep’s milk, without experiencing too many dangers when he had been cultivating immortality, the young Su Yi Shui knelt beside the “master Kaiyuan ” without any suspicion, calling out “Master” without reservation.</p>
<p>Even when the disguise charms lost their effect, Su Yi Shui couldn’t help but stare at Mu Qingge’s face, hesitating as he addressed her, “Master?”</p>
<p>“Oh! My good boy Shui’er, from now on, Master will dote on you most!” Mu Qingge said with a smile, dodging while the young man, angry and roaring, pulled out his sword and aimed it at her, intending to kill his newly minted master. Ranran could only helplessly stay in Mu Qingge’s disguise, leaping and frolicking inside Mu Qingge’s skin, teasing her new disciple little Shui. But what she really wanted to do, was find a corner to shed tears, lamenting the long and tumultuous master-disciple relationship ahead.</p>
<p>Next, Su Yi Shui became increasingly silent and expressionless after he had to switch his apprenticeship to Xishan, due to the power of the soul oath.</p>
<p>Xue Ranran watched her enthusiastically come up against Su Yi Shui’s cold shoulder many times, and watched her try hard to please her rebellious disciple Su Yi Shui time and again, really wishing to wake up right away and cool down with a bowl of melon shaved ice!</p>
<p>Her disciple Zeng Yi seemed unable to bear it and privately asked his master why she tolerated the disobedient and rebellious Su Yi Shui. But as Mu Qingge was putting the ice lotus for Su Yi Shui’s injuries into the pool, she sighed, “I don’t know why, but I always feel like I have done him wrong in my past life.”</p>
<p>Zeng Yi shook his head and turned to persuade Su Yi Shui not to always oppose his master.</p>
<p>After that, the scene shifted, and Mu Qingge, after saving an old woman bitten by a snake in the mountains, was led into an illusion and saw a blank book placed on a life-transcending stone.</p>
<p>When she opened the pages, the blank paper was filled with the past fate of Mu Qingge and Su Yi Shui, as well as their future.</p>
<p>It was clear from the book that as long as Mu Qingge severed her connection with Su Yi Shui in a timely manner, they wouldn’t meet again in this life, and she could focus on cultivating immortality and ascending to the heavens again. But Mu Qingge had quickly skimmed over her own fate and carefully examined Su Yi Shui’s fate chart. He was burdened with heavenly punishment and the tribulations of the mortal world. Any misstep would lead to his fall and inability to ascend to the heavens again.</p>
<p>However, if she could change his fate chart, erase his imperial destiny, and then offer her life as a sacrifice, he could get enlightenment early, ascend as a demon’s son, and return to the heavenly realm as a demon immortal and live a long life. Xue Ranran could feel the turmoil Mu Qingge was experiencing in her heart.</p>
<p>That day, she tore out a page from the heavenly book, watched the fate chart on the page change with her various different plans, and she pondered for a very long time. Finally, she went to Dragon Island, entrusted the Dragon Island’s goddess to bury the page containing the heavenly book. She made up her mind. In her past life, she had fallen from a tree by herself and caused the YuanYang Emperor to suffer unjustly. So, in this life, she should compensate him with an unparalleled bright future instead.</p>
<p>When she accepted him as her disciple, she had promised that… With this in mind, Mu Qingge finally laughed and got up, resolutely heading towards the human world filled with turbidity and dust.</p>
<p>At that moment, Ranran didn’t know what she was feeling. She finally understood why she, as Mu Qingge, had sacrificed her life to change Su Yi Shui’s fate. It was all because in the past life under the tree in the heavenly realm, the white haired Imperial Emperor, who made a little fruit blush, had said he wanted to cultivate into a demon immortal and replace the Celestial Sovereign…</p>
<p>In the following days, she proactively supported Su Yu, in order to let Su Yi Shui stay away from the troubles of the mortal world’s power struggles. At the same time, she found Su Yi Shui in the secret mansion in the capital, when he had been unable to resist the control of the spirit spring, and accompanied him in that empty room to resist the invasion of inner demons.</p>
<p>She watched him suffer and couldn’t bear it, scratching traces into the walls with his nails in the secret room, tearfully saying, “You can do it, if you can’t even endure this, when will you defeat me and graduate smoothly?”</p>
<p>Ranran had been to the capital and saw the mottled marks in the secret room, but it wasn’t until she saw this dream scene that she realized she had also been in this secret room twenty years ago.</p>
<p>At this moment, the candlelight in the secret room flickered, and only the master and disciple, who had always had a strained relationship, endured difficult times together. Mu Qingge didn’t notice Su Yi Shui’s gaze becoming complex, no longer just filled with hatred but also with an indescribable feeling.</p>
<p>“If I resist the spirit spring, would you promise me one thing?” he weakly leaned against her shoulder and asked.</p>
<p>“What thing?” Mu Qingge asked, gently touching his long hair.</p>
<p>“I want to leave West Mountain and dissolve the master-disciple relationship with you!” his words of severing the master-disciple relationship was cold, but his expression was uneasy and awkward, as if there were still some words left unsaid. Mu Qingge just smiled wryly at his words and sighed deeply, “If you can cooperate with me, let me remove the spirit spring for you, and let me seal it, I will publicly announce that you, Su Yi Shui, have cut ties with West Mountain’s demonic path, and you will no longer be my disciple…”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui looked at her and hesitantly reached out as if to touch her cheek, but in the end, he just lightly touched her hanging long hair. In the next moment, the situation changed drastically. She had been surrounded by disciples from the three major sects. They questioned her about the demon son carrying the spirit spring, and she just smiled slightly and said, “You group of mobs, how can you be my opponents? If you’re not afraid of death, come at me!”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because she had helped Su Yi Shui resist the control of the spirit spring, Mu Qingge had long expended most of her vitality. Just as Su Yi Shui had rushed over anxiously, she had just repelled an attack from Mu Ranwu, but in the moment of distraction, Mu Ranwu tightly hugged her and stuffed a spirit jade to her hand, causing her to cough up blood after she was struck and her soul to almost dissipate.</p>
<p>She smiled as she watched Su Yi Shui’s veins bulging, as he ran towards her frantically, shouting something in his mouth, probably unwilling to see her die at someone else’s hands instead of his?</p>
<p>Her disciple Shui’er was truly incomparable in the mortal world! Even when he roared in anger right now, he still looked so handsome and charming. She was about to perish. What if he really encountered a demon lord who coveted his beauty, and he couldn’t protect himself?</p>
<p>As she was taking her last breath, Mu Qingge used the last of her spiritual power to transform into a melting-face curse, sealing his handsome face…</p>
<p>As for when the curse would be lifted? That would be when he meets the person who truly stirs his heart, when his own thirst becomes unbearable…</p>
<p>By then, her little Shui’er would surely be the most capable demon immortal in the heavenly realm, being with the one who could stir his heart under the Yaochi divine tree, together for ten thousand years…</p>
<p>Ranran knew clearly that this was just a dream, but it was too vivid of a dream, coupled with an immersive state of mind, causing her to involuntarily shed tears, letting her scattered soul gradually blur.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>After who knows how long, a gust of wind blew, and she found herself hanging from a half-dead tree again, only this time, she was much weaker, and there was a fruit beside her, much larger than her, desperately absorbing her spiritual energy.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be long before she couldn’t hold on anymore. Looking around at the scenery, this seemed to be the Jue Mountain above the Juefeng Village! Here, it was silent and deserted, not a place ordinary people could approach…</p>
<p>But just then, a strange masked man dressed in old robes and long hair suddenly appeared under the tree. He raised his head, unable to see his facial features clearly, woodenly sizing up the two fruits, one large and one small.</p>
<p>After a long time, he spoke softly, “Weren’t you always free-spirited? Never willing to compromise yourself, why did you end up being bullied like this after hanging on a tree… But it’s also good, Wei Jiu has been sending people to pour grudge water on you. If you fall earlier, you can avoid the persecution of many malicious people… Unfortunately, you can’t stray too far from the reincarnation tree… Didn’t you always say you had no karmic fate with parents? How about I find you parents who truly love and cherish children? This time, you don’t need to worry about doing things early, don’t need any malicious sisters, just be an only child, grow up happily being loved by parents…”</p>
<p>After saying that, he turned and went down the mountain towards the Juefeng Village below.</p>
<p>When she could no longer hold on, falling from the tree with the fruit, she heard the clear cry of a baby coming from her mouth. That clear cry, piercing through layers of fog, attracted a woman with a loving face, “Who would be so heartless? Actually leaving a newborn baby in the wilderness! What a sin! What a sin! Don’t cry, I’ll take you back right away, be good…”</p>
<p>Ranran recognized that the woman holding her was her mother, Qiao Lian. She took off her patched outer garment, carefully wrapping up the baby Ranran, and then slowly descended the Jue Mountain step by step.</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>This dream was so long and chaotic that when Ranran woke up, the sun was already high. She blinked slowly, looking at the familiar canopy bed curtains above her head, then quickly turned to look at Su Yi Shui beside her. Thankfully Su Yi Shui was still lying there by her side, but he seemed to have been awake for a while, gazing at her quietly.</p>
<p>Ranran pressed her face against his chest, feeling his beating heart, and said softly, “I… had a dream…”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui spoke in a low voice, “Was it a dream of the Bodhi tree by the Yaochi, and you crashed into me?”</p>
<p>Ranran raised her head abruptly, staring at him in surprise, “How… did you also have the same dream as me?”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui said mildly, “That wasn’t a dream, but the Three Life Mirror brought by the Medicine Immortal, which showed us our past three lives…”</p>
<p>Ah? Ranran finally understood the intent of the Three Life Mirror sent by the Holy Mother.</p>
<p>It turned out that all the grievances and affections between her and Su Yi Shui originated from the accidental fallen fruit by the Yaochi. Was the Xuantian Holy Mother hoping that this would sow discord between them, and so they would part ways?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Ranran braced herself and said softly, “We exchanged vows in front of heaven and earth, although they are not as powerful as soul oaths, they are still binding. You can’t be petty… and seek to settle such old scores with me!”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui clamped her chin, coldly saying, “If you dare to act, you must be prepared to face the consequences. You, just a tiny little fruit, have messed up my fate chart, and caused me to suffer so much in the mortal world, how can it be dismissed with just a few casual words?”</p>
<p>Hearing him being so harsh, Ranran felt a wave of sadness, her nose and eyes reddening, “Then… what do you want?”</p>
<p>They say that a broken mirror can be mended, but in her case, it seemed like a mirror was going to break her marriage.</p>
<p>Could it be that the former YuanYang Emperor now knew all about this past and wanted to settle old scores with her?</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui looked at her tearful expression coldly, but couldn’t bear it for long before he hugged her tenderly, pinching her red nose, “What can I do? The Celestial Sovereign said, without understanding love, how can one show compassion? He already intended for me to experience the mortal world, even if you hadn’t fallen on me, he would have found other excuses to make that happen. But as for you, tell me honestly, did you already fall for me back when you were in heaven?”</p>
<p>Ranran wanted to deny it at first, but he sealed her mouth with his warmth, and when they separated, he whispered softly, “No denying, you can only have loved me…”</p>
<p>Ranran extended her slender arms, wrapping them around his neck, recalling the part of the dream where they were in the secret room in the capital, Su Yi Shui wanted to dissolve the master-disciple relationship with her, severing their ties.</p>
<p>At that time, she had exhausted her vitality for him, but he was still so ruthless, wanting to cut ties with her.</p>
<p>But Su Yi Shui murmured, “Without leaving West Mountain, aren’t you still my master? Then how can I propose to you and become your husband?”</p>
<p>Ranran, wide eyed with surprise, “You…Didn’t your affection came about with gratitude only after my death? Did you already…”</p>
<p>Su Yishui smoothly pressed down the woman he had loved for two lifetimes onto the bed. He whispered softly, “Don’t you know how captivating you are? If I don’t subdue you, won’t you attract and trouble more young men?”</p>
<p>In a moment, the scene of the former master of Xishan subduing the little demoness unfolded again, and the window filled with flowers once again sounded with laughter and soft moans…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:10px"></div>
<p>When the Medicine Immortal appeared again, it was three days later. Watching the pair below West Mountain catching fireflies to put into their paper lanterns in the sea of flowers with their son, he vaguely understood that the Xuan Tian Holy Mother’s divine mirror had been brought in vain.</p>
<p>The former Immortal Fruit and Imperial Emperor had both experienced the mortal world, and understood the taste of love. But while everything else could be predicted, the word “love” was difficult to write clearly in the Heavenly Book. Once a karmic relationship is entangled, it’s hard to break free from.</p>
<p>Ranran saw the Medicine Elder visiting again, and was not surprised. She smiled and handed him a box of sweet pea pudding she had made herself. These were cakes often made by mortal children to celebrate their mother’s birthday, and this box was for the Xuantian Holy Mother.</p>
<p>“Master Immotal, as the gates of heaven are not yet open, and I am now a mortal, I cannot ascend to see the Holy Mother. Please pass her this box of cakes as a token of my filial piety. Please convey a message for me, telling her not to blame herself anymore for not being able to protect her unborn child during her ascension years ago. I appreciate everything she has done for me, and perhaps in the future, Yi Shui and I can have fate to cultivate and ascend to immortality. When that time comes, I will personally make fortune cakes for her again…”</p>
<p>Ranran’s mind was astute, naturally understanding the Holy Mother’s inner conflict. She, like Duntian, suffered daily self-reproach.</p>
<p>This was the Holy Mother’s demons, which is why she redirected her anger towards the Imperial Emperor, finding it hard to forgive him.</p>
<p>She made this box of fortune cakes herself, hoping that even the cooling pea-yellow cakes could help ease the inner conflicts of her mother from her past life. The Medicine Elder nodded in agreement and took the box.</p>
<p>However, Ranran noticed keenly that Medicine Immortals’s forehead mark seemed to have changed. It had shifted from the green mark of a lower immortal to the purple mark of the Higher immortals.</p>
<p>Upon inquiry, she learned that he had replaced Purple Light Immortal and became one of the eight Higher Immortals. It seemed that Purple Light Immortal Lord had violated some heavenly rules due to insufficient training and would soon descend to the mortal realm to face calamities.</p>
<p>Ranran was somewhat speechless, and realizing that even immortals could be influenced by the pillow talk of their wives. She wondered if the Medicine Immortal’s swift rise was related to his ability to read the situation and take the right stance. The next afternoon, as Ranran set up a table in the courtyard and called her husband and son to eat, Shen’er pointed at the clouds in the western sky with chopsticks, saying, “Mother, look quickly, doesn’t that cloud look like the fortune cake you made the day before yesterday?”</p>
<p>Ranran looked up at the western sky, at the piled-up clouds… It did look like a fortune cake, as if someone was slowly eating it, the cloud-made cake disappearing bit by bit, as the person couldn’t bear to eat it, and couldn’t bear to swallow.</p>
<p>Ranran leaned against Su Yi Shui’s embrace, smiled contentedly, and whispered something in her son’s ear. Shen Er stood on the table, puffing his little belly, and shouted loudly, “Grandmother Xuantian, eat heartily with big bites, my mother will make more for you in the future!”</p>
<p>Su Yi Shui also whispered a few words to his son, and Shen’er shouted again, “Grandfather Heavenly Sovereign, my father said he doesn’t care about your position anymore! But he will love and care for your daughter well, and be your good son-in-law!”</p>
<p>The childish voice echoed far and wide through the mountains and streams, shattering the broken clouds in the sky, creating a captivating rainbow…</p>
<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:50px"></div>
<p>“<strong>The Chronicles of the West Mountain Sect</strong>” records:</p>
<p>After a hundred years of cultivation with her husband, the West Mountain Sect Leader Xue Ranran vanquished demons and evil spirits, purifying the mortal world, and then her traces faded into obscurity. Her son inherited the leadership of the West Mountain Sect. The details of their celestial fate are not something outsiders should speculate about.</p>
